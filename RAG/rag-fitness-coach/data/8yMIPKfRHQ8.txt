oh we're gucci
yo
it's friday night
and uh let's be honest i don't have
anything to do
because i don't see any friends around
scott the video guys here
monitoring live
he's not a friend he's a paid employee
and uh you guys clearly have nothing
better to do than join me for friday
night live oh maybe about two hours of q
a
and uh
just a general all-around terrible jokes
and it looks like the terrible jokes
were started by
the hiking viking who says
this is not a question by the way i just
thought this was hilarious scott the
video guy of course noticed it first
hiking vikings says we have one hour
before my wife gets home
this led to a series of jokes between
scott and i into which i proposed a
potential youtube video where maybe i
read a snippet of
50
oh scott we're good
gucci
maybe i can read a snippet of uh
50 shades of grey
um
on the channel wouldn't it be fun i've
never read the book
uh you know i prefer my s m the other
way around if you can figure that one
out any case before we get canceled
again
again
let's get to the questions
so never lose your nerd
who's hopefully found
says found your channel a few weeks ago
and i've been binging your videos ever
since such great informative content
you are now my favorite fitness channel
well never lose your nerd thank you so
much it's very kind hopefully we can
wear on you over the past
next several weeks and months and
eventually become your least favorite
fitness channel but
that's our goal with most of our members
all right to
the question
never lose your nerd asked
what do you think of my workout split
day one chest and back day two biceps
triceps day three shoulders legs rest
and repeat four workouts each muscle
group three sets of eight to ten reps
so the four exercises i assume exercise
for each muscle group sounds fine i
would advise you to condense it to two
or three sometimes even one to two
exercises
uh three sets of eight ten reps is fine
though i would uh prefer an adaptive
autoregulated model where like you know
when you start a plan you start with
like two sets of everything and if you
know if that works great amazing if
you're getting great pumps great someone
has great recovery awesome if your pumps
and soreness uh start to get a little
bit not so great and your recovery is
just like over the top you could train
tomorrow even though you're not planning
to train a day later
then i would say go up to three sets and
then potentially four and then five and
then have to deload
as far as
the
split itself
generally speaking
uh it looks good so you're in the clear
uh though however because you asked a
question i'm trying to answer pretty
well and i will say that chest and back
together
uh that's a lot of effort and one of
those workouts is inevitably going to
suffer
not suffer in some kind of catastrophic
way but i suppose could
be done
in a more stimulative way if it is
placed uh away from another difficult
workout
biceps triceps together is baller as
shit but the thing is that neither one
of those muscles are very hard to train
so what you're gonna end up having is on
day one chest and back
you're gonna be pushing in a lot of
effort for not as much return
for day two biceps and triceps you're
gonna be pushing not so much effort
or great return but you could be doing
more so i would prefer something more
like
chest triceps back biceps shoulders legs
or
chest
biceps back triceps shoulders legs
something like that i think balances the
stimuli a little bit better
just a bit so
shoulders legs is cool
uh in a very unconventional take i would
recommend you do shoulders first
after a hard leg workout you ain't doing
it except laying on the ground covering
your own sweat hopefully fecal matter
and getting kicked out of the gym for
shitting yourself again
i've been through a lot of gems like
that so
yeah that's my feedback hopefully it um
hits you in the right spot
and all right next up is
sean f
asks best active recovery methods by
body part good news sean it's all the
same for all all of the muscle groups
generally in active recovery you want
two things to be present
one is a very low volume and load and
relative effort so it's gonna be easy
generally speaking active recovery
probably falls in the
below 50
of what is considered overloading on
volume
what is considered overloading on
repetitions
and um
if those two things are hit
then uh as long as you know like the
load is also
the load is negotiable but generally for
true active recovery even the load is 50
volume reps load cut by half from your
typical training
for that muscle group which means it's
very easy
and two what i would highly recommend
is a slower eccentric with a pause on
many of the lifts whichever lifts it's
possible to do
such that you get
um i've tended to notice this
corroborated by literature to some
extent slow eccentrics with pauses do a
good bit of stretching to the muscle and
um
seem to maybe do some justice to
i don't think moving scar tissue around
in a technical sense but pulling some
things apart getting yourself
essentially for lack of a better term
limber kind of like in rehab they go
through four ranges of motion just to
make sure you're you're moving around
and getting everything sort of warmed up
and and working properly and that tends
to do really good things for the joints
and for the muscles so that would be my
recommendation
and i would also say that um the best
thing you can do for active recovery is
a few sessions like that but also
interspersed with lots of rest what i
would hate for you to do is to do a hard
crazy hard monday tuesday wednesday
workouts series thursday do active
recovery which could be nice and then
friday go right back into hard training
a much better way to do it would be
monday wednesday friday crush it if this
is a peak of your mesocycle and you need
a little bit of rest so you do some
active recovery
and
what you end up doing is uh getting into
wednesday off thursday active recovery
friday
off saturday active recovery
sunday off
then start your new push into harder
training after that
um and i'm here assuming by active
recovery you mean rest
active recovery has another connotation
in sport training and that's like
between your sets of whatever sort of
sprints for example you're doing you
could walk or jog or do some kind of
plyos to get the um recovery to occur so
you can have another great sprint
session afterwards because if you sprint
hard for example if you just sit it
actually starts to accumulate lots of
metabolites get your tissues less
pliable and then your next sprint
session would work poorly the thing is
that works great for sport training
because you don't want that sort of
metabolite accumulation and the
beginning of those pathways ascendant in
hypertrophy and strength training you do
actually want that to happen uh in most
cases so don't do formal active recovery
in the gym save it for the athletic
endeavors
all right on to as they questioned
we just skipped like a thousand i love
it i love the ui
i'm gonna stop bitching about youtube
because it's amazing
all right
last time i bitched about bill gates
that did not go well
am hoops asks
i keep fidgeting with my technique
trying to get it quote unquote perfect
especially on leg press hack spot etc
what should i do i think you should keep
fidgeting
and try to get it perfect but it never
will be and i want that half a percent
of bad technique to eat away at you you
eat your meals you think about how
terrible you are technique how unperfect
you are you go to sleep you wake up to
pee at night
jk um
there's nothing wrong with trying to get
it perfect but i would look at it as
kind of a very open-ended positive
attitude situation rather than a
closed-loop negative attitude situation
so like the opposite of what a
high-level gymnast would look at
something like so
once you get your technique really
really good like
you're fucking in the clear and you're
doing great shit
and if you notice a convincing
repeatable element that you assess that
you are doing wrong
try to
correct it and if the effort of
correcting it is relatively small and
the hypothetical payout is relatively
large correct it move on and then your
technique is even better on the other
hand if you have to ask yourself the
question of
okay is this technique correction even a
thing that i need to be doing better
i'm worried about it but i'm not sure
just don't fucking do it and if you
really really really need to know just
join team full rom on facebook get in
our forum post the videos of your
training that you want technique
corrected and we'll beat it all to death
so it's black and blue police are taking
photos of it god damn
what happened here well there's
technique corrections brutal we need to
find these people's staff charlie gets
arrested you know the rest in any case
yeah i just wouldn't worry about it much
just do a great job and if you think you
can improve on something and there's
like a clear way to improve do it if
you're worried you're like i don't know
if i should be worried about this the
answer is probably not
scott the video guy just came and like
hit a button on the camera i'm to assume
i've been speaking into the void for
this entire time
that's what i want you to think
i've been uh led to believe i've been on
youtube live this whole time and i've
never actually done a youtube live
alright
next up is
24 swiffer
who asks hey mike long or lateral head
for
bench press thanks
um
i assume the question is about triceps
i'll say two things
one the long head is generally not
what is going to be uh highly targeted
during the bench press that tends to be
more targeted as overhead movements
another thing i would say is
i don't think i've ever once seen anyone
implement a resistance training program
that preferentially targets some heads
versus others of muscles and seen a
visual notable change that they could go
back and say this was worth it
inner quad outer quad inner triceps and
that different heads of the bicep
other than obvious divisions that have
biomechanically easy separations such as
lower pack upper pack like press like
this versus press like that i just
straight up wouldn't even bother with
the shit
just do a variety of exercises from
multiple angles that have high stimulus
to fatigue ratios keep the variation
decent but keep the progressive overload
and specificity good for a few months
change a few months change and you're
you're fucking totally golden um
and i mean that i wouldn't give you this
uh question i wouldn't give this answer
if i didn't think it was uh
not positive i'm not trying to be like
that shit man book nerd science you just
look get in there and lift
but like some of that shit is valid so i
wouldn't overthink it too much
all right edward smith says hello dr
mike
hello edward mr smith agent smith maybe
even
question about reps 42 years old oh
that's too old next question we don't
know
uh even though i i be worked out over
the years i just started again do you
have a suggestion on rep range for
beginner gains absolutely the 5 to 10
repetition range with weights that are
not super challenging quite yet so you
can master your technique again focus on
technique sets of 5 to 10 for almost
everything and then as your technique
really begins to stabilize and you're
like damn i'm i'm fucking rocking the
shit then you do uh
harder weights and harder weights and
harder weights until a few months later
like the weights are really tough and
you're grinding close to failure once
that happens you're going to knock these
beginner gains the fuck out of the water
your technique is going to be really
solid
and then after that you can branch out
into the 5 to 10 and maybe 10 to 20
range and a couple
geez maybe even years later you can
branch out on a 20 to 30 range if
there's a good stimulus to fatigue ratio
for you there
we looking at are you looking at scott
the video guys just making sure the ship
sales motherfucker you got you got some
something to say we can fight it out on
this live bruh
nobody playing with you
beefing
that'd be a great video thumbnail scott
the video guy versus dr mike beef then
greg dussette could cover it
what's going on with our channel who's
scott the video guy
we can't keep it together
all right
akshay
anvikar asks how to get a big
dumpster like the one you got
well typically there are rental services
for dumpsters and you can choose by size
you pay more for the big dumpsters but
if you have a lot
of stuff you're cleaning out of your
garage the big dumpster is worth it and
they do catch you on these prices though
because the little dumpster
is like 500 or whatever to rent the
humongous dumpster it's like 600 dollars
god damn it i know i don't need the
humongous dumpster but what if so get
the 600 one it's probably worth it and
the dumpster companies are they're good
people
but on a serious note i assume you mean
the gluteus region
the one i got is just a side effect of
me doing squats and lunges and deadlifts
for a long time um
i'm a little gifted in the rear
department if you know what i mean
that's what my pastor said to me when i
was 10 anyway
yeah
then my rabbi
and my imam
all different ages of course
i guess uh i guess this thing attracts
the the boys so to speak in any case
yeah um i don't know progressive
overload over time and exercises that
tend to pump your glutes and or make
them sore or some combination full range
of motion lifting at a stretch
stiff-legged deadlifts
uh good mornings all sorts of loot
thrusts and glute bridges and lunges
lunges lunges lunges lunges until you
feel like a bikini girl and i'll launch
some more
okay
uh oh trevor fulbright's in this chat
the god king of full rom himself
all right
brian compton
mr brian compton
thank you so much for your generous
donation but i noticed that it did not
come
with a question
so please ask your question and we'll be
happy to answer
all right next up is coarser dev says
hey dr mike i do jiu jitsu plus
kickboxing for three hours and
weightlifting daily goddamn don't fight
this motherfucker
knock your block off
i feel slightly fatigued sometimes but i
want to build muscle because i'm small
for the sport what should i focus on
i would do
a phase of training that lasts about
eight to twelve weeks
where i would take my jiu jitsu and
kickboxing and reduce it to an amount
daily
that can only be good for maintaining
your jiu jitsu and kickboxing skills and
not much more than that which is to say
it's probably good
for you to do some flow rolling
that lasts maybe 20 minutes
per session three times a week
and uh just some probably like bag work
or just flow sparring in kickboxing that
lasts also that long and then spend the
rest of your time up to your maximum
recovery volume investing in compound
heavy basic exercises in the gym
progressively overload eat plenty of
food gain a little bit of weight you'll
be stronger bigger and then after that
period start to slowly thread in more
jiu jitsu and kickboxing training take
your weight training down to like 45
minutes per session three times a week
enough to maintain keep eating well and
high levels of protein if you gain
weight during that time make sure your
weight doesn't fall off once you start
doing just good juts in kickboxing
sometime later a few months later take
an active rest phase two weeks of doing
almost nothing come back and repeat that
process and slowly you'll get more
checked
great great question
all right
uh okay yeah folks for those of you
giving a super chat money thank you so
much money's great mostly because
well you know the story already the
lamborghini is unfortunately not free i
am having a petition that i'm bringing
to the italian government that um is
like i think lamborghinis are kind of a
civil right at this point and i think
they should be universal and free for
all so i'm go if you guys want to get in
on that let's do it let's make these
changes it's 2022 it's about time the
people rose up
um
but for those of you folks giving us
money thank you so much for those of you
giving us money without asking questions
unbelievably generous of you but it
makes me feel mildly uncomfortable
because before anything i am a business
person and a jew and that means i need
to fulfill high quality products and
services so please do ask a question and
then i can i can sleep at night
i don't sleep at night anyway
i just plan
all right
oh thank god youtube scrolled us down
forever
hold please as i scroll up
okay
all right travis denney the travis denny
huge huge uh well
james and i are huge fans of you and so
is jared feather because you have an
excellent last name
travis says when i do sldls i get doms
for three or four days after and lower
back gets fried as well sounds like
you're winning all over
so
would it be i guess the missing word is
good to pre-exhaust with light crosstalk
produce those problems um travis
those aren't problems those are
solutions what you can do is do like a
set or two less of sldls and then get
doms for only two or three days and then
you'll be able to train it twice a week
so i think
gee
yeah you're winning all around and uh
because your shit gets soared because
you get fried eat well sleep well and
that's the antecedent of hypertrophy so
if you if you reverse this question and
said hey when i do slds i don't get sore
and my back doesn't get fried i'd be
like
huh
yes you should pre-exhausted leg curls
and or i would like to see your
technique
okay
big el corleone hey
leon whoa
says if i'm on a cut but won't be able
to train for a while when should i go
back to maintenance calories in order to
impede muscle loss
asap asap i probably wouldn't cut
without training with
weights because then the muscle loss
will just be concurrent to your
your hypochloric diet so yeah if you
can't train with weights just go to
maintenance i know it's the boring
shitty answer but it's just true
and it's just true
all right
next up
the hiking viking instant instant
classic of a name
i get you know i thought let's say for
all the things vikings did and could do
hiking is maybe the most
boring
you know
although maybe they're hiking into
battle
yeah yeah yeah we'll say that
i get that you need 0.8 grams of protein
per pound of body weight
is that for current weight or goal
weight
it is for current weight
i will also say that your goal weight
should be close enough to your current
weight so that almost all real world
calculations yield roughly the same
protein amount so if your goal weight is
215 but your current weight is 200
pounds it's almost the same number and
if you eat a gram of protein per pound
of bodyweight per day you cover all the
bases
technically speaking your goal weight
has almost nothing to do with how much
protein you eat
your goal weight has everything to do
with the calories that you're eating so
make sure the calories reflect the goal
weight and that you're inching your way
up slowly over the weeks to your goal
weight but the protein won't get you
there i wish it did i just need more
protein i wouldn't have to stuff myself
matter of fact right for this live i
wolf down this this bowl of trifecta
turkey burgers which are actually
fucking amazing
white rice and a little bit of ranch
powder
oh ranch
yeah
i own a ranch and uh scott where is the
cayman islands or something the butler's
tent to the ranch i don't know where it
is i actually don't know where it is
a ranch on tropical island yeah yeah
with horses and everything they hate the
heat
um but we keep them there because wealth
needs to be uh stated um
the reason i don't go to my ranch is
because i'm too busy starting drop
shipping businesses
can't be bothered
garyvee
all right sam
asks for a power lifter moving up
classes would you bulk to the class
weight and recomp from there or bulk
past it and cut back down
so first of all i would do this in
multiple phases because an entire class
movement is usually a lot of muscle
side bulk maintain cut bulk maintain cut
as many cycles as it takes to get you to
do your question
over the class and then cut down so you
can be lean for your weight lean for
your weight
recomping just doesn't work nearly as
well as gaining muscle purposefully with
a massing phase and then cutting
purposefully with a fat loss phase
so yes great great question do overdo it
so if you need to weigh like 90 kilos uh
whatever your weight class is for
for powerlifting then you know yeah i
would probably mess up at a good decent
condition to like
93 to 95 and then definitely don't cut
before the meat cut months and months
away from the meat so that you're nice
and lean
and you can actually make 90 and then
you don't really have much muscle to put
on
oh shit
this is bad news yeah yeah yeah
i come around folks good news bad news
the good news is
i don't know what the good news is the
bad news is is rp ceo mr nick shaw
just walked into our live
yeah that's fine because you can't see
his head
i just gotta check out how everything
works man yes this is the behind the
scenes
guys nick keeps me in a compound to work
for rp against my will help
blink twice if you need help
i blink a lot anyway you know
i do like the comments when people are
like you blink a lot and i'm like yes i
know
thank you okie doke
been trying to stop it
yeah
we think it's up to standards up to
snuff oh this is great
it's awesome
yep so we just answered sam and then we
scroll down and answer the next person
that's it
all right thanks
while you're here
jesus christ you guys ever been put on
the spot like this by your boss all
right
oh my this question is asked by a person
with a symbol that looks like the prince
artist formerly known as
so you know who you are
my prescriptive
cult leader
considering the hypertrophic virtue of
getting more out of less weight
are mechanically disadvantaged exercises
better yes absolutely what an amazing
question by
a person who will now be referred to as
prince
um yes and it's funny because so
mechanically
mechanically advantaged exercises are
ones which
uh you do in order to impress people and
use a lot of weight so like when
powerlifters set up for their lifts
they're purposefully trying to get their
technique to be mechanically advantaged
so they can lift more weight but if you
lift at a mechanical disadvantage
assuming that the muscle that you want
to target is being targeted it's
actually really great because the
external load is minimized and the
internal load is just as high and you're
winning on all fronts
yeah great question
what
i'm going to do tyler really quick
tyler asks hey dr mike finding it hard
to know my mv for a new meso
pumps are great but soreness isn't
really there
should i increase sets or write it out i
think if you're getting good pumps and
especially if the strength stays stable
over multiple weeks you're at md or
above
mv should get you very very low pumps
soreness is absolutely not a
prerequisite for mv so you're good on
that ground
all right next question is from
nom nom nom nom ah
i love reading these names
can you do a behind the scenes episode
of rp what's coming up in the near
future with rp what kind of lambos are
you going to get i'll actually answer
these right now
this is a behind the scenes episode of
rp because literally rp ceo nick shaw is
here
uh what's coming up in the near future
with rp so here's the thing
um we generally don't like to talk about
that for a couple of reasons
one
is if you talk about stuff that's coming
up but the development and engineering
timelines are always dynamic
it's really tough when
the off chance that you miss your
deadline people are like what the fuck
and then you're like
it makes you look bad
you feel like you're letting people down
it's like it's like talking too much
shit like before like before like a
second date you're like man i'm about to
you know you texting her up and she's
like oh yeah and you're like oh i'm
gonna and she's like and then you get
there you're like tada i have erectile
dysfunction
which is a typical date for me
um
so what we like to do is just work
really hard on awesome projects and then
just release them so that the near
future is kind of now and then you don't
have to fuck with anything but we're
always always always working on new shit
i will tell you that
um and then what kind of lambo are you
gonna get uh i mean the problem i don't
mean to be pediatric but the proper way
to phrase that question is when is what
kind of new another lambo are you going
to get because i've already have 19
maybe 20 lambos now well honestly i
don't even count them the butlers take
care of the butler's buy on the but
let's pay for them out of their own
pockets
yeah
yeah yeah
summit omg summit so we're doing a
summit in las vegas in mid-december and
it's going to be all over our site and
all that stuff and i'll be posting it
about it on my social media rp strength
social media for sure so adobe strength
and instagram and it's going to be like
an in-person live lecture series uh like
day
of like technical lectures by myself
melissa davis james hoffman mr nick shaw
yes
and uh you know their shit is going to
be like stuff that you learn about
my shit is gonna be like awful stand-up
comedy where you're like why does this
guy just shut the fuck up and you're
gonna ask for a refund it's gonna be
great so um think about coming to the
summit vegas is great you can do all
kinds of crazy things few spots for the
team full rom we're gonna do like a live
in-person training oh that's right yes
that'll that'll probably sell out really
quick so it'll be a team full rom
live in person
technique and hard training workshop in
las vegas and right after we're going to
go to the casino and we're going to
spend it all baby
all right
all right
all right mr shaw thank you so much
you hit me with your wedding
ring are we married now
um
first uh
first wedding night all right
that was fun i didn't get fired yet it
was probably like hey mike after this
come see me
here's your paperwork
steven uscetta asks is it possible to
main gain for only a year
how do i tell when it's time to bulk or
cut
am i considered a beginner if i've been
off and on training for a year or two
but i've only started to take it
seriously recently
is it possible to maintain or gain for
only a year in your situation almost
certainly
how do i tell when it's time to bulk or
cut i'll say like when the gains start
being like you do an entire mesocycle
and someone's like hey did you get
stronger last month and you're like
i don't know
and someone's like did you get bigger
like do you notice changes in your body
over the last month and you're like
maybe
then it's time to either bulk or cut and
you decide to buy bulking or cutting
there's a lot of it's just personal
preference but if you're on the fluffier
side for your own personal preference
cut first then bulk
if you're pretty lean and shredded and
you're just like or like harry potter
type skinny then bulk first
so yeah best of luck to you man i think
you're in for some really good games
okie dokie
cashews 1000 says good evening agent 47
uh scott is that that uh what's that
who's agent 47
the hitman guy is like a fifth my
fucking size i wouldn't even bat a
fucking eye slapping his dumb ass out of
fucking earth orbit the fuck up out of
here goddammit stupid ball thing
god oh oh oh an alarm that says
aha oh yeah reminder to myself folks
this is going to be really promo-y
and awfully corporate but i'll cut to
the chase
right now on the rp site
just through this weekend it's a holiday
in the united states called labor day
and uh
labor day 30 code on all digital
products on the rp site gets you 30 off
of all digital products so like the
custom training templates where you
build your own shit
and it uh gets you jacked that's like a
hundred bucks and it'll just be like 70.
so if you want to get in there and buy
shit
buy it up if you don't no worries
um we'll just learn shit for free okay
so
next up is
ashletosh
gondor
he says hi dr m love from india we'll
love back to you i've been to indian
twice hopefully we'll be going back at
some point
i forgive you for reading my name oh
well yeah i have actually i have a
russian name that's also impossible to
pronounce and the way we all pronounce
my last name including me is technically
wrong so i have all the respect and
world for that
all right uh oshitosh asks training for
boxing beginner nine months to comp
ooh nine months before a competition wow
god damn
best of luck first of all
what would be a good plan for
hypertrophy and endurance for that sport
how to periodize for the competition
so the first person to go to is your
boxing coach who's going to have the
best possible plan for you
what i would say is
most of the endurance work should come
from boxing and drilling some can come
from ancillary methods
and for hypertrophy
i would just focus on getting
a pretty jacked upper body and then a
strong upper body your pushing
musculature is probably most
determinative for your boxing ability so
if you can increase your close grip
bench and your incline bench by a
considerable amount over that time then
you're just gonna punch motherfuckers
harder and uh
they're gonna get hurt
dude best of luck man and uh
swing away do you guys remember the
movie signs with mel gibson and uh
joaquin fucking phoenix
scott
i want you guys to get to know scott a
little bit better scott's a youtube
video guy here he is a he's a filmmaker
creator himself and is thus a very
astute uh critic of film and he loves
these great actors that are all
invariably heroin addicts
[Music]
isn't that not true
name a an actor you like that's not a
heroin addict
i can't name a single one heath ledger
whatever they're called the heroin takes
all the best
and um
yeah that whole swing away thing if you
guys know what i'm talking about you
know what i'll talk about but uh he was
supposed to be uh uh joaquin phoenix was
supposed to be a professional baseball
player in that movie and boy oh boy does
that body composition and anthropometry
not match
i've said enough possibly too much
at some point there's an off weird
chance that i get super famous i'm going
to be sitting in an award show next to
joaquin and he was like hey i watched
your video about me i'll be like
you know it's all for for money man i
didn't mean anything he's like oh really
you think i have the physique for
baseball playing no god damn it stop
doing heroin fuck
all right
ger
gerferna is that an emmer r n a j for
not
always been skinny with a bigger belly i
have trained six months now good
beginner gains want to start cut any
tips
or info on visceral fat the primary
determinant of uh what kind of fat you
lose when you do a fat loss diet is your
genetics
but where you put it on is generally
where you lose it as well
so
just get nice and lean and your belly
will
shrink in size notably now interesting
enough for me i have like a
very loose abdominal wall or a lot of
organs or something my salamic cavity is
large
so i can actually make a big gut
anytime i want even when i'm ultra lean
like right now i have veins in my abs
but i can look pregnant no problem that
might be your case you might actually
not have a lot of visceral fat i've been
dexa scanned like a trillion times and
i've like essentially trace visceral fat
when i'm down at com competition levels
but i can still make a belly so make
sure that it's um you really do have a
lot of visceral fat because that might
not be the case but uh listen if you've
trained for six months all of your best
gains are ahead of you and you're gonna
be able to seriously alter your physique
so so keep it up
all right
oscar
says
hey dr mike someone who's recently
turned 18
congratulations i can now legally make
fun of you in a bunch of ways that would
be illegal if you were younger
little bitch i'm just kidding you know
we're making fun now
i'm curious if there's anything special
about nutrition in regards to bulking
and cutting which teens should keep in
mind motherfucker you a grown-ass man
now teen you can join the military
haven't found info on it i mean so i'll
tell you this
don't go too hard in the cutting
direction don't starve yourself
because as a person of your age your
brain specifically is still growing and
maturing and developing you're becoming
smarter every several weeks definitely
and i just wouldn't do anything to risk
that you're also probably maturing
physically as well you are likely to
still continue to grow in height if you
do an extreme contest diet you can
actually prevent yourself from reaching
your maximum adult height so i would say
if you're cutting just cut down enough
until where you like feel pretty hungry
and kind of tired all the time and then
stop don't ever go into extreme bullshit
and as far as bulking just take it easy
and bulk measurably don't get super fat
because you have to deal with that later
and and the last thing i will say is
if you're young just eat plenty of
protein multiple meals a day great
tasting food stay healthy train with
weights and really enjoy the fuck out of
yourself if you know if you're being
safe and responsible and your friends go
i don't know what country you're from
sure as hell looks like
i don't know i have no idea if you're in
a country in which drinking is legal at
18. go out with your friends and have
fun you know what i'm saying like live
life and um don't don't get overly
hardcore early the vast majority of
people that i've ever interacted with
that got way too hardcore way too soon
just burn out of the fucking sport and
they become diddly dick in the end um
when i was 18 years old i was training
consistently and eating well but i
wasn't super concerned with like real
like bulking cutting
over the top kind of crazy stuff and i
encourage you to have fun with it um
once your games start to slow down a
little bit
when you're like 25 years old or
something and you're already really
fucking mega jacked
then you can ask yourself the question
of is it incrementally worth more of my
time to really get more fine-tuned with
this or am i cool just kind of living
the life and then you can answer that
question when you get there i just
wouldn't get overly uh
overly focused on the crazy details just
for now but uh happy birthday uh if you
recently turned 18.
all right
brian compton asks any tips to emphasize
the fastest medialis thank you for being
you oh well
you'll have to thank my parents for that
one
i think it's the specific positions they
used are we really talking am i really
talking about my parents doing it
gross
something to think about
is every single one of you
on this chat right now your parents did
it
they did it
to completion
i think that you you're falling asleep
tonight you think about that
don't do that all right
vastus medialis
it is by no means clear to me that there
is any
large body of convincing research that
you can preferentially target any part
of the quad versus another to a
meaningful extent
there is some reasoning
that if you take a wider stance and your
point chose a little bit more out any
exercise that does that
you can target the inner part of your
quads
if you have a closer stance and you
point your toes a little bit more
straight maybe targets more of the outer
i can't say i'm ultra convinced by that
i'd say i don't i'm not sure
so i would just say get overall big
quads and that should probably do you
good
i wish i had better advice and when
there's convincing research
that certain positioning targets certain
parts of the muscle i will absolutely
report it for example it's pretty pretty
well known that overhead pre-lengthened
versions of tricep exercises do target
this back part of your tricep called the
long head so that's like a thing we know
if you asked any tips to you know
increase my upper pack size i would say
a variety of incline pressing that angle
probably worked well in klein flies but
um for the quads g-whiz you know they um
even if you look at the sort of the
ultra structure of the quads just from a
biomechanical perspective it doesn't
even seem like
it could be possible to target
different parts of the quads maybe
there's something to it but not not
super convincing
ooh all right
some online project
asks um
at renaissance puristation what impacts
has jim simons had on dr mike
when uh mr nick shaw and i were doing
personal training in new york city
we would uh talk to all of the hedge
fund people we trained we trained a
bunch um actually um
have trained people that are worth
hundreds of millions of dollars it's
weird to be around them the first few
times because you're just like
holy fuck
and then after a few times you're like
this is a regular person who just has a
preposterous amount of money they're all
super smart and super diligent um but
you know i would ask him as we got to
new york like 2008 2009
it was just after the financial crisis
so some of them were reeling
and uh you know we were asking about
economic principles finance hedge fund
stuff and a lot of them would say well
you know like no one could have survived
xyz well unless you're a red tech unless
you're in tech and we're like what the
fuck is red tech and looked it up in his
renaissance technologies is the hedge
fund that jim simons
who is a brilliant
is i believe is brilliant mathematician
former military code breaker
and he decided he had had absolutely
enough with guessing stocks and picking
uh stuff like that using heuristics and
just went straight for mathematical
analysis is probably she started uh the
fund called renaissance technologies
which is really the the first core
quantitative fund um and i have a ton of
respect for for jim simons i don't know
him personally but uh he's he's a just a
peak baller hood i think he's worth like
12 billion
so you know what i'm saying um
if i'm in an elevator with him i'm
blushing the entire time is what i'm
trying to say
hardcore like anime blushing
scott watches a lot of anime he knows
what i'm talking about
all right
next question is from sharif
randhawa
sharif randhawa
hi dr mike i'm building a home gym my
man
i have a decent budget but i'm limited
by space i could probably fit about five
machines
would be your top picks
machine and brand
uh
right
so i'll tell you a couple general
principles that you think will guide you
better than machine and brand one do not
pick machines that typically only do one
thing if you don't have to
so
for example
um the atlantis
hack squat slash leg press selectorized
combo is amazing because it's two
machines in one it can just be a hack
squat or a leg press like we can occupy
for its footprint both
on the other hand the atlantis lateral
raise machine is not something i would
get unless i had a lot of space because
it just does one thing which is lateral
raises
a free motion machine
absolutely critical it's just like free
motion
fuck it's called free motion universal
trainer or something like that it's like
every single cable thing you could
possibly do on one machine that is worth
its fucking weight in gold definitely a
power rack
if you're into the kind of bullshit i
purchase for training we're into a good
high quality like cybex ion series smith
machine might be worth it but if you
have a rack and you like the free
weights that's great of course a
dumbbell set is a good idea and
those are all the for sure ones and then
case-by-case basis
try to pick machines that have a bit
more
application than just one exercise at a
time
best of luck to your home gym i hope it
turns out really well
all right matthew
schweins
clearly a french name i have no idea
what the fuck i'm doing
asks mike thoughts on the olympia this
year who takes it i got my guy nick
so many insane competitors though cannot
wait um
you know i don't know i'm not like a
really big prognosticator
on uh
systems over which i have no deep
insight and i don't have any deep
insight
um
the smart money on a technical level is
on big rami
because the olympia if you look at it
from a historical perspective
if you just bet on the guy who won last
year to win again you're making a lot of
money
if you bet on the upset consistently you
lose almost all of your money
so when big romney the problem with big
romney is that you see pictures of him
and you see pictures of nick walker and
you go oh my god
you see big grimy in real life standing
next nick walker and you go oh my
fucking god
because he's like five inches taller
and on stage 40 pounds heavier
and has straight up better aesthetics
and comes in at least as lean
if big ramy continues to come in the
kind of shape that he's been in the last
two years
man it's just real hard to knock him off
um
big romney
now of course if he comes in off and
somebody else comes in like fucking
crazy yeah
for sure he's gonna lose
but uh yeah i think uh knowing almost
nothing about the particulars of smart
money smart money moderately
above
mentally unwell money which is how i put
my money big rami
great question
uh okay edward smith
asks
what is the best exercise for building
the lower and middle pecs
um
i don't think a best exercise exists but
there is a group of exercises which are
all really good some of them are going
to fit your body better some of them
you'll use for a while and they'll be
really great have a great stimulus low
fatigue and then they get stale on you
and you'll have to trade them off but i
would say barbell bench pressing with a
proper arch retraction
dumbbell pressing
flat dumbbell pressing is a really good
idea
and all sorts of wider grip dips
and wide grip weighted deficit push-ups
and some machine presses that allow you
to go beyond
your body position for the stretch are
awesome awesome ideas and of course
flies again when you do the flies arch
your back a little retract shoulder
blades and voila
pex galore if you're looking at more
exercise ideas
hypertrophy hub on renaissance
periodization just just google
hypertrophy hub israel
that's how i spell my name out
phonetically in my head when i type
i never made it through a few grades of
school
and uh
there's going to be a huge guide for
pecs
for chest and it's going to have tons of
exercises and even at video links and
the video links have technical
descriptions so get that look
uh scott's video guy how are we doing
everything fine
so far so good
all right
next up
akshay anvikar
any tips on hypertrophy for my little
willy
so
i
this is really weird to admit in public
but i have a weird medical condition
in which my uh my genitals just never
grew to beyond when i was like age two
so it looks like like like the end of
the pinky here
little winky
so it's like you know like when you
start off
behind far enough on a race
you just don't even run the shit so i
have no idea how to make anything bigger
in that realm because uh
just off to the worst possible fucking
start
but i honestly think from a theoretical
perspective
progressive organized systematic
masturbation program
it's gotta do something
at the very least at least make it nice
and calloused
best of luck sir
all right oh hey
hey youtube skipped 80 trillion
questions again
excellent
let's see if i get the right one
all right
okay
oh wait we scroll sorry folks
whoa
uh-oh scott the video guy i can't scroll
up anymore
what was the last one you did
okay
yeah let's answer this guy real quick
okay
bruce wilkie
asks i have no colon ileostomy and
carnival works amazing i cannot digest
roughage without pee blockages meat
digests immediately without issues i
know you have thoughts on carnivore
i'm obese and i'm losing weight and i'm
still lifting strong lifts down 50
pounds what advice do you have my first
advice is to make sure that any diet you
are consuming is corroborated by and
approved by your uh probably two people
one your primary physician and to the
gentleman that did the surgery for you
that's absolutely critical because
you're in a post-surgical state you may
have some very very different
nutritional recommendations requirements
that you have to meet but i will say on
top of that whatever seems to work for
your body absolutely do that and as long
as you're getting improper nutrition i
wouldn't worry about any kind of like oh
would you have to eat roughage on
average yes veggies are great but if due
to medical condition you're unable to
consume them
then maybe you are a candidate for a
fiber supplement but already i'm outside
of my scope because medical nutrition is
really serious it's something medical
doctors
and rds need to do so say is i wouldn't
worry too much
about checking some weird boxes about
what the average person needs as long as
it's working for you and your medical
team says it's totally good to go and
you're probably not in line for any sort
of nutrient deficiencies i think you're
awesome and i'm really glad that you're
having um
you're having success with your lifting
and you feel great so hopefully that
keeps going
mike we skipped three
oh okey-doke can you go back anymore
let's find out
is
gin pee one of them
i'll get nathaniel i do see him
what about will murray brian
i see those okay great
uh let me see if gin p
oh i see okay i think we're scrolled
back okay great i hope all right
oh hold on uh jose sanchez says no
questions but feel free to dm feet pics
check your dms my friend
though i will throw an occasional
starfish in there and i don't mean the
sea the sea loving animal
i mean well you know what i mean let's
not get kicked off youtube check your
dms sir
nathaniel thomas
says hi sir i have a herniated disc but
i still want to reach a 500-pound dollar
for a 400-pound squat finally however
i'm not sure i can keep powerlifting
with this injury flaring up every three
months any advice
nathaniel i have one piece of decent
advice for you as i hope is decent
do everything you have to over the
period of months if not years
to get that injury completely
asymptomatic or the most asymptomatic it
can be
check in with rehabilitative specialists
physical therapists sports medicine
doctors to make sure that they clear you
for hard training so all the exercises
that hurt it don't do them
all the exercises that overload your
back and your legs in a safe effective
manner that does not irritate the injury
do them i've had i do have a herniated
disc there's a part of my ass i actually
can't feel to the touch because those
nerves are all fucked now
it's terrible is ever
i'm not gonna get into my fetishes now
you guys can fill in the blanks you're
all perverted
so um just get fucking healthy bro
and as you're building your legs and
your back with exercises that are not
probably as accurately loading or as a
bending or rounding of the spine as they
could be eventually
you're going to be building the
foundation for these lifts and then when
you're nice and healed very
with an unbelievable attention to almost
flawless technique start to thread in
heavier versions of squats of deadlifts
and try to get heavier
great fatigue management don't overdo it
and i'll tell you one last thing do not
ever fucking grind a rep that you don't
think you can make or that will require
any any substitution of shitty technique
for damn your ideal technique other
motherfuckers can afford it you can't
because one little move from you and
you'll be back in the fucking saddle
again with hurt back um and hopefully
all this works out for you but place
your health ahead of your short-term
fitness goals because your short-term
fitness goals lie in a foundation of
amazing health and if you take that away
this doesn't fucking matter
yeah
scott you're looking at me for a second
what are you doing
just making sure we get everybody super
we definitely want to answer everyone's
question folks
will murray asks
thank you for all your work any thoughts
oh my pleasure thank you so much
any thought on training on him
oh
this question's so fucking amazing hold
on
oh i just farted i hope you guys don't
smell that oh again and again oh shit
scott's video guys in the room with me
scott cheers
all right
um any thoughts on training on a micro
dose of lsd or
psilocybin
that's mushrooms for all of you folks
not in the know
uh feel it gives me increased focus on
mind muscle connection
uh
yeah people say a lot of great stuff
about microdosing these things i don't
know what the long-term health
repercussions are or other stuff
so
unfortunately i don't know about that
if it is actually sustainable from a
health perspective or even enhancing
then i don't see any huge downsides with
it um microdosing shouldn't interfere
with gastric motility which high dose of
mushrooms absolutely will people don't
typically like
get an acid and mushrooms and eat a lot
um but that's megadosing
um so
if you feel that it works for you it
might not be bad although others i don't
know how many studies there are on
long-term outcomes with stuff like that
um
maybe it works
yeah careful driving your car around
drugs or drugs i never do i've actually
never done acid i've done mushrooms lots
of times and i've never microdosed a
single time megadose or go home i say
and it did actually go on purpose to a
gym one time after i was pecan mushrooms
it's a weird place the lights are so
bright
and uh i forgot but people do like the
they'll stare at you like in a
confrontational manner because they're
in the middle of a very confrontational
thing and like this one guy turned
around after a set of dumbbells and i
was just in the gym like
and he like looked at me and i was like
he had a mean face i tried to lift i
tried to curl the 15 pound dumbbells it
was the heaviest thing i felt in my
entire fucking life what a disaster so
hopefully your shit is better than mine
on that end
all right
brian d'ambra says hey dr mike i started
working out in earnest and dieting in
the last year or so your playlists have
been a
real gd useful for starting well thank
you so much and thank you for not
swearing better to not swear i say
any tips for hamstring engagement
that's they're a problem for me
make sure that when you're practicing
your good mornings and stuff like a
deadlifts that you're tilting your hips
appropriately getting an anterior pelvic
tilt go slow keep your chest up and get
a massive hamstring stretch keeping your
knee not like this but like this the
entire time
if you have hamstring machines various
leg curls i would say try to put some
padding into them so that you get a
nasty stretch in the bottom
that nasty stretch is everything go
through a full range of motion and try a
variety of different rep ranges and if
you have trouble engaging sometimes just
doing more sets gets you all the work
you need and over time your engagement
will improve
so uh yeah best of luck brian i hope it
works out
all right
did you hear that scott's favorite guy
i think he's charged
all right
guergeli blasco
my question how to manage the training
and diet if somebody catches an illness
for example
the covid at the middle of a mesocycle
how long so yes very good question i
would say if you have systemic system
symptoms like uh fever or malaise or
very low energy i would say no training
until you'll feel pretty damn good and
then do
at least half a week of very easy
training like
deload training that'll make you feel a
lot better when you're back to pretty
much full health start a new meza cycle
brand new could be the same structure as
the old one and then very low volumes
low intensities three or four reps in
reserve
two to three sets on exercises
and then slowly work up from there
i wish i had better news i wish i was
kind of hack so we just go crazy
training right after but unfortunately
that's not the reality
all right foxfox
when one fox is not enough
says i have a question for dr mike i've
got an
artesian well on my property and the
water pressure is lousy
any suggestions
yes
uh one easy suggestion
what i would do
is
you drill down at a roughly 45 degree
angle to about 500 meters below the
repository for the well
and insert like a three or four kiloton
nuclear device
um
neutron bomb to minimize radiation and
just
all sorts of stuff is going to come out
of that well water
radiation
dirt with radiation on it strontium 90
it's going to be great but no more well
pressure problems
yeah nuclear weapons can solve so many
great things
if you guys ever want to go down a nerd
rabbit hole because tbh
i was a nerd way longer uh way way long
ago before i was ever a lifter
uh you guys want to go down a
nerd rabbit hole
look at some of the proposals made in
the 50s and 60s
both in the western nations united
states uk etc and a lot of really wacky
ones from the soviet union about using
nuclear weapons for um
geoengineering purposes like so for
example if you have like a uh
like a three mile stretch of land
between two lakes and you want to
connect them that's like a preposterous
the expensive super long dig in order to
get like some kind of river going
between them but if you line some
nuclear mines
you know five mines one kiloton each
between the shit you go like this just
automatic river with almost no
investment so there's all these like
really really zany ideas about how to
use nukes for engineering the problem is
the radiation if there was no radiation
we'd be doing that shit now but god damn
does that shit suck so it's kind of cool
kind of a cool thing
all right steven uscetta asks
how much cardio is too much priority is
building muscle but i get serious doms
every time i train legs
but want to train cardio so that i can
go hiking kilimanjaro and other
mountains planned whoa holy shit
um best of luck
so how much cardio is too much it's just
it's really like this
you
have a certain rate of gain that you're
going to get with no cardio
with a little bit of cardio your rate of
gains is probably going to be just just
a tiny bit higher
from the better nutrient
flow
from being able to stay leaner from
having a better work capacity for better
workouts
and then just after that
any more cardio that you add the rate of
gains will start to decline
and then at some point it'll be no gains
and at some point it'll be muscle loss
the thing is because you're very
familiar with the typical rate of gains
that you experience
you will be able to titrate your cardio
to get the level of gains that you want
based on your baseline so if you know
like typically have great workouts and
typically you can add up five pounds
here and there every you know a few
months to your lifts or every few weeks
know that
and then do like whatever cardio that
you think is a little bit more than
you're doing now like increase your
cardio by 25 or 50 volume intensity
whatever it is
and over the course of the next
mesocycle see how it goes if it's a
great meso and just blast all your leg
share out the water hey sweet uh
increase again right and then at some
point you'll be like
you're going to feel the cardio so much
your legs are physically going to be
tired and you're going to have multiple
times when you go to the gym in a messy
cycle where you're going to be like time
to train legs
uh
and you're going to warm up you're like
fucking weak this is terrible my legs
are beat up from the cardio and you're
going to realize okay this is untenable
i need to do less but because you
started a certain level of cardio and
you expanded a certain amount now you
have this bandwidth that you understand
the topography of and you can say okay
this is too much this was not enough i'm
going to go here and i'm going to get
great gains in both respects or anywhere
between here for the trade-off you're
looking for another thing i would say is
as your trip to kilimanjaro or wherever
um you plan on going and you know
getting killed by natives and then you
get on a national geographic mystery
documentary hopefully it doesn't happen
but uh always a possibility
uh as you get closer to the event do
more cardio and
invest less in your weightlifting or
your weight training and then
temporarily you'll have maybe even a
month or two of no gains in your lifting
movements
and remember that all the muscle if you
lose any muscle it's all temporary it
comes back no problem when you pull back
the cardio and increase the food and
weights later but in those month or two
before you can ramp your cardio like
fucking wild and just still maintain
everything you have and then you're
going to be unbelievably proficient at
hiking
when it comes time to do it and then
when it comes time to get back into the
groove and start putting on muscle on
your legs again then you can switch
those gears so not only is there that
titration element but there's also a
timing element and that more or less
described all of modern periodization at
the same time so give that some thought
best of luck in uh all of your mountains
i've summoned uh scott's video how many
times have you filmed me personally
summit k2 unassisted with no oxygen
oh man i lost count we stopped counting
after 19 times
i once drove a lamborghini up to k2
that's a tough drive
the the rear wheel drive
we got the four-wheel drive model but
then i was like fuck it let's do this
rear wheel we got it done more of a
challenge yeah
it's just too easy out here fellas
that's the problem
all right
next up is naveed sgs
how to deload on peds running for cycle
but i got strong too fast and i'm
feeling the effects i'd like to keep it
as short as possible
so first thing don't keep it as short as
possible
if you keep it as short as possible you
end up having a crude micro trauma to
your tendons and you'll snap your shit
up later keep the deal of the same as
always one week
on average
and on peds i would say that because
there is a tendency to want to
amelia ameliorate the effects of your
connective tissues not getting strong
enough fast enough
versus your muscles
i would say you take the standard d load
and you can just do that that's totally
cool but also take the standard deload
and make everything 50 lighter than
normal it's very very easy
like three days a week versus your
typical six
fifty percent sets fifty percent load
fifty percent reps every session
rest eat relax sleep the rest of the
time you're gonna feel amazing come back
ease back in
it's easy to get on a shitload of gear
you just go ah
boom pack comes off ease in let the gear
do the work under the hood you do high
quality progressive training as if
you're not on gear that the auto
regulation takes care of everything so
if you're on gear you'll be able to add
a few more sets here and there add a
little bit more load here and there take
your time and do it right go slow um the
idea and we have direct youtube videos
on this
but the idea that
training on gear and training
natty is different is
mostly wrong there are a couple of
nuanced distinctions which are really
just not pertinent in most cases and
also
it's an interesting thing on social
media where there's a demand for videos
like that
because
natty motherfuckers always curious about
the shit
um and geared motherfuckers are always
like yeah man i'm like no i'm fucking
special bro i'm like a superhero nothing
applies to me anymore it's all different
man which is fucking wrong
and from a creator perspective
people who make videos
want to talk about stuff and maximize or
exaggerate all the differences so it's
really is very little difference but the
thing with gear is that you have this
ability to get super strong super fast
you can sort of outrun your body uh and
then you it becomes unsafe because you
can get hurt so i would say if anything
your training on gear should be more
conservative
and i promise you'll get just as big and
by just as big i mean bigger
good question
all right anton bjork
no relation to the artist i assume
eating above calories during diet but
only protein
eating only protein is almost impossible
good luck with that
there is a hypothesis of something
called rabbit hunger rabbit starvation
where people eat a ton of protein
over their maintenance calories but they
still lose weight and fat
as far as i know in the lab that has
never been demonstrated
so uh
it's quirky
and it probably won't work
but if you want to try it for science
i can't say you have my blessing because
i don't want you to fucking keel over
me get sued but
uh i would just i would just do a more
conventional approach because it's just
uh for the effort that you're putting in
it's just more likely to work out well
for you
yeah
good luck man
all right
mino levon
says hi there i started a new mezzo
cycle for the first month
is upper lower split
day
1 lower 39 cents day 2 upper 36 sets day
3 lower 33 cents total
day 4 upper 24 cents day 5 another lower
no
sets for that effort is 50 to 75 and the
rest is 45 seconds
uh i would say that looks fine
but what you could do is significantly
reduce the sets maybe by half
and increase the effort
level relative effort although i think
effort by that you mean intensity 50 75
is fine yeah as far as percent 1rm
i would say decrease the number of sets
and increase the number of
seconds you take for rest maybe double
that
make sure that you're not out of breath
before your next set and you might be
able to get a more efficient program
going
all right
so hey dr mike i'm a huge fan six foot
six excellent i love jokes like that
i'm flexible enough to ask to grass
squat but i get super fatigued after as
few as three sets should i find a
different exercise uh or just aim for
good sfr on the squat i think you could
do both i think you could work on your
sfr on the squat but at the same time
maybe invest in some leg pressing or
some hack squatting and save the squats
for later so maybe like do
three or four sets or however might need
on a hack squat or a leg press something
that doesn't beat you up as much
and then do two or three or four sets on
the squat afterwards you'll need less
weight you'll get to practice your
technique well and your
work capacity won't be limited much but
i'll also say it depends on what you
mean by super fatigue because i get
super fatigued from one set of squats
and i often throw up after two
so sometimes it just comes with a
territory but
take that under advisement
all right
fox
20 rps
hey mike will rp ever have a pt
certification course most courses suck
though if there are any good courses let
me know i have all the answers you are
looking for
i have all the answers you are looking
for
do you guys think jedi's ever do the
jedi mind trick but don't say anything
like run up to like a stormtrooper he's
like ah oh i pushed the gun you were
like
he's like
just stands there like yeah
you stupid motherfucker he's like i'm a
stupid motherfucker like oh i didn't
mean to say it out loud god damn it all
right get out of here he just leaves
day in the life i shouldn't be a jedi
too much power
how wow
instantly go to the dark side
will rp ever have a pt certification
course yes
hopefully within the next two years
this is a course that we will begin
working on creating
hopefully in the next two months
most courses suck agreed
if there are any good ones let me know
the meadow henselmans has a pt course
that's probably really fucking good
because meta almost never puts out
anything that's not really fucking good
so give that one a look
all right birdman i'm a huge fan of your
wrap mr bird man
my hips are uneven from scoliosis
when squatting heavy my path isn't
perfectly straight but curves out
laterally to one side any thoughts i
would say have a sports medicine doc
look at that and tell you if it's gonna
be deleterious to your joint health and
if not i think it's totally fine and if
your path up isn't perfectly straight
but curves laterally to one side i think
you can squat in front of a mirror for a
while and probably correct that to some
extent and maybe it'll be okay
all right
all right
never lose your nerd
says thanks for the input keep up the
great work oh thanks man i'm trying
we're trying
all right dreamer sweet name
beginner two months into full body
workout three times a week six feet tall
27 years old
20 to 22 percent
ish body fat should i diet for
maintenance and get newbie
gains or
cut
i would say two months into uh i'll tell
you i'll skip to my lou on this one
one whole year default when you start
maintain and just fucking eat food don't
worry about your body weight or just
maintain it and just train hard and
you're fucking in the clear after a year
you can decide whether or not the ball
can come
and uh i will say it would be helpful
you provided a lot of information which
is great
uh a dick pic would really just seal the
fucking deal i would really be able to
tell you what to do in many respects not
just in training like you know holy shit
you should get into porn or holy shit
you should really tell girls before shit
happens that you got like a condition
that's what i do i'm just kidding i've
never met a girl
my wife and i have an arranged marriage
all right
ryan
hollier
it says here your message was retracted
please please please
try asking again we don't want to leave
you hanging my friend
all right
gin because
says hey dr mike stoked for the upcoming
nutrition class
i assume certification
amazing
it's going to be gargantuan
they actually have a video of our
nutrition cert walking through a major
megalopolis just
one fucking skyscraper
this is gonna be too loud for that it's
gonna be too loud isn't it
[Music]
like that
but with a skyscraper
it was worth it
um is it safe to assume the higher level
courses will be offered in the future
yes
not in the one to two year future but in
the two year plus future definitely
they're all um
theorized and sort of like we have a
list of courses we potentially offer
we just want to do a really high quality
job with the first cert and we're not
trying to money grab this fucking shit
be like hey like
you know cert one's released three
months later
cert two three and four advanced certain
dildo sir dildo sir that's a good idea
and yes great you said is in the
comments advertising his cookbook
my man
the real greg get that shit greg sell
that fucking book
fucking awesome
and has a real lamborghini
she does maybe several
unbelievable all right uh post show okay
sorry yes so yes we will uh have high
quality added courses in the future and
if you have the cert course as a base
course there'll be a huge discount for
those so look for those but we just want
to do a good job we don't want a money
grab i like when i said money grab and
greg just sets in the comments pimping
out is cookbooking that's hilarious um
and
post show recovery still going well 2 18
as of this morning your videos have been
ridiculously helpful thanks dude thank
you so much man um i'm glad post show
recovery is going well for you
i've done many shows in which that was
not the case for me if you would have
asked me after many of my shows house
post show recovery going it'd be like
fuck do you think it's going i don't
know i just asked look at me i don't
know you ugly as usual
so
awesome awesome thank you so much for
signing up for the circles by the way
hopefully we don't let you down
um all right
persistent question here from
poi
loyk
i like very very jewish
thoughts on the meta-analysis saying
that frequency doesn't matter if volume
is equated and that there's minimal
benefit of going over 10 sets per week
per muscle uh it's largely correct for
the kind of population they were
studying which is just generally
beginners
as you become more advanced
first of all volume equating hides the
fact that you can double your volume
with an appropriately high frequency and
get a lot more benefit
um and then you can go over ten cents
per muscle especially as an advanced
individual especially with a higher
frequency
so
yeah volume equation
is great when you're doing theoretical
work or trying to understand how
training works
it is not great when you go into the
real world and try to figure out oh like
you don't have to equate your volume
it's kind of a saying like um
the performance dynamics
of a high-class mercedes uh sedan and a
lamborghini are roughly the same at 80
miles an hour like sweet that's cool i
would expect that but what about 180
well the merc doesn't do that and then
lambo has great handling at 180 so
you guys like that brought that back to
lambos shit y'all motherfuckers know
what's on my mind
the lambos are back there we never shoot
in their direction
let's keep something clear here scott we
never shoot at our vehicles
the bulletproof lambo which we may or
may not be in possession of jeremiah
hey which one of your lambos is
bulletproof doctor mike wouldn't you
like to know i got assassination
attempts left and right i'm dodging the
shit you guys like how i'm doing a
jiu jitsu choke blocking for that i
assume assassination attempts for me
will be in the form of jiu jitsu
attackers
i've never done jiu jitsu in real life
it's all a scam
all right zach
says hey mike i'm brand new to lifting
at 25 years old i'm horribly weak and
have bad joints
zach you're not fucking horribly weak
don't say that kind of shit you're 100
fine
we all have different strengths
and have bad joints particularly loose
elbow and knee ligament
i thought you were going to say
something a lot worse that's not that
bad
even at low weights for example at 20
pound dumbbell curl my joints hurt after
all my sets
how to mitigate
so i would say do weights that are even
lower
in which your joints don't hurt
and slowly work up over time and you'll
probably have a situation in which
eventually you're doing 30 pounds and
your joints feel great
low weights are all insanely arbitrary
and very individual what is a low weight
for someone could be a very high weight
for someone else
like you know i'm saying i don't take my
grandma to the gym and say hey grandma
here's a 200 pound squats easy for me
you should be able to do it for two
reasons one it could kill her
two my grandma's actually fucking
immortal and all she did was this and
all of the
the iron atoms and the weight
de-atomized and
and just were gone i don't even know
where there's a mass energy conservation
i have no idea what's going on grandma
she's got the raiden eyes and shit
lightning everywhere
that's the last time i took grandma to
the gym
bitch lightning ark killed some random
girl on the squat rack
in any case
zack just go at your own pace man and uh
comparing yourself to others is cool
until it's not
just choose the weights that are
appropriate for you and they could be
like
really not a lot of weight and stupid
meatheads could see at the gym be like
look at that motherfucker curling ten
pounds fuck him but they go home and cry
a lot and probably unemployed whereas
you're probably a real sharp guy with a
bright future so fuck
yeah and if you think you have some sort
of particular uh
condition where your joints are
particularly prone to disruption
something to go see a sports medicine
doctor about
best of luck to you men
all right alex p says sup mike have a
nice weekend hey thanks alex p you too
man you too i'm trying to have a nice
weekend but mr nick shaw's visiting
right now
as nice of a weekend as we can at a
corporate level
don't laugh that loud scott's video guy
he can hear us he can always hear
always hear
always here
ingrata
asks can we ask sarm's questions here
technically yes but i know nothing about
sarms i've read almost nothing about
sarm since about 2010
and uh i've never taken sarms and until
they have a much better risk
to reward to risk profile i won't ever
fuck with them so there's probably
better people to ask about sometimes
than me man a real talk just uh
just just being real
all right
okay lulu and dodo
excellent excellent name
hey dr mike thank you for all the
information you provided you're my
favorite youtuber which fitness youtube
channel do you recommend
fitness youtube channel
renaissance periodization
[Applause]
um you know so stronger by science does
a nice fireside chat and they're uh
they're mega nerd to a level that uh
even uh
tickles my nerd willy so to speak so i
would i would check them out and uh
preposterously don't have a ton of
subscribers and they should have more
and uh
let's see who else is doing good stuff
there's tons of folks that's the first
that comes to mind i'm blaking
um
mr jeffrey nippert is two things one an
excellent youtuber and also so handsome
and he a lot of times i just put him on
mute watch him talk away into the night
i don't just watch i'll tell you that
my hands are not just on the phone
ipad
you guys get the drift scott am i
missing anyone i i talk about other
people constantly
chad
yes i don't know how productive they are
juggernaut training systems is great i
don't know how many videos they're
releasing nowadays they still think it's
some i will say though juggernaut
training systems for training strength
athletes and sport athletes like athlete
athletes not us idiots that go to the
gym and do this uh dominant the dominant
channel for that sort of thing so i'd
say check that out that's really good
yeah
yeah and they have so much content
backlogged from years ago it's still
super relevant that like you can watch
that shit for forever
learn a ton of stuff
eugene
eugene teo which again has the jeff
nippert effect of being
very knowledgeable and his hair alone
my god
now let me just make something
completely
completely clear
if you took
an arrow that was made by nanotech
engineering to be perfectly straight
your boy is even straighter than that
shit but if eugene teo was like yo
what's up i'd be like it was up if you
know what i'm saying if you catch my
drift
not even remotely straight
all right
here we go
40 ounce oracle incredible name
says so you mean to tell me those hedge
fund weenies you trained didn't gift you
a lambo
they didn't gift me anything
um
yeah
yeah
they were great and they weren't weenies
some of them were strong as fuck and we
sure made them stronger
you know it could be like uh crate uh in
a news article like
attempted stabbing of hedge fund manager
turns to shit when he stabs the other
guy and watches him die actually one of
the hedge fund managers we trained was a
pretty high ranked in jiu jitsu
and i was like you just don't beat my
ass and he's like you better train me
good or i fucking will
he beat me up i cried and cried
making it no different than any other
night of course
all right anthony
bass
any relation to mr lance bass
scott is that a backstreet boy or an
nsync member or a
98 degrees person yes
okay all the above potentially none
how important
anthony asks is d more carbs less fats
for both hypertrophy and strength
training as long as calories and protein
are in check
not vary unless you get to very extreme
ends so if you eat too little fat to
keep your hormones in check
that
you start to pay some nasty dividends
if you eat um
super low carb and ultra high fat your
training energy will suck your insulin
dynamics will suck
so as long as you're getting like enough
carbs to have like great pumps and great
energy and enough fats to well if lack
of a better term keep your dick hard
then you're good to go and it's really
minor differences like all of us talk
about the super specific carb protein
fat
um
trade-offs because like a bunch of times
you come from a perspective of what
you're doing and what the kind of side
of the industry you're involved in and
like a lot of the stuff myself jared and
charlie do was like super geared to
ultra high-end competitive bodybuilders
like i aspire to be the person that
about bodybuilding nutrition and
training can cover everyone's bases no
matter how advanced a bodybuilder they
are so a lot of the time my brain is on
that end and i don't know like i'm just
a motherfucker trying to get jacked
and for motherfuckers just trying to get
jacked and you'll get really jacked
before this shit matters just eat plenty
of protein plenty of fats and you'll be
totally cold
all right
areg asks is dragon ball an inspiration
for you to be technically
technically speaking technically correct
dragon ball z is
dragon ball
is a terrible cartoon made as a sick
joke other than the pervert stuff
involving balmo which is sweet
um
dragon ball z
the first time i ever saw dragon ball z
i thought this is the most poorly
animated show i've ever seen in my life
they'd barely even tried this is awful
fuck the japanese entirely
the second time i saw it the first time
i was like 13 or 14. the second time i
saw it i was like 14 or 15 and i
actually watched it for a little and i
believe the string of episodes i first
saw then was when piccolo fused with
nail
and uh ascended to uh you know class one
super namek or whatever
and uh
it changed my entire life
straight up i couldn't believe when he
comes out of that cloud of dust with
like the atomic orbital shit i couldn't
say anything to anyone for like 10
minutes after i was just like
and
my in huge fraction of my involvement in
weight training a combat sport is based
on dragon ball z
and if you said hey mike any wish you
want
like
will grant you right now any wish
dragon ball z powers are in a very short
list of five wishes
like
number one's probably like
society reaches the singularity and i
get to see it happen
number two is like i get dragon ball z
powers
um yeah huge huge and don't start with
me motherfuckers are you anime
motherfuckers i'm kidding
every time i say i like dragon ball z
you know where this is going scott's
video guy some motherfucker in the
comments like oh yeah
well you should watch naruto
i'm a grown ass man i can't be watching
shit eight-year-olds watching
motherfucker the fbi is gonna flag my
ass for watching that shit as well they
should what kind of grown adult watches
that shit
videos of him going to school and
what am i gonna watch sailor moon next
alone
maybe
jk naruto seems pretty fucking baller
anyway that's a long-winded answer for a
question
harley
pocklington if that's not the most
british ancestry name i've ever seen
asks can i train with broken femur
oh my god
optimally upper body only certainly not
optimally but you can probably do a good
job i will say depending on the time
course of your recovery from broken
femur
must must must check with hopefully your
surgeon
and your medical doctor primary medical
doctor
about um
can you train your upper body hard
specify to them the following
feel free to write this down if you like
but this will be recorded and will be
replayed so you can just go back and
record it
if they don't know what that means
tell them that you are going to be
inducing
transiently very high systolic and
diastolic blood pressures
and those are always systemic
heavy lifting that does not evolve the
legs try to say that in as many ways as
you can so they understand the gravity
of the problem so to speak and then they
can render a decent decision about yes
no or actually when we take another scan
on your leg three months later we'll let
you know if that's not a good idea it is
because some of the broken femur stuff
once they reconstruct whatever the fuck
you broke down there and however many
pieces um some
the time course after surgery is very
touch and go and at some points after
surgery a very high blood pressure
elevation can actually start to damage
some of the structures and put you back
or actually risk uh like some thrombotic
events really really crazy shit you
don't want to fuck with that's why when
they're like hey don't do anything hard
for two weeks after surgery they mean
that shit this is life and death so i
don't want to tell you yeah go fucking
lift because it might not be on the
table but if your doctor's clear you you
absolutely can just use mostly machines
and position yourself for upper body
movements and i think you should be good
to go yeah but uh must must must be
cleared by a medical profession
your medical professional not just some
guy on the internet there's not even a
medical professional
all right we did another skip scott the
video guy
bear with me folks as i scroll up
forever on youtube
okay gram c
fuck
fuck
this is bullshit bro
this is awful
i can only go back up to
tommy stiletto
tammy stiletto
fuck
should i read them
how the fuck are you seeing them i'm not
should i close the pop-up window or
something
i have a different view i have to like
verify where they're at
you can't i'm off the chat mine messed
up
this is awful
what yeah how many questions do we miss
fuck
is there a way i can bring this up on my
own screen
and by me bring up i mean you bring up
because i'm
terrible at technology sorry folks we're
experiencing technical difficulties hey
is this your first time on the youtube
camera
oh no you've been in some mirror shots
before
isn't scott good looking
we always have this weird professional
uh
distance shall i say
then i'll probably close super chat
because it's 5 30
yes
i'll just answer from this then yeah
okay
whoa
the whoa oh
so actually
oh these are the they go up right scott
thank fuck i thought we missed a
shitload of them all right
okay we're back
graham c asks hey uh hi dr mike any tips
for wider buys and tries wider
interesting my arms look skinny from the
front
but are pretty big in the front bicep
post thanks you know almost all of that
is just going to be genetics
try a variety of exercises and to the
extent that you are able the arms are
just going to get big like they're going
to get big i wish there was a good
answer but unfortunately
i think the 95 correct answer is just
get bigger
yeah
all right
deku says dr mike my sexy overlord my
right biceps tendons
tend to get very aggravated during any
sorts of curls within three sets
do you have any recommendations lengthen
position tends to upset them the most so
the first thing is unfortunately try to
avoid the lengthen position second is
do some very very light lifting sets of
like 20 reps 10 reps in reserve
in the lengthen position after your main
biceps training to try to build up some
tolerance to that position and over time
you'll probably find that the length of
position hurts less and less or doesn't
hurt at all and then you can start to
gear up into the heavier weights and
everything will go much better so that's
my best advice
and also do stuff like underhand chin
ups and underhand assisted
pull-ups and uh underhand pull-downs and
i think you'll get a lot of bicep
stimulus that way as well
by the way i trained legs earlier today
you guys might have caught that shit on
insta holy fucking shit i've been
sitting here for like two hours an hour
and a half
you're like you've been sitting for a
while after leg workout and then you
like try to move your legs you're like
oh oh god
like if there's a fake and you're in a
plane and they're like the plane's
crashing prepare to like run off the
plane when it crashes we're just gonna
do a wild landing we're like i'm gonna
die there's no way to get up
so
anyway just sharing a little bit of my
life with you
lindsay
hello
question
dr mike i'm doing a very basic push pull
legs program and i'm still progressing
well but am i missing out on not running
a more methodical training program
so yes absolutely more methodical
programs almost always yield some
fraction higher training output than a
less methodical program but
what i would
ask you to try lindsay is to
look at the
degree of methodicalness
i believe the scientific term is
meta-ethical immunity
as a spectrum
from i go in and i lift the weight
to i'm a fucking nerd scientist like dr
mike or some stupid shit like that
person with no friends
friends no friends
and
rate of gains is going to be whatever it
is
and if you're ever like oh i wonder if
getting more methodical is going to
improve my rate of gains
add one layer of methodicalness
so try to maybe get to the point where
you're like okay i'm training everything
three times a week which is sweet or
twice a week let's say
i know theoretically that some of my
muscles recover way faster than others
so my biceps i know i could probably
train three times a week instead of two
and theoretically it'd be better because
they're always kind of like chilling and
not really ever being pushed hard most
the days of the week
but then try to take your biceps just to
three days a week training and change
nothing else and if you get like over
the next couple of months you're like
holy fuck if this really worked try it
with your side belts try it with your
calves try it with whatever and then
that way as you become
interested in trading off a little bit
more effort a little bit more
nuance a little bit more sort of
perseverance in the details for a little
bit more hypertrophy or strength gains
you'll be able to sort of uncork that as
you want it's kind of like um you have
like a drink in front of you and you're
like should i drink this or not well the
answer is not like either
drink at all or just like not drink it
at all and push it off the table the
answer's like well if you're a little
bit thirsty you can have a gulp and
they're not thirsty anymore you put it
away
like that give that some time
i'm gonna have to get all the backup mic
too
chris
it is yeah
should i just take it out or i'll leave
it
just turn it off
just leave it
do a better job or you're fine
good help nowadays
cool we're good we're still live yep
am i in your ears
you can hear me yeah
but can you see me yes
yeah you see yeah
all right
one of the best names i've ever seen in
all of social media
slavic boar
you know i used to be a member of a
member's only sex club and that's what
they called me
hey doc i'm around 15 body fat right now
and i was wondering if it is smart to do
a main gaming phase
where i eat at maintenance and let my
body
use stored body fat until i get to
around 12 to 13 body fat unless you're a
beginner in your first year or two of
training i would advise against that
it could work or you could just stay at
50 body fat forever
um you will continue to gain muscle at a
very slow rate if you maintain but a
much faster rate if you purposefully cut
down to like 10 percentage and then
mass gain up to 15 and repeat that cycle
over and over with occasional
maintenance phases to reduce fatigue
that's probably not a good idea to do
the main gaining unless you're a
beginner
or unless you're aggregate
jk jk mr greg
all right
nathaniel thomas thank you so much for
your generous donation by the way if you
have a question
we're all ears
mike
canis
i have anytime i read a name by the way
i always toggle between american
pronunciation of the name and russian
pronunciation
because some of the names are just
better to pronounce in the russian
especially eastern european names as you
would expect
okay
quit training 2014 to 2019 35 pounds
overweight now and i want to regain
2014's lbm 2020 i tried to cut one
percent body weight
one percent per week but lbm was low
gave up and got fat should i try slower
cut this time or try to recon pre-comp
just get back into the swing of things
and train hard for a while not super
hard just incrementally harder over time
in a way that is sustainable for you eat
good food eat healthy have some snacks
here and there but after literally a
year of that you're going to gain a
shitload of muscle lose a shitload of
fat anyway and then
go at half a percent per week for 12
weeks or so lose some fat
do a massing phase gain some muscle and
some fat repeat that over and over not
only will after a few years you regain
all of your lbm you lost you'll probably
gain even more so that's probably my
best advice
all right eric tim with an extra m at
the end of his last name excellent
asks how useful flash necessary is it to
vary exercises for example
is the coochie clapper 3000
leg adduction exercise something i
should incorporate
exercise variation should occur on an as
needed basis
and there's fundamentally sort of two
classes of need one is you're just
trying to do some shit that's different
you want to target your adductors more
than they have been
and the bad girl machine
good girl it depends on your sociology
of course uh but the adductor machine
is something you could see as a
potential decent candidate exercise and
then you use right the other thing
is
yo scott can you turn that shit off i
don't want to hear that idiot rambling
it's me again
the other reason to switch exercises is
because of staleness and stainless is
when the exercise starts to give you
worse pumps and worse soreness and mind
muscle connection sucks your joint pain
gets a little worse you know again this
exercise sucks and psychologically you
don't want to do it anymore you want
something different so generally
exercises start out pretty good stimulus
to fatigue ratio and stainless drags it
down over time
technically the relationship in a
hypertrophy book is described better
it's more like this when it gets down to
here you might want to replace it with
another exercise for the same muscle
group like barbell bench to dumbbell
bench and every three or four months
your dumbbell bench gets pretty stale
replaced with barbell bench and then it
gets pretty stale and you continue to
cycle through like that so is it
necessary to change exercises yes
but the frequency of it will be
determined by how your stimulus to
fatigue ratio on that exercise is
feeling and if there are other good
candidate exercises you want to try to
replace it with that have a better
stimulus to fatigue ratio and it's an
easy test if you're like man benching
sucks i'm fucking done with benching try
like deficit push-ups and the first
workout you do with them you're like oh
my fucking god my pecs are blowing up
and my shoulders feel great amazing you
do that until it doesn't feel amazing
probably a few months and then you
switch to another exercise that targets
the same muscle that's how i train all
the time it's been uh the way i've
trained for gee who is like fucking
decade plus now at the very least it
works it fucking works
tammy ask a question it just didn't come
through
so it's on the top right thanks youtube
yeah
scott this isn't tammy's question this
is a picture of your balls
pretty good where that came from
gee whiz mister oh boy
tammy asks how many
there's some plays in there
how many said
should i be doing in the gym each day
five times a week sets maybe
too seriously
recomp and get that superhero physique
i'm 160 pounds was 125 few years ago i
hit a wall i feel you on that tammy
so
tammy get over to
get to the google machine and type in
hypertrophy hub
rp
hypertrophy hub muscle or something and
one of the first hits probably the first
is going to be a hypertrophy
hub central guide for all of the muscle
groups and it has recommendations for
every single muscle group for how many
sets roughly to start out with how to
progress how much weight to use and
that's going to take care of all of your
in-depth question nothing i can tell you
right now will will remotely be a great
answer to that
in addition to that
if you get an rp custom training
template
from renaissance periodization website
it's a hundred bucks literally this
weekend it's 70 bucks because there's a
30 off sale if you use labor day 30 as
your code when you check out you can get
the custom training template pick all
the muscle groups you want to train and
it'll just do all the work for you so
you just pick all of your favorite
exercises and then once you do that you
just get in and
do all the stuff you rate the
exercises and how they make you feel it
changes all of your sets and weights for
you and then it just takes care of
everything and each one of these comes
with a six week program that you can
repeat kind of ad infinitum if you want
and it's going to take care of
everything another thing i'll say is
if you hit a wall and you're not in the
best place body wise for where you want
to be don't worry about superhero
physique just yet just get into a stable
training pattern do really well eat
really well your body is going to start
to change slowly and over time you know
some muscle gain phases and fat loss
phases some maintenance some more fat
loss and muscle gain you're going to
look better and better and better and
better if you want guidance with that
hey top sell the fuck out of you but
here we go team full rom forum on
facebook just join that shit it costs a
little bit of money it's like 30 bucks a
month we can guide you every fucking
step of the process and actually send
you the workouts you get them
automatically pre-made for you all the
exercises are selected do you want to
get in on that that's great if you want
to do it by yourself no problem so
you've got some free options you got
some paid options and remember that it's
the long view that gives you the
superhero body i am once also aspired to
look like a superhero but it turns out i
just ended up being a russian james bond
villain
not a lot of a lot of gear
i've never seen anyone in a james bond
movie look like this i'm still pissed
about the agent 47 bullshit how dare you
i can't fit into a suit
in any case best of luck to you tammy
okay
uh
blekke blake thank you so much for your
kind donation please ask a question
all right leland massaro says
formerly morbidly obese
my loose skin abs love handles but
overall body holds a good amount of
water i'm in the same place
suggestions on pulling water when
peeking
taking trt only as needed no diuretics
it depends
but
i would talk to your coach
and something i would tell your coach is
you say nobody told me this but i heard
that aldactone has worked for some
people when safely prescribed by a
doctor and monitored
that's all i'll say
but without acting you can also do the
same thing you just have to cut more
water than everyone else if you have
more water when you're peeking
you just drink less water instead of
like a day out you start two or even
three days out control your water intake
to a smaller level and it's just gonna
take you more days to dry out but every
day you're going to wake up the holy
fucking shit i'm drying out even more i
thought i was dry before my last show
and then i continued to dry out and i
was like oh my fuck i just kept going
and i just kept drying dryer dryer on
the night show jared looked at me
because there's no mirrors backstage and
i was like i don't know man i don't know
how i feel he's like dude fuck and then
all the pictures are like oh holy shit
we drive the fuck out so it just takes
longer in many cases
best of luck man i hope that uh
the water thing sucks i fought her for
years no knowing nothing
all right
all right carter on the asks see that's
the russian pronunciation
okay it's better than catriona which i
don't know maybe that's her name and
then i'm sorry i pronounced it russian
like
hey mike
thanks for the great content as always
it was my pleasure
even in a small or moderate deficit i
often wake up hungry in the middle of
the night advice yeah so
take some kind of uh casey and shake
especially or casey and pudding or even
a thing of greek yogurt and when you
wake up hunger in the middle of the
night have it in the fridge ready to go
chow it down super quick and then go
back to sleep uh if you're the kind of
person
who
can go back to sleep easy after eating
something like that then it's gonna work
out well for you well we'll say i guess
it's kind of a self-selling probability
if you currently wake up already in the
middle of the night hungry eating
something is almost certainly going to
be able to put you back to sleep better
than eating nothing so give that a shot
i think it'll work out well just
whatever macros you have for the day
take out the protein and whatever other
matters you need for that mostly protein
out of your daily diet put it into that
midnight meal throw it in the fridge or
whatever and then and then do your thing
yeah um another thing is like if you
have some like fair life or some kind of
other like
kroger brand super low carb milk you can
have that and we can actually do is
get over to your fridge
pour yourself a glass of milk
uh i'm gonna say it throw it in the
microwave and i was whatever heat it up
however like however every lake i do the
microwave and then stir it up heat it up
again and then you have a nice glass of
warm milk that'll put your ass back to
sleep in a traditional way so give that
some thought i've done all that kind of
stuff before another thing to consider
is egg whites you can make yourself a
bowl of egg whites and throw them in the
fridge and uh they're super easy to eat
you just go
go to sleep you don't have to chew them
really and uh they hold in the fridge
super well and
yeah they're essentially all protein
yup i've been there man
uh
best of luck
steven
says serious question but sounds super
silly
i'm poor
i have been there my friend and morally
i'm still poor
scott the video guy is morally destitute
he morally he's in debt actually i will
say
negatively rich
my 5 30 a.m gym pre-workout is coffee i
happen to have lots of smarties
six grams of dextrose val value or
invalid
uh i think it's great i think it's great
yeah super fast adjusting carbs coffee
is one of the best pre-workouts there is
and on a price performance basis
absolutely the best um bro yeah do it up
that sounds great
all right
ahan shankwakar
amazing name and i love every time
every time you ask a question it's
always great can we just appreciate
ahan says how fitting of a last name the
video guy is it's like scott was made
for this job
he wasn't just made he was engineered
there's a laboratory on uh
corellia
yeah you guys the star wars fans will
know where that is uh scott was grown in
a petri dish to be the ultimate video
guy
by accident he turned out to also be a
pervert
but uh
no love lost as far as the fbi is
concerned so the fun continues
video is not the only job
they say video killed the radio star
scott hoon killed the radio star in fact
he's killed many radio stars usually in
their showers blood splatters you know
that whole thing all right
next up is i'm
tesla biatch
excellent name
43 years old been lifting for a few
years wondering what the best way to get
the way i look with a pump after upper
body day thanks
continue to get bigger over time
continue to get leaner on average over
time through various fat loss periods
and then like maybe one or two
three years from now
you're gonna always look like you have a
pump
when you're lean
and
bigger you just always look like you
have a pump like right now i'm pretty
lean and pretty big for what i usually
am if i walk around and i see a picture
of myself uh like my wife took or
something i'm like holy fuck shit did i
just do a workout but like no i'm just
like
you know i'm at the stage so yeah and
also creatine if you take creatine you
always have kind of a half pump
all right legolas has a question
actually a few all right i am 37 years
old 180 centimeters
244 pounds god damn
want to get to 180 190
get bigger i'm just kidding
goal is fat loss and get healthier i'm
new to strength training doing twice a
week continue my question in the next
super chat all right
i find doing one meal a day
lets me stay in a calorie deficit that
is causing muscle loss on non-training
days interfering with muscle gain on
training days yes and that's correct
i picked up doing cardio for the last
three months usually 30 to 40 minutes of
spin biking three times a week maybe 40
minutes of brisk walking five times a
week thank you dr mike yeah i would try
legolas for best results to eat three
meals a day they don't all have to be
big you can still eat one big meal a day
and have like maybe like a casein
protein shake for the other two meals or
like a bar or something or just some
lean meat with some um
i noticed you're paying in australian
currency you guys have like the best
food in the world the highest fuck
quality ever so it should be pretty easy
to find that stuff i really do think
that one meal a day will get you lean
but you will sacrifice lean body mass to
get down there three
even three meals a day is going to have
a bigger impact so so give that some
thought
and best of luck man
all right ahan shankwakar back again
says dr mike ever since i read your
books and started utilizing scientific
concepts like med mrvm et cetera i've
been making way more gains but also no
longer get laid so thanks here's the
thing about getting laid
it's fun it's fun but afterwards the
yapping
what do you want what are we
what are you thinking about
do you like want to have kids
which is why i never do these things
just kidding i've tried to get laid
numerous times i have no game
come up to a girl and she's like
what do you want and i'm like
and i just run away every single time
you guys have some advice about how to
talk to uh
even the same sex opposite sex any sex
uh let me know i'd like some sex please
and i feel you though
desi says i can't lift heavy oh by the
way han thank you so much for the kind
words about the uh getting the progress
from science hell yeah science get me
laid science
i believe in you when you get me laid
i can't lift heavy due to a brain injury
that sucks
most content is on heavy lifting can you
recommend a rep range sets to still see
some gains without lifting heavy
so i will say this i don't know what the
limits are so you have to must must must
talk to your doctor
and make sure this is okay
but with higher repetitions
especially if you don't do the valsalva
maneuver
if you don't strain like that you can
keep very low blood pressures
by lifting even in the 40 to 50 rep
range as long as you get a burn in the
target muscle and keep going through a
little bit of that burn and do more sets
than usual but stay a little bit further
from failure five reps for failure you
can get some really really good results
lifting like that
and uh
yeah does he i hope i hope biotech
advances enough in the next
five to 15 years to
i just straight up kill your ass up she
become a fucking monster and be like oh
i was missing this heavy lifting sucks
just be thankful you'd have to lift
heavy blows i did it earlier today
fucked up
all right
last question for the day
mr scott the video guy all right uh this
is a self-refreshing screen yes so this
no but i refreshed that's
it
never lose your nerd
never lose your nerd thank you so much
for your insane level of activity this
chat today is humbling
should i prioritize traps as its own
exercise or work it in with shoulders or
what would you suggest it depends on how
much
two things how responsive are your traps
to extra work and how interested in big
traps are you
what i would say is this here's how i
would start
do all your shoulder work and at the end
of all of your shoulder work every time
you do a shoulder session just do like
some dedicated trap work like
two to four sets of trap shit just like
lightweight really squeeze really like
lower and see how that works and if you
like where that's going integrate more
trap training if that's good enough and
your traps are too big already fuck it
and um
if you don't like it and it's stupid and
it's a waste of your time just stop
doing it i will say
that every time i prioritize my traps
the last several years with like shrugs
and stuff they grow and then every time
i take away all shrugging and just do
normal super on laterals and all this
bullshit they never shrink so trap
maintenance volume is something that for
many people
can be
checked
with just shoulder and back work and
deadlifts and all that stuff
so you can go through gaining periods
where you do extra trap work but then
you do zero trap work much or all of
your trap
size is gonna stick around and that's
like a cool thing um
that i think is really awesome to know
because a lot of people say like oh i
train my traps and they get bigger do i
have to keep fucking training they're
super annoying for them to stay big and
the answer is probably not if you do
like decent job training your back your
shoulders and some compound pulling for
your legs so that's it
awesome questions folks
thank you so much
um
i'll straight up say this if you guys
didn't have awesome questions to ask me
i wouldn't be doing this because but
fuck would alive be without good
questions and
up here reading
you know children's books or some stupid
shit nobody likes
yeah
yeah all right shall we close it off
shall i sign off folks thank you so much
for tuning in we'll make another
announcement on youtube when we have
another one of these lives
if they keep going this well we'll keep
doing them every uh i don't know a week
or two week or three something like that
and uh folks have a great weekend
namaste and we'll see you next time
you
