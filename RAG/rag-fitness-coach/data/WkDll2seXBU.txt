this one honestly blows my mind because
it's been a top selling product for
a good 10 years or so it has over 22 000
amazon reviews at four and a half stars
and yet if you just logically dissect
the label most of what you're getting
here is going to be totally useless
what's up guys sean aldawani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today we are taking a trip
right down to the very bottom of the
freaking barrel
the absolute worst of the worst when it
comes to pre-workout supplements
uh it's honestly very rare to find
pre-workouts that are genuinely well
formulated these days the
vast majority of them are i would say
extremely mediocre at best since
supplement companies know that the
average consumer out there is really
just responding to the marketing behind
the product and not the actual
ingredient profile
and so most pre-workouts available are
just very
for lack of a better word some of them
are a bit worse and then a special
select few like the ones i'll be showing
you today are
so bad and so flat out insulting that
it's genuinely painful to
observe so let's jump right into it and
i'm going to put these in order
going from number five and steadily
decreasing all the way down
to the absolute most depressing
pre-workout in existence at least as far
as i'm aware and as always guys
aside from just the general
entertainment value remember that the
underlying purpose here is always to
educate and to provide you with actual
useful information and so the breakdowns
that i give here while they might sound
a little bit
savage at times you are going to get
practical value from this to help you
save money and improve the results you
get from your supplementation plan all
right number five
on the list of worst pre-workouts is
sculpt nation
pre-workout
it seems like pretty much everything
v-shred touches turns to
and supplements are definitely no
exception sculpt nation uh proudly
boasts one of the most
ridiculous downright comical supplement
lines on the market right now they've
got
a wide variety of completely worthless
products you can check out if you enjoy
flushing your money down the toilet
including testosterone boosters growth
hormone boosters
nighttime fat burners bcaas obscenely
overpriced creatine
and of course this gem of a pre-workout
where literally
every single ingredient aside from the
caffeine is criminally under-dosed to
the point of having
no benefits whatsoever you get 100
milligrams of l-tyrosine
as opposed to the bare minimum 500
milligrams you'd probably need to get
any effect at all
solid ingredient for increasing energy
and focus but you need more like
probably a thousand milligrams as a
minimum pre-workout dose
you get 100 milligrams of betaine
whereas the proper clinical dose is
upwards of 2000 milligrams so
uh 1 20th of the proper amount 1.2 grams
of beta-alanine when
the minimum efficacious dose is usually
considered to be 3.2 grams
uh 2 grams would be the absolute minimum
and also keep in mind that both betaine
and beta alanine are not pre-workout
ingredients in the first place
because they have no immediate effects
on performance okay those are compounds
you take every single day
and the timing really doesn't matter and
betaine is kind of a debatable
ingredient as well
there's 1.5 grams of l-citrulline
another solid ingredient
but it's roughly half of the amount
you'd need to see any legitimate
benefits
and then three grams of bcaas which will
have no effect at all on your training
performance
or on anything else for that matter so
at the end of the day what v-snake
v-shred is really offering you here is a
37
bottle of flavored caffeine this
genuinely is one of the very worst
pre-workouts i have ever seen
all right next up number four on the
list we have pre-workout explosion by
six star nutrition
uh which is a supplement line owned by
muscletech and as far as i can tell this
is basically like their
sort of cheap walmart brand of products
that they use to target the
uh less fitness savvy crowd let's say
and just like with sculpt nation
the only useful pre-workout ingredient
that you're truly getting here
is caffeine there's 1.5 grams of
beta-alanine
versus the proper 3.2 to 6.4 gram
clinical dose
1.5 grams of creatine versus the proper
3 to 5 gram dose
1 gram of l-arginine which isn't going
to have any pre-workout benefits to
begin with because
most of that l-arginine doesn't even
make it to the bloodstream and instead
it's used up
by the intestines for energy not to
mention that the research study dose is
usually 3 grams minimum
after that is the quote unquote advanced
pump complex
which is a proprietary blend of 500
milligrams in total
from a combination of taurine citrulline
citrulline malate and more l-arginine
so that 500 milligrams is roughly uh oh
i'd say to be generous
probably like five to ten percent of
what you'd actually need
in order for all of those ingredients to
meet their absolute minimum
doses so that's just pure label
decoration it won't have even the
slightest benefit
when it comes to improving strength or
energy or anything else
and then lastly you get a micro dose of
l-tyrosine and choline
which won't have any effect whatsoever
because it's just not enough
and to top it off you get a modest dose
of 135 milligrams of caffeine
so that's really the only ingredient
here that's going to do anything at all
for you and actually i just noticed that
they do recommend up to two scoops of
this which doubles all of the dosages
but even with everything doubled it
still doesn't change anything that's how
bad this formula is to begin with
it would bump the beta alanine and
creatine up to three grams each
which is a minimum proper dose for those
but again those ingredients have no
acute effects they're compounds that you
take every single day
and the benefits slowly build up over
time so they really don't have any place
in a pre-workout to begin with all right
counting down number three on the list
we've got
joel seidman now if you spend any amount
of time watching joel's training footage
over on youtube or instagram
it's very clear to see that joel's one
of those guys
yeah you've seen his stuff right the
whole ridiculous functional train
he's a person he's not a powdered drink
mix
wait what are we talking about here
again the worst workouts i've ever seen
workouts supplements
right okay number three on the list of
worst pre-workout supplements
we've got equate which actually is a
straight-up walmart brand and
uh if you asked me to envision what a
walmart pre-workout would look like
this would be it look at this dude
wait till you see the oh no
no no no oh
this is actually kind of similar to the
previous one except at roughly half the
dose because they only recommend taking
one scoop so it's 1.5 grams of
beta-alanine
1.5 grams of creatine 1 gram of bcaas
half a gram of l-citrulline and half a
gram of l-arginine very
very sad indeed again beta-alanine and
creatine are not pre-workout ingredients
to begin with
and those are half doses anyway there's
no need for pre-workout bcaas and
the usual dose would be probably bare
minimum five grams anyway
l-citrulline you'd need at least three
grams arginine is useless and that's a
useless dose anyway
so there is roughly a zero percent
chance that any of those ingredients
will noticeably benefit you
physically mentally emotionally or
spiritually
in any way whatsoever and then of course
they just toss in some caffeine at the
end 135 milligrams
which is a pretty modest dose but if you
are reasonably sensitive
to caffeine then that should still give
you a small kick so
all in all uh this is pretty close to as
bad as it gets but not quite
uh it does in fact get worse and from
one of the biggest supplement brands in
the world for that matter by the way if

all right at number two we've got amino
energy by optimum nutrition
[Music]
this one honestly blows my mind because
it's been a top selling product for
a good 10 years or so it has over 22 000
amazon reviews at four and a half stars
and yet if you just logically dissect
the label most of what you're getting
here is going to be totally useless you
get a 5 gram
amino blend which you don't even need in
the first place because there's no
necessity for
isolated pre-workout amino acids if you
just ate some kind of reasonable protein
source within a few hours of your
session
and even if you didn't even if you are
trying to train mostly fasted and you
wanted some eaas in your system before
the workout
you still wouldn't want to go with this
particular product and that's because
you don't even know what you're getting
here
since all the specific dosages are
hidden behind a proprietary blend
and in a proprietary blend the
ingredients are always listed from
highest to lowest dose and surprise
surprise
the most prominent ingredient is
l-taurine which supplement companies
very often used as a filler because it's
a dirt cheap amino acid and it's also
tasteless
so it's really really easy to flavor so
without seeing the specific dosages
for all you know this could be 4.9 grams
of l-tyrosine and then
everything else could just be pixie
dusted with a microscopic amount and
that really wouldn't surprise me at all
because if you're genuinely dosing your
products correctly then you would want
people to see that you wouldn't want to
hide it that would make no sense so the
only reason to use a proprietary blend
is precisely because you don't want
people to see the actual doses that
you're using
and at five grams total even if you took
two scoops of this and got 10 grams
it still wouldn't be anywhere near
enough to distribute across all those
different ingredients to where you'd
actually be getting solid usable doses
leucine beta-alanine citrulline
isoleucine valine tyrosine there isn't
nearly enough total ingredient volume to
go around what you're really getting
here is this
100 milligrams of caffeine or 200
milligrams if you take
two scoops that's really all this is in
terms of what will actually directly
benefit you and that will give you a
boost in overall energy and performance
and that's why people will still think
this is a good product
they take it they feel the caffeine
working and then they attribute those
effects to
the entire formula as a whole without
realizing that everything they're
experiencing is just from that simple
caffeine buzz
and that also applies to the previous
three pre-workouts as well that's why
you can have a formula with
eight completely worthless totally
under-dosed ingredients
that are not doing anything at all yet
you're still gonna have people raving
about how awesome the product is
purely because of the caffeine that's
included plus the placebo effect on top
of that
train harder than the last time all
right we finally made it i'm glad to see
that you're still here with me
uh as traumatizing as the labels on
those pre-workouts have been
but we're gonna get through this one
more to go brace yourself it's time to
reveal
the single worst pre-workout product i
have ever personally seen
in my entire life drumroll
redleaf pre-workout energizer
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
now decent chance you've never even
heard of this one but it is listed as an
amazon's choice product and it does have
uh around 1700 views with 4.4 stars so
there are a lot of people out there
buying this and apparently a lot of
people who are very strongly subject to
the placebo effect
now why is this number one on the list
well with
the previous four products even though
every single ingredient
is either ineffective under dosed or
both
they still at least give you an
effective dose of caffeine so that the
product will still have
some legitimate benefit whereas with red
red leaf
the entire ingredient list from top to
bottom including the caffeine
is going to be completely and totally
useless one gram of l-glutamine
pointless ingredient and even more
pointless dose one gram of beta-alanine
versus the minimum 3.2 grams
half a gram of l-arginine no benefit
whatsoever
1 gram of bcaas which is next to nothing
and of course
bcaas aren't useful in a pre-workout
anyway for some reason they throw in a
tiny dose of cranberry extract i have no
idea what the reason for that is
tiny non-usable dose of green tea 50
milligrams of raspberry ketones which
were heavily promoted as a
weight loss miracle several years back
completely useless and this is a minimal
dose anyway
and then you do get the standard
caffeine which is usually the
saving grace that at least makes the
product helpful to some extent
but in this case you're only getting 40
milligrams if you're
hyper hyper sensitive to caffeine then
you might feel that to some small degree
but for the vast majority of people as
far as improving training performance or
giving you any sort of significant boost
in energy
that's just not going to be enough so
this product here is a perfect testament
to the power of the placebo effect
you've got all these people
raving about how much they love the
product when in reality there isn't a
single efficacious ingredient in this
entire formula this is why you cannot
trust anecdotal reports when it comes to
supplements
or even most training and nutrition
anecdotes as well the placebo effect is
just
too much of a factor most people don't
have the fitness knowledge or the
experience to
really be able to suss things out in
terms of what's truly working and what's
not
and particularly when it comes to
supplements concrete objective research
should be the primary factor that you're
using
in order to guide your decisions hope
