oh
[Music]
hey youtube let me introduce today's
cast
jared
charlie
jew
juji mufu
also my name is mike
right hello hi
gigi mufu is going to be doing a team
full rom rp strength hypertrophy leg
session which includes the hames
and the koidz the dennis koids as they
are called and um
he is going to be having his technique
troubleshot
in the stiff legged deadlift because
coach jerry over here thinks he can
coach anyone he once told me he woke me
up in the middle of night shaking me and
he said mike i can coach the whole world
i can do it would you hear it i believe
you i was so scared but i got better at
technique so
after the stiff legged deadlift on which
gigi's going to be coached on he's going
to be doing leg press for just a small
number of reps maybe 20 or so for
multiple sets upon which you'll probably
throw out blood swallow said blood and
begin doing smith machine squats if he's
still alive by then it'll be a fun
workout charlie and i will be in the mix
and i'll be doing some
leg curls instead of stiff legged
deadlifts
because stuff like you know it's very
hard and
i'm taking the easy way out really smart
i'm not going to lie training at all so
i get it
at all charlie's going to mail in his
reps uh when you're this big everything
looks hard so juju you're the only one
really training today how does that make
you feel
uh
shit
sweet let's get to it
[Music]
varsity close to your shins you're
pushing your hips more more more
there you go and as you're pushing the
hips back now think about touching your
ass to the upper corner of the room so
going down back back and up
more back
try to touch that floor you said you're
flexible
it's just the first rep jared
who who coaches the first rep of the
first jared
thing of the workout
we got to make it we got to make it
perfect you said you get shit out of it
so mr jujimufu
told our technique expert at rp
not one of them i guess
that he can't get his hamstrings hit
from stiff legged deadlifts
mr jared feather ifbb pro took that
personally michael jordan's style and
he's going to be coaching juji through
his
many many modifications to make him feel
his hands and get super super sore and
grow from stiff legged deadlifts check
out all these cues if you have trouble
feeling your hands if you have trouble
with this stuff like that technique this
is gonna be a fucking sweet segment for
you also charlie's in it doing the most
perfect stiff leg deadlift in the world
so that's a good reference frame and
actually i think juji's technique is
gonna be really fucking good um
me i'm doing leg curls cause
your boy's a little beach i was just
like oh my bank just kidding i've been
programmed for an entire mezzo to do leg
curls that's my excuse what's your
excuse brothers
let's get to it
oh wait ahoy ahoy
let the knees come forward
chest pass up ass up s up asshole
the fuck yeah keep going
mess up
bar close the whole time far closer as
your hips go backwards
old sound carlson something just has to
happen here
i'm sorry guys it just feels like a
stretch it's supposed to yeah okay does
it hurt it just feels like i'm
stretching that's great that's all it's
going to feel like then you're going to
get crazy delayed onset soreness
tomorrow and it'll be hypertrophy yeah
yeah
what are you trying to feel
is that if you had a torn hamstring
would you be able to do this
i don't think so right that's good i
like that
that's actually a pretty good uh uh a
little tool for
interesting
no i could not do this without a torn
hamstring well full credit to one of my
mortal enemies paul carter this you know
is correct about a lot of things him and
i just do this but uh him and i were on
the same side of the whole like lats in
bench pressing debate for raw lifters
people like it's a lats paul's like how
many lap tears you ever seen in a bench
press and everyone's like like and they
were saying like well pecs aren't that
important it's lats and triceps paul's
like how many pectares have you seen in
a bench press and everyone's like well i
don't know he's like makes you think
doesn't it i wonder what muscle's really
involved wow i like that too credit paul
you guys watching this has just been
served a treat
there you go
there you go charlie
let's see what we're trying to get me to
do
i'm having trouble
actually getting my brain to make my
body do that it's a difficult exercise
tighter lower back big chest tight lower
back
good stuff
try stop even at the bottom
chest up
those are great yeah good shit
chest up or go deep keep that bar close
see how you drifted out
yes
far down the body hips back
close close
chest
oh yeah
a couple more
go to the upper back corner of the room
but that way yes
beautiful
i'll pull up
one more one more time lower back right
lower back big chest adjuster just tight
lower back
as if you're going to do another as if
you're going to do another and put it
down slow chest up
yeah
something has to happen to your
hamstrings after that fill the traps
back
well you will
yeah
that's what gave out yeah i was close to
failure for my upper back up here your
hamstrings are working yeah they're
doing all this weird shit back there
oh yeah they're tingling oh yeah yeah
okay okay
butt up
don't reach forward
remember you're close the whole way
from right there hips it's where they
want to be that's where they want to be
more controlled eccentric
let's close more closer just like that
that's it
well my back's giving out yeah
you start doing that as yeah it's a good
time to react i feel like i'm stretching
them like this
yeah
i i can sit there on the floor and
stretch my hamstrings it feels it's all
upper back lower back
back back back let us know shoot me a
text or whatever in the next couple days
if you get hamstring soreness okay
you guys must be the ones that are the
deepest leg pressers on the planet
and you're about to join us
sometimes when i do it this way i feel
like i'm just trying to be too different
i feel like i'm in my own company there
you go
hamstrings are done
now it is lag press time
on the menu for myself personally is
four sets of leg press three of them
relatively heavy
sets of
oh 10 to 20 reps
and then one lighter set that's going to
be uh just like you know so i'm b i
think i'm doing like 635 pounds for
three sets of like 16 14 12 and then i'm
going to be doing a set of i think 16 or
18 or something with 495 so a little
down set there bigger pump etc more
volume and so it's four sets for me
because last week i did four et cetera
et cetera i know my volumes but
charlie's not going to need a whole lot
of sets because his quads are ultra
hyper responsive also he's going to be
using approximately 10 trillion pounds
and then uh mr jujumufu has never
trained leg press with us anymore and
that gives me the old joker smile
sounded like greg dussette
see if you can push your feet up a
little more so you can stay on your
heels at the very bottom
push your chest and tummy out
let your knees come out to the side so
they can kind of touch your armpits
like that yep you feel it through your
heels
i do know that you told me to do it
[Laughter]
all the way down
yes gentle pause at the bottom for every
rep
do about like eight total reps yes a
little pause down there just a just
little brief boss
[Music]
deeper
yes
good and there's nothing wrong with that
okay okay
i always thought that was showing off
because a lot of weight isn't showing
off
it's one of the other oh i was talking
about this oh i see no you have a
beautiful dick i know my my junk is much
more pronounced with a more deeper
accentuated stretch especially when i'm
wearing short shorts i like this machine
the first rep i did yeah that's when you
know you have a good machine when the
first rep you don't have to fuck with it
you have to find you know trying to make
it work it's one of the more important
pieces in the gym to get right because
you've got these prima donna
bodybuilders coming in here you know
yeah they're all fucking picky where do
i put my purse i need a good leg
i can't feel my hamstrings in this
barbell exercise can i get on the
machine over there
i won't say those are hundreds you know
600 plus 180 is 780 plus the sledge
probably about 135 that's easily 900
pound leg press this fucker's just
warming up with 900 i mean just being
around these guys makes you stronger so
i'm going to go ahead and warm up with a
900 pound leg press too
i don't have to wear knee sleeves though
because i'm not as strong as they are so
deep
yes i can't see you anymore that's it
every time i want you to touch the
bottom you guys are eating this up they
love that i love it
you're going to do as many reps as you
feel until you're like one or two reps
away from failure okay so we'll probably
figure that out together so we'll tell
you to
rest which means you lock your knees out
take a breather don't rack three or four
seconds later we'll say again we'll give
you a rep number we do two cycles of
that so go rest go rest rack
that's your total rep number for that
set okay no matching later okay okay all
right matching would be mile reps this
is my reps but it's not my rup match
every such just got three total my reps
in it understand so you just oh okay
that's it
but just do good technique and just
listen to our commands and you'll be
fine all right this your first contact
with the enemy soldier
you're giving me a license to go as deep
as possible on this exercise as long as
you're laying down just for views yeah
as long as your lower back doesn't round
it's totally good okay
[Music]
seven again
deep
yeah
rest breathe
breathe relax
four go
one
[Music]

way to control john these are
unbelievable
one more go
doesn't it dude it looks unbelievable
this is art i'm so happy that someone
actually encouraged me to get a full rom
on this one because usually i do it it
feels like i'm doing a stunt yeah you
know because i'm pretty flexible sure
sure so it's just like you feel your
quads yeah yeah
yeah it feels great can you imagine if
you said no it'd be like oh we have no
more tricks left yeah no i feel like i
feel like it's good in my groin
my quads
and not in my knees yes which is what i
want perfect overall exercise thank you

it's good enough
oh fuck
oh that's poison
my hand
you see that it popped open
yeah it's powerful it can't contain it
that's a good product plug i love it i
love these workouts
i like training this way so much more
than i've told you like
35 times already just this please come
back anytime these these are the best
these are the best
it just seems like you're
it's just good it's just like
literally it's the muscles not the
joints yeah well yeah the i have knee
problems this is great on my knees for
leg pressing i always have to be careful
people say my knees hurt i can't do leg
press
people say i can't go that deep my knees
hurt
i think maybe your knees hurt because
you're not doing this kind of stuff yeah
and you're doing all the shit that
really stresses your knees and not the
muscles yeah so going deep
taking your time with it getting the
technique right set right
putting your heels on the platform yeah
going super deep with good weight a lot
of times it tends to fix a lot of knee
problems yeah rather than exacerbate
them
it was a pleasure honor privilege
