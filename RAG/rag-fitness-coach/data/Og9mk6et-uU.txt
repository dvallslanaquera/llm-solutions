if you want to build muscle that's what
you're focused on that's what triggers
hypertrophic adaptations you've got a
solid program in place
you're lifting with proper form and
technique and you're
what's up guys sean aliwani

and in today's video we're talking about
the very unfortunate subject
of someone who is legitimately training
hard in the gym but they're not seeing
any significant muscle building results
from their efforts and maybe that
describes you right now you know it's
one thing to
not make any gains off of the work that
you didn't put in but there's nothing
worse than actually putting in the work
and then after several months of
consistent lifting
it looks like you've been training for
marathon running as opposed to muscle
growth now i've talked quite a bit in my
latest videos about the subject of
effort level in the gym
and how the basic fact that you train
hard how that is the underlying stimulus
for muscle growth
and the fact that most people out there
just don't train hard enough when it all
comes down to it
but again what happens when you really
are pushing yourself outside your
comfort zone
during your workouts you're leaving the
gym feeling beat up and like you really
gave a solid effort but the gains just
aren't happening
now before i explain this further if
you're new here and you're looking for
straight ahead

the hype and gimmicks then make sure to

to stay in the loop on all of my future
videos so
there are a wide variety of reasons why
this scenario could be happening
you know maybe you're just following a
really bad program in the first place in
terms of the actual layout there are
tons of
highly suboptimal programs floating
around out there online nowadays
i actually recently purchased one from a
very well-known bodybuilding youtuber
and i was almost on the verge of tears
while reading through it because of just
how off the charts horrifically bad it
was and just thinking about all the
people out there who
are actually going to go ahead and
perform a 40 set arm workout
with 20 reps for every single set with
almost no rest in between sets
thinking that this is a good way to
build muscle and i'll probably do a
review
on that program at some point but aside
from bad
programming there's also the whole
nutritional side of things as well
and if that's not reasonably on point
then that's obviously going to
negatively impact your results as well
but the reason that i want to talk about
here today another really common one
something i see all the time in the gym
and that is for the trainings out there
who confuse fatigue or exhaustion
with muscular overload okay those are
two different things
and if you're focused on the wrong one
which a lot of people out there are
then no exaggeration you legitimately
will be killing your gains
so you might be doing what a very high
percentage of people do
which is going into the gym with no real
set plan just kind of
gravitating toward whatever exercises
feel like a good idea on that particular
day
and the main intention that you have in
your mind is to just
get in a good workout you know to
achieve that overall feeling that you're
working hard
and then assuming that if you just do
that and you perform enough sets
and you do enough exercises over the
course of maybe an hour or so
muscle growth will automatically follow
so you're mainly paying attention to
things
like getting a pump uh the amount of
muscle burn that you feel during your
sets
and just how you feel on an overall
systemic level so how tired you're
getting
the fact that your heart rate is up the
fact that you're sweating maybe your
cardiovascular system feels a bit taxed
you're mentally fatigued you're sore in
the days after your workout
okay in reality none of those things
none of them are actually direct
indicators of a successful muscle
building workout now i'm not saying
they're bad
but they don't necessarily signify that
you successfully stimulated muscle
growth
obviously any form of exercise is good
for you okay even a workout that only
modestly stimulates muscle growth is of
course going to be far better than
sitting around all day in your
sweatpants eating tacos and
watching pornhub and if you're generally
training with reasonable overall effort
then you are going to get certain
beneficial adaptations from that
you know you'll probably gain some
muscle from that at least in the initial
stages
but from a pure hypertrophic standpoint
if you're beyond the first
few months of training and your goal is
to maximize muscle growth
those are the wrong metrics to pay
attention to fatigue
does not equal hypertrophy i don't care
how you feel on
an overall systemic level okay what
truly matters is what's happening at the
localized level
of the specific muscle tissue that
you're trying to stimulate and the fact
that you're overloading that tissue
by pushing it close enough to its
maximum strength capacity uh to create
new growth adaptations
and that you're doing that over a
sufficient number of total sets
uh in other words it ultimately comes
down to making sure that you're training
close enough to muscular failure on a
consistent basis
that is what stimulates muscle growth
regardless of anything else and what is
muscular failure
uh for those of you who are still
beginners it's basically just the point
in the set where you can't do any more
reps in proper form
regardless of how much effort you exert
now there is a certain
subjective component involved in this
because it's going to depend on
what exactly somebody means by proper
form in the first place and
just how much leeway they're giving you
know some people consider a bit more
form deviation to be acceptable
worse for others even if their form
deviates by the slightest margin or
they lose the mind muscle connection by
a few percent then they're going to
consider that to be failure
good
good all the way to failure
there we go all the way to failure
i personally don't agree with going to
that type of extreme i think as long as
your form
generally looks the same on each rep and
you're not at any sort of injury risk
then a slight bit of deviation is
usually going to be fine for most lifts
but just in the general broader sense
that's what muscular failure is okay
it's when you can't do another rep
in proper form despite your best effort
so probably somewhere around
three to four reps shy of failure is
where you're gonna start getting a
measurable growth response in most cases
you can definitely still make gains
training at that level if you're doing a
greater amount of overall volume to
compensate
but in any case it's definitely going to
be far from optimal if you're never
going beyond that point
more like one to two reps short of
failure that's going to be a good sweet
spot to base
the majority of your training around in
the overall picture at that level
you'll be getting a strong growth
stimulus but without creating excessive
fatigue
and then from there you can throw in
some all-out failure sets here and there
as well
and a very important thing to keep in
mind here is that it's perfectly
possible to experience
all of those things we talked about
previously okay muscle pump muscle burn
systemic fatigue cardiovascular stress
sweating
soreness even psychological fatigue as
well you can have
all of that and still not be training
anywhere near muscular
failure and as a result not gaining any
significant muscle from it on a
consistent long-term
basis you can do a very high volume of
sets with
eight reps in reserve and especially if
you're training using higher rep ranges
you can get in a great workout and still
stimulate very little actual muscle
growth from it
even though it is stressing your body
and you subjectively
feel like you're training hard the
adaptations that are going to be
occurring from that
are not going to be primarily
hypertrophic it's not going to be your
body
increasing its muscle mass and strength
what you're going to get from that are
endurance
slash conditioning related adaptations
that improve your body's ability to
perform that specific type of work okay
the type of stress that you place on
your body
determines the type of adaptations that
you're going to make to that stress
quite obviously and all it takes is just
some basic logic
to see that those factors can't be
direct indicators for growth
because you can create them by doing
ridiculous things that obviously
wouldn't be very effective for gaining
muscle
if more muscle pumps slash muscle burn
equals more muscle growth
then technically you'd never need to
lift a weight in your entire life you
know just grab
a flimsy resistance band and train each
muscle with thousands of reps on end
the pump and burn that you're going to
get from that would be completely insane
it'll be far beyond anything that you'll
get from doing
standard hypertrophy sets in the six to
twelve range in the gym
using regular free weights uh you can
even sit there right now and just
flex a muscle repeatedly as hard as you
possibly can and you're gonna get a
similar effect
or forget barbell squats and leg presses
just get up out of your chair right now
and do a bunch of air squats and jumping
jacks for the next 30 minutes straight
and your legs will be on fire from that
you'll be tired sweaty pumped you'll be
sore as hell the next day
but i think anybody with any lifting
experience at all knows that that's not
going to produce
significant long-term muscle growth at
least not for anybody who isn't a
complete and total beginner
even just speaking personally i've been
doing a lot of filming in the gym
recently because i'm going to start
uploading
some lifting tutorials on the channel
here that's actually the reason why my
uploads haven't been as frequent lately
because
i've been hard at work kind of behind
the scenes getting that all organized
but i'll go in with my videographer and
we'll shoot for
uh you know three or four hours straight
where i'm doing 12 different exercises
filmed from
five different angles each and i'm
lifting a really light weight i'm
probably 10 reps from failure on most
clips
but just from that constant repetitive
movement over and over again
shooting reshooting for hours on end my
muscles are burning they're pumped up
and i actually get more muscle soreness
from doing that than i do
from my actual muscle building workouts
now again there's absolutely nothing
wrong with muscle pump or muscle burn
soreness overall fatigue etc
those are natural byproducts of any form
of reasonably intense resistance
training
and of course those things are going to
occur when you do your workouts
but the way this works is that effective
muscle building training
will naturally produce those things but
it doesn't work the other way around
those things don't necessarily indicate
effective muscle building training
it's like if you put in a work session
on your laptop
and you genuinely are productive and
you're producing high quality work
then your brain is naturally going to
get tired from that but on the other
hand
just because your brain is tired as a
result of working
that doesn't necessarily mean that you
were truly productive even doing a bunch
of low productivity tasks combined with
a bunch of distractions thrown in
throughout you know checking your phone
browsing random websites
taking a 40-minute break to order tacos
and watch pornhub
that will still make your brain very
tired as well even if the work session
itself wasn't
truly effective so the main point here
is to stop using systemic
feel as your metric for muscle building
success and stop thinking that overall
fatigue
equals muscle growth you know that if
you just push yourself and
get in a good workout that you're gonna
make gains that's not how it works
gains are made by overloading the
specific muscles that you're trying to
target
and that means training those muscles
sufficiently close to failure again
for most sets about one to two reps in
reserve is a good target
if you want to build muscle that's what
you're focused on that's what triggers
hypertrophic adaptations
you've got a solid program in place
you're lifting with proper form and
technique
and you're overloading the muscle by
taking your sets up into that close to
failure zone on a consistent basis
and you're incrementally adding weight
to the bar over time okay progressively
overloading
that's how you gain muscle as a natural
lifter now technically if you always
truly trained close to failure then
those muscle building adaptations would
get triggered each time and you just
naturally get stronger from week to week
and progress automatically but i would
still strongly recommend that you track
your workouts on paper
since progress happens so incrementally
and a lot of times it's measured in
terms of single rep increases from week
to week
so you want to have those clear targets
in place so that you know exactly what
you did last time and what you need to
do this time in order to improve just
psychologically
having those objective goals in place is
going to keep you on the most efficient
path
and it will also clearly let you see
anytime you've plateaued
so that you can make the necessary
adjustments to your program and as far
as an actual program is concerned
