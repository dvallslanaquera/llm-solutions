so i'm not really sure what the fun
jason is talking about here
because the whole argument that he's
setting up is based on a completely
false premise
what's up guys sean aliwani real
realscienceathletics.com
and today i'm going to be reviewing a
video by dr
jason fung entitled intermittent fasting
versus cutting calories
and for those who don't know jason is a
kidney specialist and he has a pretty
big online following where he gives
nutrition slash weight loss advice
and it's basically centered around the
typical sort of anti-calorie approach
the idea that cutting calories doesn't
work
and that the key to losing fat is
through intermittent fasting and he also
wrote a book
about how to treat cancer using this
method as well
now before i go any further to make it
clear okay i am not at all against the
use of intermittent fasting and i'm not
even against low carb diets specifically
either
which is something that he also promotes
depending on the person and their needs
and their preferences
those can both be helpful tools and i
myself actually
just finished an 8 week fat loss phase
and i dropped 10 pounds
using intermittent fasting in
combination with a ketogenic diet
not because um i think that keto was
some kind of magical fat burning
approach
but as a fitness coach i was just doing
it as a personal experiment and i went
from this uh to this using both iaf and
keto combined and i'm gonna make a video
talking about my experience with that
uh pretty soon here so if you're a ride
or die jason fung fan
keep in mind that the argument here is
not that fasting doesn't work or that
you shouldn't do it
the argument is just that when total
calories are equated it's not going to
burn
more total fat in comparison to eating
regularly spaced meals
so i'm gonna go through this video and
break down some of the key stuff
and then i'll give you some practical
guidelines that you can follow if you're
looking to lose body fat and keep it off
long term
hey welcome back hi jason i'm dr jason
fung today what we're going to talk
about
is how fasting works for weight loss
where calorie counting
does not so first of all let's establish
something really important that a lot of
these
anti-calorie gurus frequently get mixed
up on
and it's a really basic thing and that's
just that eating fewer calories
and counting calories those are not the
same thing so
whether you're doing intermittent
fasting or you're eating regularly
spaced meals throughout the day
you can either count calories or not
count calories okay the act of counting
calories and the act of
simply being in a calorie deficit those
are two separate things
you absolutely do need to be in a
calorie deficit in order to lose fat no
matter what diet protocol you're using
that's a non-negotiable factor and
whether or not you specifically track
your caloric intake on paper
that comes down to the individual and
their specific needs and preferences
some people are going to need to track
their calories in order to lose fat
successfully and some people are not
going to need to track anything at all
but the bottom line is that the title of
his video intermittent fasting
versus cutting calories that doesn't
actually make any sense because they
describe
two different things to lose fat with
intermittent fasting you still
ultimately need to be cutting calories
since you can't lose fat without a
calorie deficit it's just that for some
people
intermittent fasting is an easier way to
cut calories which is something that
we'll talk about here in a second
suppose that we're eating 2 000 calories
in a day
and we're burning 2 000 calories in a
day well body fat remains stable
now we want to try to lose weight so
instead of 2 000 calories
we're going to try and get rid of that
and we're going to go down
to 1500 calories so we take off
a little bit of this box yup that would
be a very reasonable thing to do
and what we hope of course is that now
you've got negative 500 calories
and you're going to lose body fat as
long as your activity level is staying
consistent and you're truly eating
500 calories fewer then yes that is
exactly what will happen
unfortunately that's not what happens
come again all of the studies what
you've done to date
point to the fact that when you simply
reduce those calories in
what happens is that the amount of
calories that you expend which is your
basal metabolic rate also goes down
to 1500. so essentially his whole video
is kind of based on
this false premise here which is the
idea that if you reduce your calorie
intake
your body will automatically reduce its
energy expenditure by the exact same
margin and so you won't be able to lose
fat
but this is just not how things work in
reality when you create a calorie
deficit which you have to do
in order to lose fat whether you're
fasting or not then yes slowly over time
your metabolism is going to gradually
adapt to a certain extent as a way of
conserving energy
but it doesn't just happen overnight
like some instantaneous on off switch
and it doesn't happen to that
significant of a degree where the
adaptation
just perfectly matches the reduction in
calories your body still has
mandatory energy needs that it has to
fulfill to get through the day and it
can't just create energy out of thin
air it's like if you're driving a car
then there are certain things that you
can do
to slightly reduce the amount of fuel
that you use to get from point a to
point b
but no matter what there's still going
to be a certain amount of fuel that you
have to utilize
in order to get to where you're going
your car can't just decide
exactly how much fuel that it wants to
use in order to travel certain distances
so therefore when you take away these
calories
your body simply uses fewer calories
and body fat still remains stable and
we're not able to lose weight
the other really important factor on top
of this is that whether you're doing
intermittent fasting or you're eating
six meals a day or you're doing
something in between
metabolic adaptation kicks into the same
degree in all of those scenarios
when the total calories are the same so
intermittent fasting is not some special
approach
that magically circumvents metabolic
adaptation so
i'm not really sure what the fung jason
is talking about here
because the whole argument that he's
setting up is based on a completely
false premise
and if you logically follow that all the
way then where does this end you know if
i reduce my calories to
a thousand per day does my body just
magically
only now need a thousand calories to
function if i lower it to 500
then does my body only burn 500 if i
stop eating altogether then does my body
convert to using photosynthesis and get
all of its energy from the sun
again calories are energy and your body
is always going to require a concrete
amount of energy to function and to
survive no matter what
so here's the same thing but draw in a
different way
so i'm not going to play uh this whole
part of the video because it goes on for
quite a while
and it's a little bit convoluted but
basically it's just a standard argument
that goes something like when you eat
your body releases insulin and that
insulin shuts off fat burning
and so if you consume regularly spaced
meals throughout the day then your body
can't break down fat whereas if you fast
then insulin levels are lower and
there's no food coming in and so your
body has to break down fat for fuel
and this way oversimplified line of
reasoning
it's been used a million times before by
fasting proponents even though it's just
not
accurate if you're feeding you're
storing calories
when you're fasting you're using
calories and your body really only
exists
in one of these two states so in reality
it's not this black and white
binary thing okay both fat loss and fat
storage are occurring
all the time simultaneously throughout
your body to certain degrees just like
muscle growth and muscle breakdown are
happening
simultaneously as well and it's the sum
total of
all of these processes added up over the
long term that's what's going to
determine your net gains or losses in
body fat or muscle mass so we can't just
look at it through the super narrow lens
of
when you eat you store fat and when you
fast you burn fat therefore you must
fast in order to lose body fat okay we
have to look at the bigger picture
and in the bigger picture it still
ultimately comes down
to the total amount of energy going into
your body versus the total amount of
energy going out
based on your total daily energy needs
and yes insulin is technically a storage
hormone but it's still going to come
down to how many calories there
ultimately
are to be stored or not be stored if
you're in a net energy deficit
over time your body has no choice but to
break down stored body fat to use for
fuel again it can't just create energy
out of thin air
now this does not mean that calories are
the only thing that matters or that
every 2000 calorie combination of foods
is going to have
the exact same effect on your health and
your body composition
people always try to use that as an
argument you know not all foods are the
same 100 calories of chicken is not the
same thing as 100 calories of pop-tarts
and i've seen jae-fung make that same
argument many times as well
but that pretty much goes without saying
you know no one with half a brain cell
is actually making that particular
argument
yes micronutrients matter uh fiber
matters protein matters
your diet should be based primarily
around nutrient-rich whole foods no
matter what structure of eating you're
following
and no one out there is advising that
you eat 2 000 calories worth of twinkies
and soda every day
but once those basics are in place and
you do have
a relatively clean diet in place overall
then the total energy content of the
foods
absolutely does matter and you can't
just keep eating cleaner and cleaner and
cleaner over time
so if you want to now try to lose weight
you can simply extend this period of
fasting
so guys fat loss isn't about reducing
your calorie intake
it's about going for longer and longer
periods of time
without eating anything so hopefully you
can see the interesting line of
reasoning that he's using there
and that brings me to the key point here
which is that
that is the primary benefit of
intermittent fasting for most people
it doesn't help people lose fat because
of some special metabolic adjustment
that's being made
that causes you to physically burn fat
at a faster rate
what it does is it helps a certain
segment of people lose fat
because for them it's going to be an
easier and more sustainable way
to reduce their overall calorie intake
so it actually works via the exact
mechanism that j bone is supposedly
against
which is cutting calories when people
condense their eating window down into a
shorter period
maybe they only eat let's say two large
meals per day as opposed to four or five
or six meals
and they're not snacking regularly
throughout the day either for a lot of
people that will lower
their net energy intake by default since
their appetite is better controlled
and there's less of a chance for
overeating and then because of that
they'll finally get into a true calorie
deficit
which they might have had a harder time
doing before and since most average
people
don't actually track their calories in
detail and even the people who do track
their calories
are usually very inaccurate with it and
that's been shown time and time and time
again in the research
they're going to assume that their
newfound fat loss results are because of
some special effect from fasting itself
and they'll defend it to the death and
start claiming that calories don't
matter or that calorie deficits aren't
necessary for losing fat or that
counting calories doesn't work
when in reality all that's really
happened is that by rearranging the way
their meals are spaced out they're
consuming less total calories on average
usually without even realizing it
because this is the period of time
where you've opened up your body's
flow yes i believe that's the proper
scientific terminology
opening up your body's flow now i
usually like to
just explain things objectively in my
videos and not bring in isolated
anecdotes
but since jason spends about half of
this video using one success story as
evidence
from a guy who used intermittent fasting
and got great results from it
just think about this rationally okay
he's literally saying that if you reduce
your calorie intake then your body
automatically burns less to compensate
and so you won't lose fat
and he's saying that if you eat five
meals a day let's say
insulin levels are going to stay high
and so your body physically can't burn
fat if we're talking about anecdote okay
real world examples
then to see obvious first-hand proof of
just how
off the charts nutty that statement is
why not just look at the people who are
basically the most skilled at losing
body fat and reducing it down to the
lowest levels possible people who
literally make their living from that
which is going to be physique
competitors now yeah some of them are on
performance-enhancing drugs which does
change things but there are still
millions of natural competitors out
there as well and some of them follow
intermittent fasting
but the majority percentage don't and
for many years in the fitness industry
it was actually standard advice that if
you wanted to lose fat as effectively as
possible
you should eat a small meal every two to
three hours throughout the day
in order to keep your metabolism
elevated so if
cutting calories doesn't work and if
eating frequent meals throughout the day
prevents fat loss from occurring then
all of these natural bodybuilders
not just the ones who compete but also
the recreational ones too they wouldn't
be getting
absolutely peeled and shredded down to
single digit uh body fat levels by doing
exactly those things
and i showed my own results at the start
of this video using intermittent fasting
and keto
this is around the level of leanness
that i am right now but also
here's me from several years ago where i
got even leaner than this
and i did that by eating five to six
meals a day and where over half of my
calories came from carbohydrates
the only common denominator between
these two fat loss phases
is the simple fact that i tracked my
calories and i was in a roughly 500
calorie deficit
give or take in both of those cases if
what jason fung talks about is accurate
then i shouldn't have been able to reach
that level of leanness and i should have
lost fat more effectively this time
around which was not the case okay the
overall rate of fat loss
as far as i can see it as far as i can
measure there was really no difference
and it's because that's what drives fat
loss it's the calorie deficit that's the
ultimate bottom line
and fasting or not lower carb medium
carb higher carb
meal frequency meal timing these are all
just tools that each individual can
tweak for themselves
to be able to maintain that calorie
deficit in a way that they can sustain
most easily over time so at the end of
the day you really just have to
experiment a bit
and find the style of eating that you
most prefer if you enjoy fasting and if
you find that it helps you
manage your food intake more easily then
by all means you absolutely should go
ahead and do it
but at the same time don't be fooled
into thinking that if total calories
are the same for the day that you're not
going to lose fat by eating regularly
spaced meals
since this is just complete bs and it's
obviously not
true and the fact that all of these
popular diets each have their own group
of
die-hard supporters who swear by the
benefits whether it's intermittent
fasting or keto
or vegan or carnivore or paleo or
whatever else
that should prove to you right there
that there's no such thing as
one definitive best fat loss diet for
every single person out there
especially considering that some of
these diets are literally the complete
opposite of each other
but if you really look at it there's one
common denominator across all of them
that runs underneath the foods and
underneath the meal spacing and the meal
timing and the macro breakdowns
and everything else and that is the
calorie deficit okay that's the primary
factor
and the actual dietary structure that is
just a collection of tools that are used
to ultimately facilitate
the implementation of the calorie
deficit itself if you found this advice
