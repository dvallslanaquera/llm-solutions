listen Real Talk there's only one Natty
bodybuilder in here and that's how you
know we're being real
we're not trying to say some shit about
us
[Music]
what's up RP YouTube today I have a
client of mine from Hong Kong many of
you might know who this is if you follow
me on Instagram some of you just do the
YouTube thing so maybe you don't but
this is Marvin AKA Marvin the Martian
AKA Martin if you're Scott our video guy
but he is one of the leanest men of all
time
um he's a natural Pro from the wmbf he
just got second place at the world uh
World Championships in LA
and we are taking him to Nationals to
try to give him an ifbb Pro card as well
in the lightweight bodybuilding division
so that'll be interesting but he's
tripping yeah yeah it's going to be a
good time I'm tripping listen to this
guy the self-doubt's already starting
you can tell he's from Hong Kong yes
well no it's going to be a great time uh
today we're putting him through a little
pool session uh back today and then legs
tomorrow yeah oh no push tomorrow no no
legs tomorrow okay cool so let's uh
let's get to it Marvin's probably gonna
take a shirt off at some point and
everybody's gonna flip shit and you guys
can make all the not natural claims in
the comments that you wish
[Music]
I want you to take a little bit wider
grip than normal and you're gonna row to
the top of your chest and then so it's
gonna be here and then you're gonna take
it and you're gonna row you're gonna
talk a little bit more narrow grip and
root of your stomach that's shit I try
to be full of this this one is hard okay
so the higher we hit on the chest with a
bit more the more the upper back you're
gonna hit so like this yep
good
and then you'll reset your grip take
more narrow grip
here yeah whenever you have weight on
there okay and you go road to your
stomach like this first exercise of the
day is going to be a barbell row two
chest superset with a barbell bend over
row we're doing this to limit the load
Marvin is between shows right now he has
like two and a half weeks left until
Nationals so we're really using a lot of
the same variations but with intensity
techniques thrown in so this intensity
technique is this exercise was a barbell
bent row but we're adding in that first
component of barbell road to chest
instead obviously it's more just
advantageous so it's a harder exercise
so you're doing the road to chest first
limiting the load and then you're going
into that bent row so this will be his
first exercise then we're going to a
machine row and uh continue hitting the
back later we're going to do some biceps
and delts my favorite part about this
she's about to do
this super set with 95 pounds
which I'm pretty sure we had a pretty
jacked female on the channel doing
and half the comments in this video are
still going to be that he's not natural
he's 154 pounds on stage
tight lower back road chest Marvin
there it is
touch every time
there it is
[Music]
stomach
there you go oh that's your stomach
every time
big chest
there you go
done
ah fuck what were you gonna say let's do
it
what does it mean ah fuck this
sort of so it means something worse
great well I've done this but not this
good form before yeah that looks great
you see a lot I can see a lot of growth
in the off season yeah yeah I think it
will I mean how do you think about the
off season look at that true true
bodybuilder over here I mean you want to
work on your weakness right
this Escape
there you go oh yeah
[Music]
great stretch
big chest reach there you go
make sure you touch
[Music]
oh yeah good stomach
big chest
[Music]
wow beautiful morning
and just slow it down
[Music]
oh that's it good done nice man yeah
much better this is good that's good
yeah you can warm up on the primer over
there if you want clean up first oh
you're good I got it okay thank you
[Music]
next exercise simply because this is the
only rowing machine in the gym is the
prime seated row Marvin is going to do
the prime cheetah row
for you can put it on the same one put
on the same Peg put it on two I don't
the force curve stuff
so uh seated machine row
for a second exercise he was using
something similar at Dragon for the last
month so this isn't too bad
um three sets here 15 to 20 range this
will be his uh our last straight set
movement before we move into an
intensity technique first one was a
superset but we still rested a pretty
good amount between sets here he's gonna
do two or three sets 15 to 20 reps rest
a good amount then when we go into the
seed deflection row he's going to be
doing a giant set and he's going to have
limited rest periods on that but it's
really going to cook his back finish it
off before his last exercise was the
vertical pulling exercise
um so horizontal emphasis today again
we're just doing enough volume to
maintain this lean tissue between shows
we had a couple of high days so he's
definitely primed for a really good pump
today
um so yeah seated machine row
two to three sets 15 to 20 reps let's
get to it
[Music]
foreign
which then people sometimes get confused
and that first bit of their eccentric is
also fast so they're like forceful new
like they just go like this and they
drop it I want a forceful concentric
phase I want you to pause and
immediately switch back to all right
this needs to be a slow eccentric melt
the shit out of your Eastern trick and
don't
because then another thing people do is
they'll get to like the end of the
Eastern trick and instead of continuing
to stretch they'll be like okay it's
time to go up so they kind of Bounce
it's the same to go squats and they do
the bench press they really control and
they kind of like double bounce off
their chest and they try to push too too
quickly so really control a decent trick
you should have a pause here with a full
stretch and a pause here for the
forceful concentric okay slow pause all
stretch stretch forceful right don't
speed up any part of that motion because
you're caught up in that concentric
needs to be fast fast so it's gonna suck
because there is going to be quote
unquote constant tension on the muscle
right it's gonna hurt and you're gonna
get less reps yes but it's okay okay got
it got it
that's it good nice pause at the bottom
too good stuff I'm not worried about how
many reps you get here Marvin I want
every rep to you fucking perfect so
don't shortchange the concentric and
don't shortchange the East forceful come
on
slow remember when you're going back
into the e-centric motion it needs to be
controlled
yes
full
that's it
yes Marvin beautiful man let's go
[Music]
oh yeah come on Marvin
you got three or four more
yes sir yes sir yes sir
full stretch full stretch
forceful
[Music]
last one last one let's go let's go oh
you got another one now that was
bullshit that was bullshit slow Marvin
slow slow flow stretch hard hard
forceful
good fuck fuck
that shit go ahead candies go ahead fuck
you Jared go ahead
[Laughter]
good stuff man how'd that feel
best set good stuff thank you
[Music]
50 total reps fifty fifty fifty five
zero so like a time set uh so what do
you think how do you feel with that
weight
that's good next exercise is going to be
a seated cable flexion row
that's an intensity technique as I
stated before it's gonna be a giant set
but with short rest periods I've stated
this on the channel already but there
are two ways to perform a giant set one
way is the Giants that kind of just
allows you to
pick a Target rep range pick a weight
and that way weekly especially during
your contest prep when you really died
it down and you're getting glycogen
depleted and you feel like your quote
unquote strength is dipping but really
it's just a lack of glycogen
this allows you to just focus on the
number of the volume that you're getting
in total the sets are like just kind of
non-existent because you might get five
sets one week and the next week it's
really fucking hard so you get seven but
the next week you have a repeat so it's
four sets but you're getting it in this
allocated rep range that you put on the
week this week is 50. next week's gonna
go up by probably five to ten reps
Etc so you're not really worrying about
the sets you're just able to focus on
the weight the Reps and getting as many
as you can with that week's relative
like proximity to failure so the
relative intensity this week though
we're doing that with short rest periods
so that's kind of a way you can spice it
up and really really push the
metabolites since this is weak two and a
half weeks out uh that's really what
we're trying to do it's his last show of
the year he's been dieting for quite
some time definitely going to be hard to
get a rep match next week because we're
gonna be pushing the diet kind of hard
50 reps this week 55 next week it might
take four sets this week and it might
take seven next week we're not really
worried about that we're just worried
about keeping the rest period consistent
keeping the weight consistent and moving
up in reps over the course of time
three more
big chess
this is like jerky
Marvin I really want you to focus on not
shortchanging your Ecentric okay you get
to a point where it gets hard and you
start you know you're gonna be it's
gonna be a hard concentric so you kind
of short Change you just try to go right
back into it yeah right there deep
stretch
there you go Marvin good
beautiful stretch
one more one more one more
yeah I mean if you just say oh fuck
you're doing good but no improvement
that's like a circle jerk
my masturbation you do nothing 100 yeah
on the stage yeah
yeah I won't lie to you if you've got to
clean up your Technique you got to clean
it up if I think you're going to do well
to show you're probably gonna do well to
show you know I'm not going to lie to
you about it yes yes sir and I think you
can do very well at Nationals you know
thank you man yeah so let's fucking I
believe in you now so these next two
weeks matter all right so let's do this
last seven that's it make them perfect
good morning stretch yes
[Music]
pull
[Music]
good shit
good shit
good job thank you yeah that was good
the last rep there how you kind of did
it exactly as if you were going to do
another one it's perfect pull Downs next
[Music]
last exercise of the day uh again this
was this horizontal emphasis pulling
a lot of rhomboid a lot of mid-trap now
we're going to focus on the lats with a
pull down exercise
um we do pull Downs here because
he might be able to get a pull-ups he's
154 pounds
um I'm a fan of either assisted pull-ups
on this exercise or pull down variation
it helps a lot because you're already
super pumped most of your back's pretty
toast including your Erectors so the
pull down just helps you to be able to
get kind of into that higher rep range
use this as a
horizontal emphasis with lighter
vertical pulling so when you're doing a
lighter vertical pulling you're trying
to get into more of that 10 to 20 rep
range pull Downs are perfect for that so
we're gonna do three sets here
probably 15 to 20. I like the upper
range of that for this deep into contest
prep
again just kind of building a ton of
metabolites just doing enough falling
intimating muscle tissue three sets of
15 to 20 reps and that's going to finish
off the back workout remember don't lean
when you pull you're just pushing your
chest up forcefully oh yeah Marvin
fucking perfect
[Music]
good Marvin let's go
great stretch
rip this part this apart rip it apart
rip it apart yes down big chest don't
lean I want it force them but I want it
from the chest and the elbows
better yes Marvin that's perfect
[Music]
deep stretch
oh yeah good stuff good fucking stuff
how's that yeah a little different than
you normally yeah good oh okay so
definitely got lost correct okay and
that's good that's good room of
improvement I like it
that's what I need more and more
Improvement talking more Improvement
yeah it looks good man
back double
good Marvin
hang out feel it stretch keep it up
just just
I'm just worried about quality I don't
give a shit about you actually getting
her up
[Music]
that's it done
thank you thank you boss good stuff dude

I've I've taught hip-hop dance to

schedule every Wednesday at 11 A.M I'm
there and you know it's like
watching those kids get that inspiration
