hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization i forgot my last name
oh well i never pronounce it properly
anyway today's topic is very related to
the last topic
this time it's 10 tips for online
coaches
because a lot of us are personal
trainers but tons of us coach online
we want to do our very best online's a
tough market sometimes because there's
so many folks
how do you differentiate yourself how do
you do the best job possible to get the
most success for you can
for yourself that you can and also like
uh you know actually get people in shape
as best as you can
so let's take a look we got 10 good tips
here here we go
number one and it is number one because
it's the first thing before you get any
clients
be warm and helpful just like a trainer
would be at a gym
do that online with your internet
presence okay
if you're a dick even if you're correct
about stuff
you won't get a ton of clients because
people think you're
fucking dick and they won't talk to you
right you can go on every youtube page
and every instagram page
that has tons of followers and just
correct everyone's comments
technically you're wrong because mrv but
nobody gives a shit man and if you come
off like a dick they don't even usually
read the rest of your comment
or you can get a debate with other
incels and be dicks to them and get
nothing out of it at all what you can do
is answer some common questions people
have in the comments because look a lot
of times
big pages don't they don't the person
runs a page doesn't answer all the
questions sometimes any of the questions
right shit on youtube i'm not in the
comments you feel me i'm not in the
comments on this video it's very likely
very likely i will never be in the
comments all right because i'm just busy
doing other shit like recording these
videos
but the thing is there's lots of folks
that come up in the comments instagram
youtube facebook etc
that like are just fucking lost and they
need help and they're asking questions
you can shit on them
that's not gonna get you any clients or
you can be very polite and help
and they're gonna be like man thank you
so much but that was tons of help
and then what they might do is after
that nothing happens
and then they have another question
later or somebody else does and they see
that you're also answering
that person's questions or their
question again very kindly and very
helpful they're like this person's
awesome and they follow you
okay and then nothing happens right
weeks later
you post on your instagram like hey
folks i got a couple openings for
clients that really have zero clients
but you say shit like that to make it
look like you're successful right
dm me if you're interested they might
have been looking for an online coach
but like they look at like
big dog prices i'm like fuck that i'm
not paying 900
a month for anything they're like dude
this person's great they help me a ton
hey and they're in pretty good shape
they send you a dm and all of a sudden
you gotta
get a fucking client just like that
right it doesn't mean you need to
troll these pages and comment as much as
possible but when you have an
opportunity when you have a chance
be helpful and be nice and that really
is just awesome for your online presence
like somebody that does this really well
is like um steve hall of revive stronger
he's just like a super nice guy just
answers people's questions it's hard not
to like him
they'll tell you what he's not
struggling with clients all right number
two
when you're on your own social media
produce a lot of helpful content
okay what does that mean ig posts blurbs
lifting videos food pictures short
videos
that address various concerns shit like
this one you know
uh article shares that you think are
interesting
stuff like that just try to educate
people not like educate sounds stupid
because it's so top down
try to throw out some good stuff that
people like and they can get something
out of
simplify the process give some quotes
give some blurbs because what's that
going to do
it's two things well three one you're
gonna help people which is nice
two people are gonna follow you and
three they're gonna know that you like
no shit
you know and they get a lot of shit out
of you like tried some shit you said and
it worked and you're like wow
okay this is great like this person
knows stuff
so that when you make your next post
about
training folks and about taking on
clients for diet coaching online
you're going to have a ton of dms
because they're going to be like i
didn't even know you did this right a
bunch of times if you put out content in
general that's just great people will dm
you anyway
if you've never advertised your coaching
services at all and they'll just be like
hey like uh
can i be your client and like i'm the
motherfucker that does this shit i don't
even take clients because i got so much
other shit going on with rp
that at the end of the day i have to be
like no sorry but we have a team and our
peter can help you which is nice because
then they go to them and they get help
but
that's the thing is i don't even
advertise as a coach and i still get a
ton of stuff right so if at a smaller
level you come in and you provide a ton
of value
man people will just start asking if you
can help them because clearly you're
helping already
right really really really good thing if
you just stay silent on instagram or
whatever
people don't really sort of know who you
are and they might not be amenable to
offering you the opportunity to coach
them online number three
a lot of these by the way are very very
similar if not identical
to last video we did which was on
personal training tips so i'm going to
go through these a little bit quicker
but if you want more detail on that you
go back to the personal training videos
really a lot of these are simple so
number three
is listen to what the client wants once
they are your coaching clients so the
first two were just sort of how to get
clients
once you have any one client you're one
client we've all been there by the way
there's gonna be a time in your career
and probably has been already where you
have one client
we call yourself a personal trainer and
people like how many clients do you have
you're like um you know
who don't i have as a client everyone
else but one person
right so it's okay you start out with
one right when you start out with one or
10 or 15 or whatever
um you have to do fundamentally provide
them the service that they want
they have certain goals and you're going
to want to try to get them there
yes you have to phase out what's
unrealistic if they say i want to lose
80 pounds of body fat in the next three
weeks gosh i'm like well
it's probably not going to happen but
here's what i can get listen to your
clients give them what they want don't
impose your own values on them
number four definitely develop a basic
roadmap as to how to get there
and this is really cool because a lot of
times when you're an online coach you
interact
well all the time you interact digitally
which means sometimes you interact in
written form
dms emails stuff like that sending
someone a plan or basic road map
is much easier than like being a
personal trainer describing them like
what we're gonna do is because they
might listen to you and they might not
but if they have an email of like a
basic phasic plan you're like we're
gonna diet for the following number of
months
we're gonna progress your calories as
needed we're gonna increase your
intensity they're literally reading and
they're like wow this person has a plan
that's so great you first of all you
need a plan for best results
and second of all plan illustrates to
them that they're being cared for
that that's not a haphazard process and
that you know what you're doing so it's
all
really really great stuff you don't have
to give them the super nitty-gritty
details of the plan
high level will do but at least a high
level is a really good idea
number five you want to ease into
training and especially
diet particularly you want to focus on
quality first
quantity seconds so if you are an online
training coach
i highly recommend doing video analysis
so they say i did squats today you'd be
like video okay
the thing is nowadays it's so easy
because everyone has enough
data streaming power to do that and also
everyone has a cell phone and they can
just record their videos it doesn't have
to be like i need a real working set
in warm-ups too right no just one set
you know top set of squats or something
then you can fix quality you can make
sure they're going hard enough every set
maybe not too hard
make sure that their technique is really
good first focus on making sure their
technique is great
and they're training hard enough and
their exercise execution is what you
want it to be
and on the diet side make sure they know
how to build good meals
so when you send them like macros or
something or you send them a meal plan
they're not just eating like beef jerky
and lemonade powder just with a spoon
and like a glob of butter and they're
like there's my macros
yes those are technically macros that's
the only thing you got right
right maybe like at some point you're
gonna say okay well
here's how to build a healthy meal you
might send him a pdf about that you
might do a video call with him about
that so on and so forth
once you get the quality down then you
can focus on quantity and so on and so
forth right
but ease into all that stuff you don't
want to be like here's welcome to your
new life as my client
you're going to do blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah they're like fuck i got
to do 10 different things
just start out super simple and then as
the client maybe they've experienced
before
you can sort of rope in faster if they
don't have experience before great
you're educating someone
you're easing them into the whole
process and sooner or later they're
going to be really really competent and
be able to do a lot of stuff and get
excellent excellent results
number six very much in line with the
last one
slowly ramp up the training and diet
difficulty over time you don't ever want
to do something that's not sustainable
it has to be realistic
but at some point you know push a little
harder push a little harder especially
when they say stuff like oh it's pretty
easy this week you're like oh shit
you got yourself into it now and it
should be intense
but fun right that's really the goal and
then people don't get rid of you as a
coach because who the hell doesn't like
intense and fun because it brings
results and is a great time
the thing is here it's always a
sort of auto-regulatory discovery
process you don't know who can be pushed
how hard uh until you try
so that like inching step forward is
like at some point they're gonna be like
ah and you back off
and then you start inching again at some
point maybe similar point or maybe a
higher point
or a lower point they're gonna be like
they're gonna fuck off right
you have to push like that slowly and
gently to see who's capable of what
because some clients you could push them
and push them and push them and very
gentle push
and they're like woof this is too much
okay it's okay but after a couple of
those experimental pushes you know your
bandwidth you're dealing with you know
that this person's not going to eat six
pre-weighed meals a day the best thing
you can do with them is make sure that
when they get the double chicken finger
rap at mcdonald's they get the fucking
grill fingers
not extra mayo okay and that's where you
meet them and you try to do a little
better every time but you know what's
realistic on the other hand
some people who start out some of my
best clients ever when i was an online
coach and when i was a personal trainer
were for some reason corporate lawyers
i'll tell you exactly why these are
fucking insane meticulous people like
insane in the best possible way of like
super type a
like if you're like hey you know
anything about nuclear weapons like no i
don't like build me a nuclear device
like great they go to the library they
get 10 books on nuclear thermodynamics
and then 10 years later they're like
here you go
what the hell like what's wrong with you
right they approach fitness in much the
same way and
you don't know that so you start out
with some corporate lawyers like hey
you're online coach i want to get abs by
the summer it's like all right it's
fucking
october but here we go and then like 10
weeks in
you're like how are you doing and they
send you a picture and they have like
veins on their apps like what the
fuck and like hey i wanted to take my
diet and training a bit more seriously
and you're like
uh right on and you send them specific
macros meal by meal timing all the stuff
and they're like i love it i love it i
can't believe this transformation
i want more i want more of a challenge
you're like fuck i
run out of tools to use on you man so
that's great some people just rise super
high
some people don't you have to have an
exploratory process you can't just
templatize your way into it we're
usually everyone's getting the same
progression
and if you're too tough whatever we're
not going to train you that hard or die
you hard enough
and if you fail out then you fail out
you can meet everyone where they are and
do as good of a job as
can be done with them right number seven
as you're doing this exploratory process
watch for their preferences and watch
for their irritations maybe they like
when exercise versus another maybe some
rep ranges are better for them versus
others
maybe some foods or ways of dieting or
better for example you can have the same
calories in the same calorie deficit
when you feed them higher fats they're
like dude i'm bloated i feel like shit
and when you feed them
higher carbs at lower fats like i'm a
machine and i'm exuding energy
everywhere i love this
or the other way around you never can
tell when you play around or when you
don't ask them
so just ask them be like hey like how's
your 3pm meal feeling when you have a
5pm workout they're like i'm glad you
asked because a lot of people don't give
feedback unless they're asked because
they think like okay
i'm the client i do what the coach says
right because asking too many questions
kind of illustrates sometimes that
you're a wuss you know do i have to eat
this meal like what the fuck do you
think i wrote it on your program for
but sometimes you're like how's your 3pm
meal like you know what man i'm glad you
asked
i can't digest the shit fast enough i
end up feeling real sick during my
workout
awesome you cut that meal by some
fraction or you cut out the fats or cut
out the
carbs a bit and all of a sudden next
week they're like oh my god dude my 3m
3pm meal is awesome
my workouts have gotten better and i get
more food later at night because i'm
always hungry then because we took those
calories and moved them amazing right so
always check in
and make sure there's not one way of
doing things there is absolutely some
give and take there for what
annoys them or what they like so on and
so forth next up number eight
track their progress all right strength
work capacity body composition etc
for essentially two reasons one to make
sure you're doing a good job keep you on
track
because like if they're getting fatter
and you're saying they're hypochloric
they're not hypochloric or something is
wildly off
right so you keep uh take measures
to make sure you're on track and also to
allow them to understand that the
process is working because it's really
easy to get in your head and be like oh
i think i'm losing fat i don't know
and then the dexa come back comes back
and you lost five percent fat in the
last six months you're like oh wow
wow this is going super well even comes
down to strength stuff like
people will just do programs and do
programs and do programs some of us are
like that
and we won't like realize how far we've
come because it's always challenging in
the program and then you get a deload
and a breath of fresh air and then it's
challenging again
you could say someone like hey like you
know you lateral raise the 30s for a set
of 10 this week and they're like yeah
sure did and
like we started your program two two
years ago you were doing the 15s and
they're like
huh bullshit and you send them your old
excel docs where you have that written
in and they're like
uh sure did huh all right i feel pretty
good and it's the next time
someone offers them competitive
competitive training service or maybe
they um
and they look you know a friend is using
a trainer and a friend's really pumped
about bad online coaching like dude you
got to try online coach xyz it's great
and then maybe ask the friend they're
like hey so like have you progressed a
lot in the last six months like yeah
like on quality stuff not exactly on
exercises
they're never gonna hire that coach they
might they might be polite and be like
oh cool y'all think about it but the
back of their head like
fuck that my coach has rocketed my lifts
like and how do i know that cause we've
been keeping track
right if your clients know that you've
been keeping track and you're
objectively going
and improving improving improving their
impetus to hire somebody else
is like really low i mean like you know
imagine getting invoices
in pictures every day you're like the
boss of nasa or something
and every day you ordered a rocket built
and every week they sent you
a picture of the rocket's bigger and
bigger and has more fancy shit on it and
there's like a flight test in there
somewhere
like are you going to be like hey
fucking fire this team they're not doing
a good job no
you're going to be like that's fucking i
assume we're getting close to getting a
real rocket going
and you're not gonna have a problem with
anything to do it which is which is
really great so to that extent right
number nine the whole process unfolds
like this
you hit distinct goals with your clients
that you choose together that are
rational reasonable and challenging
you let them bask you make sure that
you're like dude you're amazing look at
this fat you lost look at what you did
i'm proud of you saying that
people generally like to hear it even if
they don't admit it it's a good thing
you don't want to just
endlessly toil for no reward whatsoever
and i'll tell you what
the coach client relationship is sort of
one of some social dynamics there
where especially if you're kind of a
little bit
dry on the praise every now and again
when a client does something really big
and finishes their diet you're like you
know what robert i'm
really proud of you like you knock this
diet out them getting that email
sometimes they're like coaches proud of
me
i did it like they could feel really
really awesome right so it's really
really good thing to let them bask in
their glory
for a little bit and then gently
re-communicate
reset the goals figure out together what
you're going to do repeat the process
and eventually they're going to be
jacked and lean and sith style they're
going to fucking turn on you
so always have your lightsaber on you
and you know what i'm saying
you ain't coming for the champ baby i've
been here before i've killed so many
apprentices
apprentice i who knows
last point number 10
you want to advertise your progress and
you want to do it on the internet
where the clients are you can be the
best coach in the world
and because you only get sort of word of
mouth internal connection clients
uh you get some clients to do a good job
but the rates you can charge because if
you raise them too high most the clients
will drop off are going to be relatively
low
your income is going to be thus
relatively low and your job security is
going to be relatively low
you don't have tons of people waiting on
your waiting list because nobody really
knows about you or not nearly as many
people as could
what you want to do is advertise your
results no nonsense ads tend to be the
best for long-term
results okay that means pre and post
pictures
not tons of filters and shit but like
look here's janice day one
here's janice day60 and you're like man
okay janice is like an old out-of-shape
woman
but god damn she looks way less out of
shape after day 60
and they think like people that see it
are like if janice can do this
man i can for sure do this right so it
doesn't all need to be bodybuilders and
super impressive pictures because
that is another downside if like amazing
crossfitter was in amazing
shape and then got into like crazy shape
you could be like wow rp's the shit
if i were an elite crossfitter but you
might be like i'm not so i don't know
like they have amazing genetics of
course they got in good shape that's not
for me
you just don't relate to any of those
pictures as a client potentially but if
rp got a person who was in
meh shape into like map plus shape like
oh well he still looks like a regular
guy but damn he's literally
gained some muscle lost some fat this is
great almost three months that's pretty
good six months that's pretty good
then you can think like i can do this
too and then your chances of reaching
out and be like hey can you guys coach
me is much higher
right client testimonials are also
really good you know especially if
they're on the shorter side
of a client sending an email of course
always ask if it's okay to share it if
it's not no big deal
but you know sometimes clients say the
clients say the darndest things
right they say things that are so
touching and heartwarming and so amazing
from a different perspective than you're
used to they'll say shit like you know
like
you know coach trevor fentner he changed
my life and you're like uh
wow i did okay you might not even know
that that was the case but look like you
post a client testimonial someone's
you know was pouring their heart out all
of your followers and maybe some people
that aren't even following you just
happen to see the post
they're going to think like ah
somebody's doing a real good job here
you know and when they do come on to the
market of personal training or a cousin
or an aunt or a friend of theirs does
they get like
go uh coach trevor rp seems like a real
swell guy
check out this testimonial they're gonna
really be like something something at
least a good person
you know something's happening um make
sure you do this
share results on various social media
not inundated not overwhelming
but just put yourself out there like hey
we're doing good work here and if you
want to come be a part of the process
like
you know sometimes i i get some slots
open right and all of a sudden people
look at you and like not a scam artist
he's not like a marketing
hype crazy person like the ceo of
ceo of ceos teaches you how to make
seventy thousand dollars a
second on facebook like fuck clicks on
those ads anyway
this is like a legit person a legit
company doing good work and they're more
likely to click the more clear follow
through
and then once they click and follow
through you're kind of warm you're
welcoming
and you're not bragging but you're just
like hey like we can maybe help you
right
all of a sudden you're doing super well
your business is taking off you charge
more per hour or whatever per personal
training client and you have a waiting
list
and um you buy that jag that you always
wanted
a few years later i mean convertible v10
do they have a v10 jag of course they do
for you
anything and you're riding around in
your convertible and there's like a
truck in front of you and there's like
these metal pipes right
and like the truck hits a bump one of
the metal pipes just boom right through
your
left eye socket just killing you in your
jag the benefit is
the police when they arrive to the scene
they'll be like huh but then they'd be
like
this guy had it made you know final
destination's a motherfucker though
folks
see you in the next video
you
