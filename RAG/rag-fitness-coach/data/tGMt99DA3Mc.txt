folks we are back it's good to be back
dr james dr mike we are here to answer
your questions from youtube dr mike
how's it going
good i can't wait to answer these
questions
[Laughter]
[Music]
you know they've been pretty good lately
there was a stretch back on the rp plus
days where we would get like the same
questions every time and there was a few
weeks where i was just like oh my god if
i get one more fucking like mini cut
question or a question that the the
basic question is this you guys say to
do this but i'm a snowflake thoughts
and there's always like do what we said
still still do it
i know you want to answer drug questions
but there's a drug question drogas
speaking of drugs
i got our first guy lined up our writing
uh i was trying to think of what you
said like drug addict guy and russian
was narcoman right
[Laughter]
all right ryan davis actually up
got it
all right
so ryan davis asks hey docs is there
anything to the idea of doing exercise
give a bigger pump first
and
following that with an exercise that has
a bigger stretch whenever i do tricep
push downs
then follow that with overhead tricep
extensions the stretch feels amplified
compared to doing just overhead
extensions and cause more soreness
disruption even with volume equated
thanks for all the great content so i'll
say if it causes more soreness
destruction even with volume equated
it's probably a good thing to do
but um
mechanistically you will be weaker in
the overhead extension after getting a
pump doing other triceps stuff and thus
you won't be able to put as much load in
a stretched position overhead as you
would otherwise so just on that
mechanics i'd have to say that i can't
do three cheers for that whole pump
before stretch thing because it would
reduce the amount of
load you used to stretch
another thing is you can only do high
loads when you're fresh but you can
always get a big pump even after you're
tired
so
if you do get a better disruption like
that i think that's great keep doing it
i don't predict that everyone will and
for those that don't i would say you're
totally fine doing it the other way
around because mechanistically that
aligns potentially even more with what
you're doing than otherwise james
yeah so i would say like just just
chasing this pattern of like pump and is
maybe not necessarily by itself the way
to go if the subsequent exercise kind of
sucks anyway right so if you have like a
low sfr exercise as the as the number
two and you you like well i want to get
a big stretch and it's
that doesn't really hold up but in this
case if it's like a combination of two
exercises and their combination
increases the sfr of the subsequent one
when performed that way yeah that seems
fine with me i don't i don't really have
anything to say other than that i would
just say like this this inherent idea of
like pump first then chase the stretch
um
i wouldn't i wouldn't just take that at
face value i think we always fall back
to the idea of like sfr am i getting a
good stimulus with this exercise don't
just pick an exercise for the sake of
chasing some
exaggerated stretch response
[Music]
mixed up is some guy
called
cerberus oh it's oh it's a mass effect
reference he's got the elusive man
little avatar
cerberus was like the uh
the human terrorist organization in that
game series
they were like the um like the alt-right
group from space basically oh trippy
okay yeah
all right how apt that it is on youtube
the home of the alt-right
so
he says hello doctors this question if
you're just answering
for losing fat while maintaining muscle
aside from the psychological slash
adherence factor
since we're all hardcore here
is there any difference between a
lighter cut over a longer period of time
compared to a harsher cut over a shorter
period of time are there any best
practices for losing fat while trying to
keep as much muscle as possible
regarding the length and depth of the
cut so actually address this uh to a
huge extent in the renaissance diet 2.0
book talk about their trade-offs
but um
i will say that within a wide range
anywhere between i would say 8 and 14
weeks
you can contract or expand with roughly
the same effect
one notable difference stands out to me
is
how much current strength performance
are you interested in having
so if you're a power lifter for example
and your weight lifter your day to day
week to week performance matters you
can't just get the strength back later
it's too late and it'll reduce your
training quality during the time that
you don't have your strength
with those folks
diets that are much less aggressive are
a good idea and if you insist on losing
a lot of weight it has to be at a very
slow pace if you go fast with those diet
with those training modalities you're
just going to burn the fuck out
if you're a bodybuilder a little bit
different
but
generally speaking the risk to muscle
loss
exists probably
the short
intense diets a little bit more because
they tend to dip into your ability to
train hard
um
at that daily deficit it's just nasty
uh so that's how i would say there so
largely similar effects
but if you're trying to keep your
strength
um
i would say go slower
yeah and especially for weight class
sports like at that point you should be
keeping like a much tighter range on
your competition body weight so if you
find yourself having to lose a lot of
weight that means you're being a sloppy
fuck
you got to be better during your
non-competition period so you don't have
to do that um i want to kind of go to
the point where he said aside from the
psychology adherence factor since we're
all hardcore here
being hardcore has nothing to do with
like making choices based on psychology
right like you can absolutely pick
rates and lengths that best suit your
own needs at any given time which might
be a little bit variable so i don't
think that you have to necessarily throw
away the psychology and just say oh
we're all hardcore so which one's the
best it's like no that should factor in
that should factor into a well thought
out you know a periodized plan saying
like well you know i might go a little
harder at this time because i have a
little bit more um life mrv some more
free space to dedicate to training and
other times i might not maybe i'm going
to stretch it out a little bit longer
and go a little bit lighter so it's not
as disruptive all of those things should
factor in so um
i just don't i just don't like framing
it as like hardcore psychology doesn't
matter it absolutely does matter and
it's it's okay to say like this suits my
my mental needs as well and there's no
shame in that
[Music]
and if you're pushing the rest of your
life hard if you're really hardcore
psychology matters again because we're
all finitely able
and if you make something easier it can
allow you to push harder on other things
absolutely
all right next up is the one right down
there
spicy
says hey docs thanks for all the great
content over the years do you have any
tips or strategies for situations where
you cannot count calories effectively i
work in a remote camp where all the food
is prepared for us usually just a couple
dishes to choose from
it's mostly fine when i'm massing just
make sure to get enough protein with
waste casein and eat quarter quart
now i want to cut and it's hard to know
what the hell i'm eating i've been
trying to unregulate just using hunger
and a scale for rolling weekly average
weight but the results have oscillated
between weight coming off much too
quickly and barely at all when i try to
compensate for that
thanks
um yeah yeah i
my only tips are to try to eat a core of
protein
and to really note
how much serving size of stuff you put
on your plate uh let's say if you were
to do this again during maintenance or
massing note the serving sizes
when you begin cutting keep the protein
servings the same and just take the carb
slash fat i'm assuming like mac and
cheese or casserole or some shit just
take the gobs of that
and make them one-third smaller
or
half the size
that should put you on a good course and
then you can adjust from there yes the
weight will oscillate but uh you know
somewhere between weight coming off too
quickly and barely at all is an amount
of food that will get you there with
oscillations but on average will result
so that's my best advice i think
yeah that's really good advice i've
worked with a couple clients who were
military personnel who worked in you
know
you know
international bases and they often had
to eat in a mess hall and one of the
things that we would do is just exactly
as dr mike said sometimes you just have
to look at how much you know is on your
plate and then just slowly reduce that
eyeballing it the best that you can one
thing that i have had people do is when
they have an opportunity like if they
come back stateside or if they get into
a bigger city or they can amazon
something is to just get a food scale
and just weigh how much food you're
eating at that point right so if you
have a plate that's full of your kind of
normal stuff kind of get a baseline
average of like how much does it kind of
weigh and then start using just less
overall weight that's something you can
also do which is a slightly more
quantitative version of eyeballing it
i hope your training is good over there
a lot of the kind of training you can
get in a situation like that
i mean at a remote camp or like a
military thing
both
i know like a lot of the military folks
um they say like it depends on what
you're doing over um seas but like a lot
of them who
just work on a base they say like yeah
you got a lot of free time so we just
work out a lot and they don't have a ton
of stuff but it'll just be like some
some barbells and dumbbells kind of
stuff and
a lot of them say they get a lot of
workout time if they want
all right christina is up next
christina says hi docs i was wondering
why certain body parts tend to get
stored more easily than others obvious
answer would be not hitting any dmae for
that body part larger muscle groups
versus smaller ones we're not
incorporating exercises with stretch
under load but this doesn't seem to be
the case for me
to make it more concrete i never
experienced any muscle soreness in my
back while my other muscle groups
experience muscle coroners on a regular
basis however i'm making comparable
progress in my back lifts as my other
lift
and i protract my shoulders when i
machine row dumbbell rows that i get the
stretch under load
does this mean my personal background
could be higher than the other muscle
groups
in ratio with already different
prescribed volume requirements as laid
out in our piece of landmarks articles
or maybe something with a composition of
the muscle fibers itself i'd love to
hear your thoughts about this thanks
again for all that you do docs so it
could be all those things
maybe our mrv is much higher
maybe your muscle fiber composition and
your back on average is slower twitch
what i would say also is that most of
the back muscles are anatomically unable
to be stretched very far
so like unless you do one arm lat pulls
like this
which almost nobody does you're never
stretching your lats very far it's not
surprised they don't get very sore
um
your
scapular control muscles
almost never get stretched an amount
that you would consider significant
especially if you look at how short they
are to begin with and how not long they
become when they get stretched
so already the back you know it's not
like your triceps like especially if you
go overhead like this your triceps will
be stretched so far that like fuck like
as far as they'll go your quads you can
feel the maximum stretch with no load if
you do a full deep squat
but with the back it's a little tougher
um
but
being that so first of all being that
you're making good gains
i wouldn't change a whole lot but if
you're making good gains you never get
sore i'd say you know try to up your
volume a little bit here and there and
see if you can get even better games
um
yeah james
yeah i've had a similar problem
traditionally like my my back just
doesn't really get very sore and i still
make progress the only times i will get
like sore lats for example would be like
on a peak week when i train you know
pretty much at failure or really close
to failure that'll be the only time or
ironically if i did like a really heavy
set of straight leg deadlifts then my
lats will be sore ironically uh yeah
right um so in that case like mike said
i think just keep doing what you're
doing if your training is going well and
you're making good progress you might
consider adding some more isolation
movements for any of the specific
muscles that you're really trying to hit
like one thing that i've found is that
um adding things like lat prayers as
they're called or like i call them
straight arm cable lats yeah yeah yeah
it's one that um you can bang out a lot
of volume you can do different
techniques you can do like metabolite
style you can do mile reps you can do
all sorts of wacky shit with something
like that and that has really made a big
progress in my perception of soreness
and disruption on my back training
because i also have this problem um so i
would consider adding some more
isolation stuff you might find that for
like the scapular retractors you might
be doing kind of lame more shrugging
type stuff but hey if it gets the job
done then great and if you're still
making good progress overall it wouldn't
change a whole lot it might just be
either adding a little bit more volume
than you're used to or maybe adding some
additional isolation exercises in there
that might be all you need to do
also
sorry uh just just a one thing to i know
mike's really good about
talking about this but just a friendly
reminder like soreness itself is not
necessarily the outcome that you want to
chase it's a good little proxy that lets
you know that you did something probably
did something well hopefully not overdid
it so
um the goal is not to be sore so much as
the goal is to either grow preserve
muscle or make gains in strength um so
if you know if you're checking those
boxes then you're largely on the right
track the soreness is more of a proxy
kind of thing not necessarily the
outcome i'm glad you mentioned the lap
prayers straight on lat pulldowns
um
they fucking destroy me bro i'm so glad
i started doing them yeah
yeah i see so it's funny like i know
we've already talked about this on a
previous one but if you guys watch
videos of dr mike doing the lat prayers
and then you see a video of me doing it
because of our body size differences we
have very distinct technique differences
in how we do it you might think like how
could it be that different it's an
isolation movement but you'd be
surprised like if you have gumby arms
like me and you're a little more stout
like mike you might have to do it a
little bit differently so christina
going back to your question that's
another thing to play around with too
where you might find that
um certain
certain techniques might be better for
you than
that like for me like for example like
close grip underhand pulldowns is one of
the only ones that make my lats sore
where other people like maybe they don't
feel it at all um and then playing
around with different grips and
modifications on your technique
sometimes can make a world of difference
for back
josh is up next just josh i don't know
how the fuck he got that name but that's
pretty gosh
he said watch revive stronger episode of
brad schoenfeld he was mentioning
partial reps in the stress position
having good hypertrophy stimulus in
relation to team full rom what are your
thoughts on
if when and where it has a place in
programming training do you speak on
behalf of team forum i guess
so uh a couple things before i give a
decent answer to josh team full rom it's
just that it's a name like it's kind of
tongue-in-cheek um
it's a fun thing to call our little
squad there
and we're not married to any training
ideology
it's just that most of the people that
think
they train hard avoid obviously
beneficial range of motion and that
makes us happy to feel superior to them
so
yes one study has showed that stretch
position has better hypertrophy stimulus
and the full range of motion in leg
extensions
and that's very interesting and it also
uh fits in well with the idea that
stretch under load has been hypothesized
and demonstrated as a very good
hypertrophic stimulus for a long time
now
so
thoughts on if
when and where it has a place in
programming and training
so
the if is potentially
the when is any time you want to
experiment with it to see if it gives
you a good stimulus to fatigue ratio and
the where is that the gym
at the gym
um but yeah no it's a totally fine
experiment with the only thing i would
say is make sure that when you're
experimenting to see if it has a good
stimulus to fatigue ratio try to
standardize it as much as possible slash
track it as well as you can so that
you're not doing partials that are
arbitrarily distanced
and you just have no idea how to
replicate the effort because you could
have done partials at a certain range
one week and it got a great response and
the next week you accidentally cut the
range by a little bit or by a lot and
you just don't know because you're never
tracked and all of a sudden you get
almost no response but you don't know
why because you're still partials but
how much total physical work did you do
easy in a partial to cut it by half
barely notice and the work has been
halved as well so the stimulus is much
less so i'd say try to track it in some
way
um
you know another interesting thing you
can do is like
let's say you're doing an exercise like
dips
and you're doing a chest lean forward
for a lower chest what you may be able
to do is dip until
you're just above the hard part of the
dip not locked out and then come back
down dip until just above the hard part
come back down that's a good way to do
it you could do the john meadows style
hack squats or leg presses or you go
all the way down come back halfway all
the way down come back all the way and
then repeat that cycle essentially jams
double the
low rate of the lower portion reps as it
does full round reps into your training
so there's ways to do it i would just
encourage you to do it in such a way
that it can be standardized and thus
tracked and
evaluated and assigned logically because
a lot of guys will do partials and just
like
it's like how many did you do there i
don't know bro they're sure to trash it
i don't count shit so
james what do you think
yeah i'm not like fundamentally against
uh the partial reps it's just that they
always devolve into fuckery right that's
where the problem lies it's not that
like the partial reps is inherently like
the problem it's that just people just
do dumb shit so i think you can do it in
a productive way my thing always is like
um
if you're doing if you're doing partial
reps because you think it's hitting like
the muscle or a different
part you know a different muscle group
in a unique way
my thing is would always be can i just
get this effect by doing another
exercise uh that i haven't really played
around with yet um and can i do that in
like a reproducible way
if the answer is yes do the latter
if not
and you feel like you're really getting
something unique out of this partial
range of motion that you really haven't
found anywhere else or can't think of a
way to get it anywhere else then that's
fine but what drives me nuts is well
here's a good example we're kind of
similar to what the example might get
sometimes i'll see people do like high
bar style squats they squat all the way
down and then they do like partials at
the bottom like third
right and you're kind of like what are
you doing they're like well i'm turning
my glutes and it's like well you could
train your glutes in a much
easier way in a much more direct way um
than that and that's i don't know that
that just seems ridiculous
so that would be kind of my take on it
there's probably like for for everything
that a partial does like there's
probably a like a just more standard
full range of motion technique which in
my opinion is going to be more
reproducible and easier to track
so that would tend to go that direction
all right next up is
a telon
what the fuck
all right give me enough give me a
control f yeah
t-a-l-o-n
[Music]
there we go
boom talon that's a sweet fucking name
does he says hey docs when someone
builds their maximally desired muscle
mass let's say their peak natural
potential
and want to then maintain it and go on
with their life can they train at
slightly higher rir's five four three
two
rather than lower rers three two one
zero in a typical four-week motorcycle
for example still maintain their muscle
training at mv and mev
so it's actually mv training that you'll
have to do but if you train 5432 rer
your maintenance volume is just going to
be like maybe one or two sets higher
than it would be if you're training
harder that's it
yeah that's literally it so there's kind
of an inverse relationship between the
the volume landmarks and intensity so
like if you choose a lower intensity
then you just need a little bit more
volume um
that's really this is the trade-off
there the funny thing is like if you
really want to train so i usually the
the goal with maintenance volume
training is to do less training overall
so in that case it's actually good to
train at you know heavier weights and
relatively high um all right well
relatively low rirs because then you
only have to do like two sets and you're
done
you can just call it a day um but yeah
either way's fine
all right next up is a gentleman
just
down from
helen
i
i'm not reading that shit
oh boy
cruise ship oh that's good uh maybe
that's just me russianifying it all
right kuru says crazy seek
crazy think
kuruzrik means little circle in russian
i'm sure that's not his name um
all right hey doctors i have a question
about long time training effects to be
more precise it's about joints at what
level of strength should you
consider not getting stronger slash not
using heavy weights if you plan to train
your whole life if not uh not only a few
years it's a good question my best guess
would be
if you have workouts
frequently
in which you're like oh fuck my joints
because you know like right james i can
powerlifting and like i totally get like
kickboxing jiu jitsu like that shit
happens all the time it's not
sustainable it's dumb so but if you have
normal weight training workouts where
you get a great muscle pump your joints
feel better afterwards that's where i
would stop so again so you notice like
anything north of 300 pounds on the
squat your knees really start taking a
beating you've tried to go heavier it's
just always the knees but anything just
south of that feels great then just
don't go above 300. right it sounds lame
but uh that's really the cutout is it's
kind of like we all start lifting
with all sorts of expectations and some
of us honor the idea that it's supposed
to be good for your body but like i've
done competitive powerlifting you know i
was in a position where i remember one
time
between two sets of low bar squats
i had 10 minutes of like ice packs on my
elbows because that's how much they
fucked on my elbows yes and i was like
this is dumb so
i still did it so uh yeah that would be
like you know if your joints
consistently hurt james do you have
anything to add to that because i don't
i don't know
yeah i mean that's like the obvious one
it's like when it's
you stop doing it when it's just causing
you pain all the time right um so we
talk a little bit about this in the
hypertrophy book but one thing that we
do use is kind of as a as a proxy for
some of this is training age and so one
of the things that we recommend is as
your training age starts to increase
from you know intermediate to late to
advanced we actually start to see a
shift in the kind of rep ranges that you
use because we find that you really just
can't sustain doing five to ten
all that time and then as you move into
kind of like the more masters advanced
level we see a little more heavy
reliance on that moderate to higher rep
range but then also intensification
techniques like pre-fatigue for example
where instead of having to load up 405
pounds on the squat you might do some
pre-fatigue stuff so you can still get a
good robust stimulus without having to
use quite as much weight so there's kind
of workarounds around it um but yeah the
obvious is the answer is the one dr mike
gave where it's just like when it when
it causes you pain and existential dread
that's probably a good time to call it
but just you know when you start you
becoming um a more advanced trainee we
start leaning on those moderate to
higher rep ranges and intensification
techniques to lower the absolute load of
a lot of the lifts that you have to do
all right i'm next actually a gentleman
right south of that shitty daddy daddy
or shakespeare sorry
i think you were right shake
all right he says could you guys go into
more details about training at 40
or after 48 yes
uh actually the greek trojan
probably answered this question as well
as possible with this first
thing
uh the training for your age video
explains some of the differences 40
minute blog video whatever wanted i
wanted to know what realistic
expectations and muscle growth and fat
loss rates are
what mechanisms cause the difference in
the extra considerations recovery and
injury professionals thanks always so
it's a very good question shake um
so i'll tell you what we can't answer
realistic expectations of muscle growth
and fat loss rates because that data
first of all doesn't exist and second of
all if it existed it would be a normal
normally distributed about the
population of people that do it so it
would have almost no relevance to you as
a person so for example like um
james uh used to train this uh one lady
we we uh lovingly referred to as
crossfit grandma
and uh she was a literal grandmother
and just didn't really participate in
any kind of sports whole life and looked
like an old person and after like two
years of training crossfit had like
unreal muscle bellies separations and
full six-pack in like her 60s
like but we are not all crossfit grandma
so if you told her hey listen don't
bother training it's you're just going
to get fucked up she said have been like
okay and she'd have done it she'd be
like ah
she's choking wolverine with one hand
and hulk with the other so that's
definitely like so on the other hand
there are people that like
do i put this nicely there are people
that in their late teens and early 20s
gain approximately zero muscle mass
despite all their best efforts
sorry james you picked their shitty time
to take a drink out of that
james is laughing because he knows it's
true if you read the research literature
actually some of the studies break it
down by individual or they have a
scatter plot and i got 16 weeks of
resistance training this guy gained
negative muscle
dexa confirmed he just lost muscle the
whole time
it happens right so he was just
overreaching the whole time
right i guess
that would be the only like that would
be a good thing for him because it's
like look your gen x aren't terrible you
actually just super low volume ultra
responder you just do a set in a set a
week and it'll be amazing right like so
ten sets it was like he only needed one
set and so 10 was already like all the
way across nine past mrb diminishing
returns
into negative yep
so yeah hopefully that's the case so i
will say though
realistic expectations
as as i said in that in the other big
video for the training age it really
depends on you know when you start
training so if you started training in
your teens
after roughly like age 45 you just
you're just going to lose muscle all the
time
slowly and then in your 70s not so
slowly
so that's point one now if you start in
your
in your 30s you can gain until maybe
you're 50. if you start in your 40s you
can gain into your late 50s if you start
in your 50s you can gain into your 60s
if you start in your 60s you can get
into your 70s if you start in your 70s
you can get into your 80s right
but the gains relatively will be smaller
again we can't put numbers on them
because those numbers just simply don't
exist with making things up
as far as mechanisms
i can think of at least a few
one is your body is not designed to heal
wear and tear
at a fundamental complete level
you are designed as a sexually
reproducing orgasm with an average
mating span of about 15 years
so
your body gives you the good old
you're going to run pretty well until
you're about 30.
and then it's actually
in part designed to
and in part not designed to prevent
the dilapidation of structures and
mechanisms over time
like if your genetics were slightly
different
uh you could continue to have
essentially in
a young body for 200 years no problem
but there's a lot of shit your body just
doesn't give a fuck about when it breaks
it just doesn't heal so for example
every time you tear a muscle your body
connects the two parts of the muscle
with scarcity scar tissue is
non-functional it's not designed to be
functional takes up mass it takes up
weight and it just connects them you
think like isn't that like
if i break a shelf i just like take a
piece of cardboard and nail it in and
call it good like
that's all your body needs is for you to
run around the plasticine for a while
fuck a few more people raise a few kids
to send my adulthood and get killed by a
mammoth
like you don't need to be a hundred
percent all the time and it's it's why
do you have all this muscle anyway
what are you doing oh what are you doing
you just go get killed um so a lot of it
is
not really so much a mechanism but a
lack of a mechanism to fix things well
and in shooting left in the laboratory
they're altering genes and animals now
and getting complete healing but they
have to alter genes to do that um
there's an uh so another thing growth
hormone levels fall as you age that's
certainly a factor so does testosterone
it's a refactor in women estrogen
certainly a factor all those things are
anabolic some of them in a facilitating
role some of them in a primary drive
role um
there are
muscle fiber conversions age so your
faster switch fibers actually convert to
slower twitch fibers which hasn't fairly
figured out is not really great for
hypertrophy not bad for endurance
however
uh and about a hundred trillion other
mechanisms all of which
uh just lead to just poor outcomes right
um here's another one probably in
association with growth hormone you
sleep less the older you get and less
sleep means less recovery so if there's
a reason when your kid is two he sleeps
18 fucking hours a day and he like
doubles his body weight in a year like
yeah you gotta sleep like that deep too
crazy ass dreams you know kids little
kids are asleep sometimes you can like
throw a fucking canister close to their
head and they don't even wake up you're
like what the fuck is going on pure
unreal
body change anabolism you think if i put
you in 18 units of growth hormone you
would sleep like that too you would live
very long but you would be pretty jacked
so
that kind of thing is is where a lot of
the differences come from
as far as extra considerations for
recovery and injury prevention i'd say i
have two at least right now that i think
i probably said on the in the video but
i think they're really they're repeating
if you're still interested
recovery
assume you can do a lot less than you
think until proven otherwise through
very easy scaling
injury prevention don't do anything you
think is remotely stupid
so for example
like if you're older and you want to do
jiu jitsu the rest of your life stop
standing up with people same time you
stand up there's a chance you're getting
thrown down the shit's gonna break just
start from
guard
in in the gym there's always that one
wrapper that set or that session where
you're like i shouldn't fuck it don't do
anything like that when you're older
when you're younger there's a good
chance you'll get hurt but you'll be
fine or not fine it'll just ruin the
rest of your life
but you're young and dumb who gives a
shit when you're older i think james and
i have a similar view on this
we're much more
disappointed when older clients and
people they consult do stupid shit
because you know when you're 18 or 19
whatever i'm saying yolo
when you're 51 and you're like oh i felt
like benching today and
i was still sore but i felt my tweak in
my back what do you think like what do i
think well it doesn't matter what i
think i can tell you for a fact i do
think and i can't tell you that you
think because seemingly you weren't
thinking at all
so shit like that is probably the best
advice
james
yeah really good across the board so um
mike already kind of explained this but
uh you know with the aging stuff this is
not a perfect way of thinking about it
but i think it answers kind of a lot of
these basic questions you know with
aging really what we see after you know
40 ish for men
people say like how much muscle how much
this and that it's really all we're
talking about is like your maximum
natural potential starts to go down so
that means if you are somebody who is
already flirting with your natural
potential you only got one direction to
go but if you're a beginner or somebody
who's taken some significant time off
and you're nowhere near that limit you
can absolutely make gains at that time
right can you make as much magnitude of
gains over the course of your life
probably not that ship has kind of
sailed but really the way that you want
to think about it is like um just like
your net your maximum natural potential
starts to go down over time so you can
still absolutely make progress in a lot
of these things um in terms of recovery
injury prevention so microarray nailed
it but if you were to take you know
training plan of you in your 20s and
then look at training plan of you now
both of them were well thought and put
together
more likely than not your overall
volumes are going to be a little bit
lower and your maybe your frequency that
you train certain muscle groups per week
or do certain activities per week is
probably a little bit lower probably on
the scale of maybe one less time per
week maybe maybe not you can certainly
derive these things the same way
regardless of how old you are but if i i
am a betting man and i lost
i made two of five bets on the ufc this
weekend so i made five bets i only only
actually got two but i actually came out
making money how about that hey
right so go figure that out where did
you lose your money i'm curious uh let's
see so i uh i did a throwaway bet on
roxanne mata fairy uh because she has
cashed as an underdog a couple times um
and it was her retirement fight but she
was like plus or yeah she was like plus
300 or 400 so it was like a really juicy
deal i bet that orlovsky would lose he
ended up winning
uh
i forgot the other one
but i won on adasanya by decision and i
won on tuivasa
so there did you figure to bet on suiva
lewis
hasn't been looking that great lately he
also has struggled competing in his
hometown tuivasa was on like a five
five knockout streak um and he was like
plus 200 so with the heavyweights
there's so much volatility in that
weight class like anybody can kind of
win when you see a big when you see a
big um lopsided in in the betting odds
like if you see somebody who's got a
plus 200 or more it's kind of like why
not
you can make a lot of money yeah it's
like one of those like well one of
them's gonna get knocked out so i don't
know we'll see right um i lost my train
off oh betting uh yeah so i was saying
i'm a betting man and um yeah i would
just bet that
uh
your frequencies and volumes would be
just a little bit lower than than when
you were at your prime uh in terms of
other things definitely pain is your
enemy so if you're if this is this is
kind of what i think what mike was
getting at two where it's like if
whatever you're doing whatever sport or
training you're doing you're like oh i'm
not not feeling it today or am i kind of
sore i'm kind of her my elbows bother me
just stop move on do something else
pain-free
the number one thing that you have to
prevent is working through pain like
when you're a dipshit 20 year old you
can work through a lot of pain and just
shrug it off when you're over 40 when
something hurts
stop doing it find something else you
can do pain-free even if it's like a
significant deviation away from your
training plan like if you're like i'm
supposed to hit
this these leg press numbers today this
is my peak week but my warm up sets my
knees are already fucking hurting on
this leg press fuck it do something else
yeah
oh god i just pulled out like a two foot
long dog hair out of my mouth jesus
it's like
gross
all right up next is
[Music]
please fall down a little bit
right there
ibrahim
[Music]
let's take him
nice
all right
he asks hey guys i've got the usual
question about alcohol but it's short
it's short but i find it very
interesting here's a hypothetical person
a is at maintenance training hard and
smart he or she abstains from alcohol
consumption person b is it a slight
surplus training hard spot his or her
surplus calories are entirely made up of
ethanol who's building more muscle
how valuable can the calories from hard
liquor be if they generate the surplus
of an otherwise healthy and sustainable
diet well so i'll uh i'll just say it's
not gaining any muscle first of all no
muscle because you're at maintenance
congratulations
person b is at maintenance but he's also
poisoning himself with alcohol so i'd
say person b would lose more muscle than
person a
yeah so i'm trying to think i'm trying
to do some mental math in my head so
you're saying he's person b is trying to
you he's trying to get their weekly
calorie surplus from alcohol
so
let's just let's just call let's just
play it like 250 calories per day
folks
that's a lot of alcohol that's a lot of
alcohol that's a lot that's normally
like when we get the alcohol question i
assume like reasonable drinking habits
and i would say probably not a big deal
but that's a lot that's like a
that's a substantial amount of alcohol
yeah you're probably losing muscle at
that point
let me see your life is probably in
disarray at that point
each beverage
and then define the united states any
beverage containing
14 grams of pure alcohol is a standard
drink
so
let's say we do
150 surplus
that is almost 11
shots
of vodka
per per day
how many calories are in one shot
oh sorry i did grams good god i fucked
that up i was like wait a minute that
can't be right
so seven
cal so 250 calories
divided by seven calories per gram
oh okay jk
two and a half two and a half shots
for 250 calorie surplus per day you know
so okay
there is a potential way in which if you
had this alcohol
it would delay
the burning of your other calories and
you would have a net surplus
and you would gain weight um so i guess
person b probably
although it depends on how hard it was
gaining
uh
so so here's the
thing um
yeah i take back my old answer person b
would gain more i mean here's why
his or her surplus calories are entirely
made up of ethanol
that actually is um
it's phrased accurately in the way of
asking the question but physiologically
that's not how it works
your surplus can't be made up of any one
particular thing
it's like saying
you know it's like having soup at a
certain level in a bowl and then pouring
in more water and saying see it's the
water that's making it go up like yeah
but it's all mixed together now
so in the context of two to three shots
of vodka per day
but having a surplus can you gain more
muscle than maintenance yes i would say
the answer is yes
yeah um but that would be we would
definitely be seeing diminishing returns
as a result of alcohol consumption at
that at that level um maybe not negative
returns but certainly diminishing
returns
there you go ibrahim
uh the other thing too is that you know
like if you're thinking about
two and a half shots per day's worth
right but most people don't drink every
day so then it's gonna that becomes like
five shots every other day right or you
know
seven and a half you know i've done
three times per week
it gets into some wild territory where
where the peaks and valleys might
actually
play a more significant role depending
on how that alcohol is actually dosed
per week that's just kind of a funny
thought experiment
all right last up last question for
today is eric matthews
eric matthews got it
all right let me uh read this really
quick
i have too many fucking tabs open
oh my
big doc boys
sorry i should read this as t as he
wrote it
big doc boys
it's all caps all caps is yelling right
yeah
do our bodies have a certain weight size
slash fat percentage slash muscularity
they want to sit at yes
in other words when we train or die with
a goal of muscle gain slash fat loss
from our baseline is our body resisting
that change to some degree yes
increasingly so as you get farther away
from when you started definitely my
example before lifting or structuring my
diet i was 135 skinny no muscles slight
visible ab definition
i assume this is around what i would
still be if i never picked up weights
and maybe close to that
over four or five years of training i
bulked up to 180 this wasn't all muscle
and my fattest damn definition had just
gone past being visible but definitely
was much more va muscular so around 20
body fat i sat around 80 for around a
year then in december 2020 over the
course of two weeks i lost 15 pounds
unexplainably
so when you go to the doctor
i didn't change my training or diet i
was having sleep apnea problem
but i don't think that's enough for 15
pounds in two weeks
i even went to the doctor and had tests
run nothing found that's very good
could that just be my body telling me
i'm supposed to be a skinny 135 pound
rail and not enough of being 180
couldn't handle it i'm sitting around
162 now still training from us again
like i always have
i
james take a crack hit it so yeah i have
a hard time with this one because my
skeptical side always comes out so when
oh yes
right so we don't just lose 15 pounds
unexplainably and forgive my skepticism
uh eric matthews but i think more than
likely you did change your diet unless
you were meticulously prepping each one
of your meals because you were doing
like for example a muscle gain diet
phase or something like that if you were
just kind of eating as you normally do
the more likely answer is that you were
just eating less than you normally do um
i don't really
the discussion kind of ends there for me
i don't really know where to go after
that mike what do you think
so
you know eric
maybe you were tracking your diet
precisely
maybe you were tracking your activity
precisely
if you were not tracking them precisely
and cannot nearly guarantee that they
didn't change
they are the most likely things that
changed so that you lost 15 pounds
another factor in losing 15 pounds over
two weeks
almost certainly has to involve body
water flux that's pretty large
because uh you you're just not going to
lose that much tissue in two weeks i
mean jesus
you know so well let's run the numbers
on that
that's one pound per day
so that's
you had to be at a 3 500 calorie deficit
per day
at your body weight that would mean you
ate nothing
and still had a pretty high level of
physical activity every day
that did not happen
so my
thinking is you may have
lost some weight over some months before
but somehow increased your salt intake
or something like that or other health
conditions caused you to retain a lot of
water then over the period of two weeks
you drop that retained water that's my
best guess
it's a shot in the dark
uh
it's almost certainly not your body
telling you you're supposed to be skinny
because your body will if you eat
normally go back slowly towards where
you're supposed to be or somewhere
between that and where you have been for
a while
but gee that takes a long time and it
would reflect itself in your diet for
example
uh you know i'm currently weighing like
you know 240 to 250 somewhere 245 let's
say
if i
you know came off all the special sports
ups because they drive my appetite up
pretty high
and i just ate whatever i wanted
relatively healthy of course
i would start to not so slowly
drift towards being less than 200 pounds
that being said i would be eating
significantly less
because my hunger is so reduced i'd be
eating way way less than it would feel
totally normal
so that's how that presents itself when
you're being dragged down
to your old body weight it's you know it
would have to
a physical activity change or eating
change would be the thing that would
cause that
um and it would hurt right like you
would be suffering
that's a huge amount of weight to lose
like if you've ever done a weight loss
diet and you've gotten
towards the end of a like of a long
series of weight loss like it every
every last little quarter of a pound is
just pain
so that's where i think mike and i are
kind of skeptical you know also could be
medication like maybe you had got put on
medication and that caused your water
body water content to shift a little bit
that's a completely plausible
explanation
um yeah maybe you had like a giant
anaconda size shit that you forgot about
that you took
dude one of my slap shit
where you sleepwalk to the toilet and
take a dump
one of my uh clients had that happen uh
the person's weight was elevated for
like two or three days and then was like
mate i had like a four kilogram shit
or like four kilograms worth of shit
over like a couple days he like released
the kraken he fucking broke the shit
seal and then just unloaded for a few
days
so our dog
gwen she's an old english bulldog
um my wife was out of town she was
actually the
sports medicine doctor for teen usa
figure skating she was usa
usa usa she yelled out at everyone she
saw it as as i instructed her too
so she was out of the country when when
he was getting her spain surgery so she
got her ovaries taken out
don't worry i made a joke to the veteran
areas when i dropped her off i was like
i'd like her back just the way except no
ovaries
yeah a few of them giggled at that the
rest probably thought it was like sir
but in any case get out of here
she
i it was stayed overnight at the animal
hospital i picked her up in the morning
she had the cone of shame and everything
but she seemed very tripper see i've
never seen before she got mega surgery
major surgery it's like it didn't affect
her very fucking hardly at all i was
what the fuck jumped into the car like
normal holy shit i'm supposed to be
lifting you into things don't jump
didn't no perception of pain
came home and i was like you know they
feed them at the animal hospital eat
them but they have to do a little bit of
a
cleaning out starvation thing before the
surgery so like the night before no food
morning no food
brought her back home
and took on a little walk
and uh you know she didn't she peed she
didn't poop or anything i was like okay
brought her back in it was it wasn't
time to eat yet because i picked her up
mid morning and they say they feed them
so i assume that she ate in the morning
and she's just like look at me and
everyone watch you walk with me and i
was like okay fuck
fine do you want some food i started
ruffling the food bag she was like
she usually has one cup of food per meal
i gave her three and a half total cups
of food because she just kept eating it
finishing and looking at me i was like
fuck it more food you know she's
recovering from surgery here on the side
of more
three and a half cups of food later and
like a gallon of water
what are these people doing this dog is
fucking starving to death i'm thirsty as
fuck
um
instantly wants to go back outside takes
like 10 she took three shits in a row
outside
like
walk poop walk poop and then she slept
for like four hours woke up and did the
same thing like two more times she shot
like eight times in a 24-hour period i
was like oh my god just kept coming i
was like damn dude she must have been
fucking holding it in or three and a
half cups of food later it was
impressive i was poor girl she had big
poo poos
ooh big poopy lady that's what we asked
her she never responds to that question
it's the time of year where um the snow
is kind of thawing out here and so all
of the like poop is
coming it is emerging from the snow so
every time i walk outside i'm like oh
it's just like a melting poopsicle it's
gross
[Music]
you get to forget about it for a little
while
yeah it is everything's kind of rotting
anyway you know all the snow leaves and
all the leaves and grass that hadn't
like dried up over the winter it's like
mixed together
do your dogs ever get into the mud james
on your property
oh my god constantly
we don't even try to keep them clean
like they
love
coming
he's doing a thing now where he likes to
roll and other animals poop
that's his his jam uh they love the mud
and we have like three
seasonal streams and right now it's like
the fall like muck so it's just like all
the snow melt and all about just mud so
when we do little walks around they go
through all the streams and just get
covered in mud they love it i'll get on
this i'll drive the side by side around
the neighborhood and they'll stick their
heads out and it's just fucking
mud love it they stick their faces out
and they're like
yeah we take them together you wash them
if they're really dirty i'll give them a
bath um in my shower but we take them to
the groomers like once every four or
five weeks
and um
the groomers also have like um arctic
dogs so they're kind of elitist about it
and they always just kind of give us
that look of like what the fuck are you
doing with your dogs when we take them
in because they're like brown and nasty
and they have dreadlocks
i'm like dude we live outside of town
they're just like wild montana dogs at
this point
do you take out the moving showerhead
and wash your dogs in the shower
i know i just use like a um like a bowl
and just kind of wash them oh okay do
they deal with water okay or do they
look kind of meek a lot of dogs when you
wash them they're just like they feel
like they did something wrong
they they do okay kamina looks like a
fucking ratty little coyote when he's
wet right it's hilarious he's so skinny
ham doesn't really give a fuck she's
just like whatever
oh they're pretty good about the water
they're pretty good
all right well are we are we finished
for this one we're done that's it
all right well folks thank you so much
for your questions uh dr mike anything
you want to pitch anything going on
nope uh more youtube stuff i guess you
guys are on youtube listening to us got
all kinds of videos recorded
just a heads up again you know a lot of
times we record videos
three or four months before they're put
out so if you make a request hey can you
make a video about this i always jot it
down on my handy-dandy notebook but it
may be
years until we get to it but lots of
great content in the interim so stay
tuned for that
awesome i am working on our secret
project which we'll probably announce
relatively soon but for now it remains a
secret um that's it for me folks thanks
so much for the questions we appreciate
it as always make sure you guys
subscribe and we will see you next time
you
