a few reasons i think if someone says
it's only one reason usually they're
being reductionist or simplifying in my
case i'm a coach um in bodybuilding
specifically
you get taken a lot more seriously if
you've got experience competing and also
you have first-hand experience of what
it's like
and so when clients come to you you know
bothers come to you and they're like
12 weeks into call this prep you know
how it feels you know what it's like
um
and i think contest prep is quite
different from
most preparations for different sports
in that
you're starving yourself yeah and
starting yourself is quite different
from say
maxing out in the gym for palpitating
meat or happy it's more of a chronic
thing
more of a chronic stressor almost and so
part of it was her coaching
part of it was because i've never gone
that lean and so i wanted to see okay if
i get quite lean
how would i look
because it's one thing to see yourself
in the off
fat
yeah looking terrible but then you want
to see okay once a step on stage with a
tan with a pump with everything how do i
look um
it's just more of a curiosity thing i
guess
and then finally
i competed with halloween few years ago
and i enjoyed it but it wasn't
i didn't enjoy it enough for it to
become
my sole focus
and so
if i want to be the best coach i can be
if i want to
take lifting weights and this fitness
lifestyle the next level i want to
experience bodybuilding and see what it
has to offer if i enjoy it and
eventually ultimately i'm doing this
competition to get the experience if i
enjoy it i can then say okay the next
five to ten years mostly focused on
bodybuilding if i don't i know okay
maybe i should play some folks hospital
yeah that sounds good i definitely
i can see what you mean where you want
to coach with experience you know
and understanding what the athlete's
going through and today it's anyone can
kind of imagine what the hunger is like
but it's very different to how you can
imagine it and there's
if you understand the bound like you
understand the hurdles that they'll go
across you can help prevent that but
yeah definitely i think one thing is
up until you get to a certain body fat
or
down until there i guess
hunger and energy and everything are
pretty manageable like when you see
someone go from say 20 to 10 body fat
yeah usually pretty much well most of
the time they feel pretty good you know
they might even gain some strength in
some muscle and not be too hungry you
know just sort of leading an active
lifestyle
but then as you get lower and lower
eventually things get weird and later
and worse and worse and i think going
below that threshold and below that sort
of comfortable zone
is where having that competition
experience is helpful because if you
only ever died down to say 10 12
you know that's a pretty fun ride but
then when you get down to
a more conditioned level it's a
different beast entirely yeah
how's the prep been so far
so i've actually been prepping for
in some form nearly half a year
or something like that it's not always
been cutting i've had some maintenance
phases i've had one small walking slash
masking phase
but in some form i've been prepping for
half a year essentially
um
initially super easy as i mentioned when
you get down from like 20 10 it's a fun
ride you look better every day
performance is pretty much the same the
whole way or maybe it's slightly better
uh hunger is a non-issue usually
so first maybe 10 15 weeks very pleasant
very fun uh you know everyone gases you
up and gives you confidence on how good
you look how you've been losing weight
and
you know you start thinking oh this is
going to be pretty easy
but then i would say the last
sort of month out now i would say the
last five weeks or so i've been quite
rough um it's seemingly
around when i crossed ten percent body
fat for me it's gonna be different
person-to-person but for me
i would say the last like nine or ten
weeks of call this prep are gonna be
quite challenging overall
um
basically what's happened
leading aside the whole you know it
impacts relationships because we're
sociable um
it impacts your bodily functions
everything like that
it just makes you want to sit down and
eat which is the opposite of what you
want to be doing improves prep which is
move around and not eat
and so it's been
kind of like a
test of discipline habit formation and
willpower
where
what i want to do now is sit down and
eat
but instead i gotta walk around train
when i don't feel like at all and not
eat and so it's been challenging and i
think the last 10 weeks have been
the most challenging
has there been any hurdles specifically
like along the way
plenty so
i think one big one which doesn't get
mentioned enough
is maintaining relationships during
pulse prep
so
depending what your
social cycles are like
you'll probably have some friends who
are more into eating out or going out
and
a lot of
social activities revolve around eating
food
um
or if you're in contest prep
when you get towards the tail end of it
you have a choice to make
either you eat out
go pretty hungry because usually it's
not satiating
um and be more sociable
or you don't eat out be less sociable
straighten the relationships a little
bit
and be less hungry i think ultimately
you don't have to strike a balance at
different times in your prep initially
for example i could eat out most days
and still be fine
but now at this point it's a matter of
planning ahead
trying my best multiply impact
relationships
um that sort of thing
next would be
now at the point it's at it's starting
to impact my work in coaching as well so
in terms of focusing from a phd in terms
of focusing on my coaching
it already takes a lot of effort to just
get the steps in to just get the
training again to try not to think about
food
but then to also have to focus on you
know still being productive and not
letting the time go to waste just
because you're called this prepping you
know ultimately bodybuilding is a hobby
for
most of us
and so
if you can't also do your work
do your studying
then that's not a good situation to be
in because complex prep isn't like uh oh
prep for a few days then you're done
it's like a
few months
and so you don't want to let that time
go to waste
um
finally this is something i've
experienced mainly over the past month
or so and i expect like the last eight
weeks of prep
we're gonna see it happen pretty often
it's just an increased food focus and
increased like body image concerns
so in the off season i really wasn't a
person who was particularly concerned
with
body image like
i didn't really care too much what it
was like i enjoyed training um i thought
i'd taste physique and so forth
and likewise food was not really
concerned it was mostly a matter of
you know a box to take and have the
meals
whereas now it's gotten to a point where
body image wise
you know you think about your body a lot
more you check yourself out in there a
lot more um you're a lot more concerned
what you look like whether you're
leaning off this body part that body
part you start not being the most
objective person
again
um and i think that's why a lot of
people recommend getting a bodybuilding
coach in the first place because deeper
into prep the deeper you get the less
objective you become and the more biased
you become
and then
regarding
food focus
it's now going to the point where i
remember random instances in my life
where
oh i ate this food back then that was
tasty and just like when i close my eyes
and try to sleep
i just see random foods
and that's what i
so compare that with the performance
anxiety of oh
i'm stepping on stage in four weeks yeah
plus oh what does my body look like and
also oh remember that food we had that
was tasty
and overall it creates an environment
where you're pretty stressed out you're
pretty anxious
um
so i'd say those were the main
challenges so far
yeah
i know what we mean about that the food
like i had a dream like i was so i think
i was below 10 body fat just when i was
younger i used to diet i was like
shredded you know i think there is this
culture where if you're above 12 percent
body fat you're fat in fitness and it's
obviously yeah it's just like if your
abs are
slightly fluffy then
you you could never be a feminist
it's yeah it's quite a toxic it's very
toxic in fact and i just remember it's
only
you know it's only recently in the past
few years where i've actually
gotten over that but definitely from
like 16 to 18 my first two years of
training
i just was
i could never go above 12 i never even
could dream of going above 12. um
and there was one time where i was
dieting for like a long time
and it is like literally
i dreamt about food it sounds so crazy
but you
it's your life
and it does suck because if you're
before you're thinking about his food
you're not really present in the moment
and
and you do have to think about you know
the
lifestyle sacrifices that aren't
but also like
it's hard to explain to people who
aren't really prepping for a show yeah
and it sort of takes over your life in a
way and so you won't talk about it but
if you talk about
contest prep and your food focus on how
you dream about food and think about
food and think about your glutes and how
lean they are to other people um they
might just give you a blank stare and be
like
why are you telling me this again for
the whole time
which is understandable and it's also
trouble to
not let it consume your life there's
this whole thing in
bodybuilding evidence-based bodybuilding
where you need to make sure that
bodybuilding doesn't become your life
and consume it it needs to be a part of
your life and i think during contest
prep is when you're most
most prone and most at risk of letting
it consume your life and
getting into
trouble let's say
yeah
um
let's talk about the reddit
the reddit
and youtube on youtube instagram yeah
cross-platform how's it has it affected
you because obviously
maybe if one's not
deep into prep they can just shrug it
off but emotions are hydra and prep and
it's like
uh yeah it's it's definitely more
difficult for like
hormones or imbalance which can affect
your emotions a lot more so has it
affected you any differently recently
yeah so
when it's your first time prepping and
you also sort of lack confidence overall
in how you're doing whether you're ready
or not because that's the thing as well
the deeper you're going to prep the less
objective you are regarding
your how your body looks both your
posing your conditioning level your
muscularity and everything
and so if you're already unsettled about
what you look like and one day you think
you look pretty good but then one day
you think oh i look terrible like i
don't even lift um i can see how people
would be more
prone to
taking criticism
harshly
now with me specifically
um i did have one youtube comment that
said
i was too tall to be a good bodybuilder
um
but nevertheless
a natural athlete's always respectable
so it was mixed bag you know but we take
those and then i had one reddit thread
where um i was accused of being on juice
by some people at least most people were
like oh no this guy's naddy which was i
say this highly disappointing but you
know
we move
um
but yeah some comments were less
or
flattering to know this
and i'd say it has
impacted me somewhat ultimately i know
that for any physique to show anyone
there's always going to be some people
who are going to be like oh
you know you show
arnold's physique you could want to come
and see some people they're also going
to be like oh
triceps are lagging you know definitely
yeah so
and because i've been i think on the
giving end as well at some point in my
life regarding physiques regarding
any internet person ever yeah um i don't
take those comments too seriously i'm
sort of fortunate in that maybe it's
because i spend a few years playing
video games being quite active on
internet um but i just don't take those
comments too seriously
i'd say if it's someone who's opinion i
respect like i know them personally if
it's an anonymous comment court you
could be
uh jack 13 years old
push-ups in this room
never watch the boiling show and you
give comments oh i i don't really care
but if you're someone i know and who's
opinion of respect
that's a bit different but fortunately
like if you're someone i know
then you're reasonable enough to not be
um
yeah
i can't actually
yeah
i agree
so
pretty much gone for all from now let's
just kind of talk a little bit more
about the show now so
how are you feeling about the show
yeah so the show itself
um i've got a few different
trains of thought
the main one is let's get out with um
i've enjoyed a lot of this contest prep
but at the same time now where i'm at
now um
i want to see how i do
and i also want to get back to an
offseason realistically this is my first
show i'm not going to come in as
conditioned as i could ever be i'm also
not going to be as muscular as i can
ever be my posing isn't going to be
perfect
but i still want to see how i do just to
sort of set
a standard for myself in the future
should i compete again when i compete
again we'll see
secondly it's also like uh okay contest
prep has had all of this negative impact
on my life
it's time to
end it
do it properly and then get back to an
offseason get to a new normal
and spend a few years really improving
myself
potentially
taking an off-season to work on my weak
points which i fully intend on getting
the judge's feedback during that show to
make sure i can
say my conditioning was off or my posing
was off or my certain body parts were
off then i know it's working
so that's one of my trains of thought
another one is i'm
fairly nervous
um
obviously it's my first time sitting on
stage and so just the idea of being
fully tanned
being backstage and everything is sort
of surreal
um
but at the same time because i've got
some experience competing in
powerlifting and various sports
i know that when you're on stage you
don't see anyone you don't hear anything
really you're just doing your thing
it's all in a flash
and then you're off and then
competition's over and you're back to
normal
so i'm just gonna try and enjoy as much
as i can ultimately i
enter the competition and slowly call
this crap mostly for the experience not
to win
not to
achieve a certain standard or anything
just do my best and to see how i enjoy
it so in the future i can decide whether
or not i want to dedicate myself more so
to this
so yeah i'm going in with minimal
expectations we'll see what happens um
but i'll give my best
