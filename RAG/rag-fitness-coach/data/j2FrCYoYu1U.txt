all right welcome back you asked for it
so here's a video of how i make my meals
for my contest prep enjoy
in advance apologies for the lower
microphone quality than usual i was
recording in the kitchen and kitchens
get loud sometimes if you haven't seen
it already go check out the full day of
eating video i put out where you can see
all these meals
and the macros and calories and
everything for them
and then come back here
all right so as you can tell i just woke
up
and i'm about to have my first meal date
it's
so
one banana
250 grams berries
250 grams of fat for yogurt greek one
scoop of whey protein and five grams of
creatine monohydrate
and then i'll just add some water
all right and here we are that's about
100 grams of brown rice some chicken
breast mushrooms bean sprouts
garlic onion black pepper salt
soy sauce
and that's it i i forgot to show it but
i did something called a wet brine on my
chicken breast a wet brine is basically
when you submerge
your meat in
a solution of water and salt or sugar
and or sugar
and or some sort of acid like for
example lemon juice
and that's what i did i submerged the
chicken in water and added four percent
of salt
it just makes the chicken move on to a
bit more moisture it softens it a little
bit
and it also obviously makes it salty so
honestly it just makes the consistency
and texture of chicken breast
a lot better in my opinion so
if you've never wet brand your chicken
try submerging it in water with start
with a four percent salt concentration
um
so if you have
1000 grams of water then 40 grams of
salt is a good start
try wet brightening it and let in how it
goes all right so i'm going to get
started by adding in some
olive oil
and then
taking the wet brine chicken
removing the water and adding them into
the pan
all right so a couple things first of
all when you first get into the pan be
careful because a
they're gonna
splash fair amounts especially with
higher heats which is what i'm using
because
i like time efficiency
um so a be careful because it's gonna
splash a little bit and spit the oil
around
and b
um
be careful it doesn't stick chicken
breasts pretty low fat especially
skinless
so you want to be careful it doesn't
stick to the pan and start burning
but then
after around a minute or after
the chicken breast goes white typically
that means
it's not going to stick anymore unless
you really
don't pay attention to it for a long
time so just be careful at first
also you'll notice right now the chicken
breasts don't actually fit into the pan
like as in
one of them for example on top of the
rest
now initially that might be an issue but
as the chicken breasts
cook and lose water they're going to
shrink and eventually there should be
enough space to roughly have every
chicken breast
down on the pan
which then allows it to round
so even if initially there's not quite
enough space for
all the chicken breasts to be exposed to
the surface of the pan don't worry just
be patient
no browning is going to take place
initially anyways because it's too early
and the meat isn't warm enough or cooked
enough etc
so just be patient a couple of things
one tip
lipstick you can rest pretty often
there's no hormone being so and just
make sure that you don't do anything
and another thing is even if you see
some browning at the bottom don't worry
about it because we'll add in some
mushrooms afterwards which will lose
water and you can just scrape it off and
pick lasers
[Music]
so as you can see
some of these pieces approach ground
quite nicely so once you get about this
brown you can finally
burning quite quickly
keep flipping around make sure the other
side is burning
and then because no pan has like
perfectly even
once they're finished take them out and
keep the other ones and fill it down as
well
i think maybe a little bit more grinding
than this is good
but any more than that you start
whisking
while the chicken finished cooking take
your mushrooms slice them up small
pieces
and then add them to the pan all right
now that these are chopped
add them to the pan
as you can see there's some browning and
fall under the pan the good news is
these mushrooms are going to release a
lot of water
sorry
a lot of water and then once they do you
can scrape off the bottom and deglaze it
so
all right now that the mushroom's been
palm
same thing as for chicken where
initially there's nothing enough space
for them all to get round because then
as they shrink there will be
keep an eye on them and as soon as it
starts releasing
a lot of water you can use your wooden
spoon
to really scrape off the bottom and get
the flavor out as you can see
now that you start releasing water you
can use that water to
deglaze the bottom of the pan
which will add to the flavor overall
hopefully or at least keep things from
burning
all right once the mushroom has looked
around like this so pretty brown
almost very on dark
um
they're ready just take them out of the
pan and put them in a bowl
all right
and now the mushrooms have been taken
out
of all
bean sprouts they have a lot of um
volume free little calories
and they're easy to make
um so i'm going to put four of these in
again same things with chicken where
even if you have some fun on the bottom
mushrooms and from the chicken
these bean sprouts are going to release
a ton of water so you can just use that
water to deglaze the pan and make sure
nothing burns
all right as you can see these are a lot
of volume
with bean sprouts you can eat them
anywhere from nearly raw and very
crunchy
to pretty soft personally i prefer
someone middle because it saves time
on not having to cook them until really
soft
but also i prefer a somewhat soft
texture
for them to sort of blend in with the
rice
so yeah
while these cook and the chicken's
cooled off already i'm going to use this
time to
cut it up
and then every now and again make sure i
stir this around just to make sure
nothing burns and to make sure the pan
is deglazed at the bottom as it releases
water
all right now that these are cooked
through a little bit i'm gonna add the
chicken
which is here
and here
and the mushrooms
but for now i'm just gonna leave it on
top and let it cool down turn the heat
off
and wait for it all to cool off and then
i can put it in the fridge so for this
meal i'm making boneless um typically i
have it either by itself if it's a whole
carry day or a non-training day
or i have with some brown rice typically
around 100 grams
it takes around
i'm going to say an hour and a half of
semi
attention at cooking so like
you have to check back on it every few
minutes
but you can do other things at the same
time
and afterwards you can either simmer it
or sort of slow cook it
personally now i use a
slow cooker to simmer
just because it's more efficient i don't
have to worry about it burning and
sticking to the bottom of the pan um but
in the past i used the dutch oven itself
for around three hours on low heat
but then i'd have to check back every 15
minutes or so to make sure it wasn't
burning
so nowadays i just use a slow cooker to
make it a bit easier
time-wise and effort-wise
because i have a lot of stuff to do from
a page to coaching and training so
every little minute counts all right so
first thing is to add some olive oil now
because i only prepare this meal once a
week i can afford to do some and they
won't really
add that much to my fat
about this much it expands a little bit
as it heats up
there we go
then i'm going to take four of these
which is carrots celery and onion
each one is one kilogram around two
pounds
for these
um
i usually don't have this many but
because i'm deep in prep and
hunger management's concern
making sure i get plenty of vegetables
in my meals is important plus during
prep your calories get lower so you want
to make sure you get enough
micronutrients in and having higher
amounts of vegetables can ensure that
you get those micronutrients in
all right so because this pan isn't
actually big enough to accommodate all
four of these bags at once
you put in two first but it shrink down
that great water and then add the
remaining two so
there we go now at least we're in
um i'm gonna have to wait a while until
they shrink down and lose some water the
good news is because they're frozen i
don't have to keep that close of an eye
on them
until they soften and start losing a lot
of water
so yeah i'll see you then you can
accelerate your process slightly by
going ahead and
stirring it up to make sure there's no
blocked solid ice beginning
but it's not going to do a whole lot
and then every maybe
a few minutes i'll just
scrape off the bottom of the pan or the
dutch oven in this case
to make sure nothing's sticking
i think
with the dutch oven specifically it's
pretty useful because
it has
a lot of volume so you can meal prep in
it but also because of the high sides
the splatter isn't as bad as you get
from
a smaller side of pan
so
i'd recommend getting a dutch oven for
you know prep papa says it's pretty
versatile you put in the oven too
usually um so yeah get on it
and the heat goes on maximum because of
how much food there is in the dutch oven
slash pan
it'll take forever to heat up and now
because there's space in the dutch oven
i can put in the third bag and a fourth
one too
all right and now that all four are in
you just want to keep stirring it until
it softens a lot and starts getting
brown
and then once most of the water is gone
is when you want to take it out and get
your beef mince in or
uh
i don't know what you call in the us but
in the uk it's called beef mince so
you'll see what it is
as you can see now it's shrunk down in
size quite a lot which is normal since
vegetables are
mostly water um
when you start seeing water sort of
thing here and throw down a lot is when
there starts being a risk of burning so
spend on it a bit more
oh yeah i almost forgot to say
full credit a lot of full credit uh but
a lot of credit goes to adam abusio for
this recipe it's not the exact recipe he
uses because i made it a bit more
cutting friendly and also
just did that a little bit but the idea
for using a dutch oven and the general
gist of the recipe
comes from adam brucia so i'll link this
channel bio
um or description i should say
it's a very good channel so check it out
all right so it's pretty much ready now
i'm going to transfer this over to
this which is a slow cooker airfryer
everything
uh just to make it easier and then to
make space for the beef mints all right
that's been transferred over to the slow
cooker
and now i'm not going to bother cleaning
this up i'm just going to add some olive
oil and add the beef mince
about the same amount of olive oil as
before and now we add beef mince i use 5
fat beef mince except for getting my
fats from
other
perhaps healthier sources but you could
use more and then
get your fats from treatments
all right beef minces in and with this
you want to make sure it doesn't stick
especially with lower fat pigments
i do think you can stick a little bit if
you're not careful
so make sure you get around and also
make sure you mash it up you don't want
clumps of beef mince
final product and now it's easiest time
to
separate it and mash it up so just work
now while the beef mist is cooking i'll
take four of these which is around
two kilograms around four pounds total
of tomato pasata which is just very
finely sieved
tomatoes
and add them in all right and now that
i've put in all the tomatoes i can add
some spices typically i add garlic thyme
oregano ground black pepper
and some balsamic vinegar
i'll also add in some parsley and
cayenne pepper sometimes but currently i
don't have any so i'll stick to these
as far as salt goes i personally prefer
salting at the table but if you want
salt now you can
just be aware that it's a lot of food so
you probably need a lot of salt
all right as you can see i added the
spices and the balsamic vinegar i added
a tablespoon tablespoon
yeah a tablespoon of oregano thyme
ground black pepper and garlic
and i added half a cup of balsamic
vinegar that might sound like a lot but
this is a lot of food so
all right when most of the beef looks
like it's not raw anymore i'll squeeze
in a whole
tub of
italian tomato puree or tomato paste
and let it brown a little bit at the end
along with the beef
all right now that most of the water's
gone keep an eye on it because it might
start burning so you want to keep moving
it and at some point it's gonna start
browning when it does keep an eye on it
again
um
if it starts getting
stuck to the bottom of the pan add some
water and scrape it off
and yeah that's about it
also you can kind of smell when it
starts to brown it'll smell different
from before so
keep your nose out i guess
all right i finished cooking the beef i
transferred it all into this pot
and now
i'm going to
get the lid on and turn it on
low heat
and slow cook it for eight hours not low
heat sorry high heat
for eight hours
and that should be enough to
simmer it to an extent
all right so brown rice around 100 grams
and
a seventh of the borneos recipe um which
is around 800 grams 900 grams
um
now the ratio of rice to born here is a
bit messed up but ultimately
there's a lot of bond here so i can stay
full and manage my hunger
