hey folks dr mike israel here fitness
myth series number i don't know
countless number 17.
more cardio
equals more weight lost what that's a
myth
hold on a sec let's take a look at the
claims reasons why it's wrong grains of
truth i'm sure there's some sounds true
to me and then best practices to take
home with you and even take to the gym
if you like if you do that sort of thing
so the claim here is pretty
straightforward
the more cardio you do and we mean
formal cardio here so like 30 minutes
extra on the uh elliptical or step mill
or something
given a certain diet the more cardio you
do the more weight and fat you will lose
seems reasonable
and if you're not losing at the pace you
want
um
doing more cardio like another 30
minutes per day on the stepmill or
whatever might not be the answer you
want here as to what's going to get you
leaner but it is the truth
so those are the claims okay
seems reasonable
but apparently it's wrong and here's why
good news we have
four reasons why it's wrong
first is something i alluded to in an
earlier video
called poncer's paradox
it is the observation very well
supported
that
most humans
as they reach very high levels of
consistent physical activity start to
curtail their activity and it's not even
if you say i have to do this and you do
this you do the cardio let's say you
used to do 30 minutes on the elliptical
you didn't lose fat as fast as you
wanted now you're doing an hour a day
let's say five days a week yeah okay an
hour's an hour you check that box they
did the cardio the thing is though the
total daily energy expenditure is cardio
plus all the other shit you do
throughout the day and the fuel your
body needs what ends up happening is if
you push that formal cardio high enough
your body and brain automatically start
to take away activity from all the other
shit you do
usually you park at the store
you park it down at the end of the lot
you like to walk across the parking lot
just people watch or something
now totally subconsciously you're
parking real close to the store because
you're so fucking tired the more formal
cardio you do the more you get tired the
more informal cardio just general
physical activity that you do your body
temperature can even scoot down a little
the total daily energy output
thus from adding cardio might go like
that
and then thus on the scale week to week
to week losing fat you're like fuck i
added so much cardio how come my weight
is barely budging compared to what it
was because in other ways in other areas
your body is really good at reducing
expenditure if it detects that you're
trying to push expenditure to a really
really high level
right
this creates a natural cap it's soft cap
not a hard cap on daily expenditure it's
kind of like an asymptote if you go 3000
calories a day of expenditure and you
add cardio does your body does just fine
it actually burns most of that let's say
you have 300 calories of cardio
on the day it adds 290.
you get another 300. of that it adds
260. you add another 300 calories that's
a lot of calories of cardio per day
then it only adds 200 and so forth until
it gets to when you're adding cardio it
just subtracts from your total daily
energy expenditure and nothing is gained
that is a thing
and point number two is that if you
fight this and you really just try to
grind it through you get a watch like
this where's this my fit or something
not an endorsement um it's a fine step
tracker you get a snap tracker you do
all kinds of things you make sure camera
really burn this many calories period i
don't care if it's just for formal
cardio i've got the rest of the day
covered it can be done however you will
get unbelievable fatigue from this that
lasts and lasts it'll fuck up your
training it'll fuck up your life it'll
fuck up your sleep
and almost no one can go on like this
for days and days and days as a matter
of fact a lot of times
when people are trying to you know eat a
certain amount and have a crazy high
physical activity it's designed to break
them down a lot of special forces
training especially in the selection
process they intentionally throw more
activity at you that you could possibly
do keep your calorie intake relatively
normal or even below and then like it
causes fatigue and almost everyone to go
like this and when the fatigue
skyrockets that's when they test who's a
bad motherfucker and who's not so
in a situation in which you're like well
i'm trying to get lean i don't have to
test how bad ass i am you don't want to
accidentally put yourself in like a navy
seal training program that level of
difficulty just be like oops guess i did
too much cardio you don't want that
that's not good for your long-term
sustainable fat loss you want to make
things technically as easy as possible
and no easier than that
number three this has been demonstrated
in very high level athletes over and
over it's not just a lot of sponsors
work directly with indigenous tribes and
things like that this has been
demonstrated and observed very well in
elite level athletes who yes they work
hard they have crazy daily energy
outputs however they also have easier
days they don't always go super hard and
if you've seen high performance athletes
let's say on a college campus do you
want athletes in the united states
you'll see something very interesting
especially when they're in season when a
lot of the training volume is insane
the way they walk to class
is like at half a mile an hour pace like
fucking zombies
you'll see them in the dining hall and
everyone else is like wow and athletes
are sitting there like
they are spending almost no energy doing
anything else
because they're compensating
so that their total daily energy intake
because practice eats up so much of it
they compensate the rest of the way so
this whole poncer's paradox works in
athletes it's not like they violated
and
most athletes don't try to have this
psycho energy expenditure of tons and
tons of cardio for example while trying
to reduce their body weight over weeks
and months they wouldn't make it what
they do is athletes at least eat a
shitload of food during that time
or if they're trying to bring their
weight down they only do this for a few
weeks then the weight gets to where they
need to be and then they coast
so if you're trying to do this in a
long-term fat loss plan and you're like
fucking up the cardio careful because
you could be in a situation where no but
there's nobody else left doing the thing
you're doing and that's not because
you're the toughest person maybe you are
but it's just because it's wildly
ineffective
right
so
all these things taken together if you
try upping your cardio beyond what is
already a large increase beyond what is
already challenging you'll get crazy
tired
you'll move less
even though if you do the cardio you
move less than the 50 other things you
do throughout the day
and then your total expenditure
your cardio went up but your movement
throughout the day went down and your
total expenditure is just about the same
so now you're doing more formal cardio
you have less time for other things in
your life and you're miserable and
sustainability is tougher you win
not a whole lot
now that's all the bad stuff there are
some greens of truth
yes increasing cardio can lead to weight
loss duh
especially if you start from low
activity or moderate activity and this
is where a lot of bodybuilders sorry
folks offensive times are ahead a lot of
bodybuilders act like tough
motherfuckers and like fucking eat the
food and do the training you got a
fucking crying through this cardio
brother oh yeah how much car you do
fucking 45 minutes a damn the stepmill
man holy fuck get rid of the olympics
joe bodybuilders here outworking
everyone get the fuck out of here
there's marathon runners that run 10 15
miles a day on average shut the fuck up
45 minutes of cardio what's the rest of
your life like i fucking wake up
i microwave my food
i check client emails
i drive my car directly in front of the
gym i walk out 15 feet i go on a machine
then i do 45 minutes of cardio i go home
i work on client emails i watch tv and i
walk my bulldog for one
foot because that's a fireball dog walks
then i go to sleep
holy fuck man you must be burning like a
trillion calories a day oh wait you're
not and if you weren't doing cardio your
daily energy expenditure would be so low
as to consider you potentially highly
unhealthy okay you're a sedentary person
who slaps on 45 minutes or an hour an
hour half of cardio you're now in the
moderate activity range
so
the the reality is that if you are
already in a high activity range more
cardio is a bad idea but if you're in a
low activity range more cardio is a
great idea and works every time right
the mistake here
is thinking
cardio
always has to lead to more weight loss
and fat loss not that it can under the
right circumstances
that's the thing
after you're already doing a high level
of effort tons of physical activity
adding more cardio on top of that in
more technical terms reduces the
stimulus to fatigue ratio of cardio the
stimulus from going from very high level
of cardio to ultra high the stimulus is
potentially zero extra calories burned
or very few because your body makes up
for in other ways the fatigue is like
fucking insane because you're doing like
eight miles of walking a day or some
crazy ass shit on top of your normal
shit
so it's not worth it at some point it's
not worth
so cardio can lead to weight loss
increasing it can but not if it's
already very high
usually if it's low or moderate a good
decent increase works really well
and here's the thing cardio still works
we're not shining again cardio it's
super healthy
if it's sustainable and you're not
overdoing it it causes great levels of
fat loss
and it is done
cumulatively over the course of months
and months on average in the moderate to
hard range oh 10 to 15 000 steps a day
for most people will set up an awesome
baseline a fat burning energy
expenditure and all you do is you
control your diet a little bit decrease
the carbs decrease the fats a little
eliminate all the junk and then voila
you're losing pounds and pounds of fat a
week
mission accomplished what you don't want
to do is keep that food ultra high
and just raise the card even higher
because that's somewhere your body can't
really go
i guess the decent analogy here is kind
of like
if you're
towing
like a trailer that's two tons with your
truck up you know let's say you're going
somewhere in colorado so there's
mountains
it's the analogy here is like
if
you say have a trailer there's two tons
and someone's like hey like
what about if we bring extra shit it's
gonna weigh three tons is that cool
it might be but maybe three tons is like
the max towing capacity of your rig and
at a certain grade
you know you're at like 18 000 rpms and
going 40 miles an hour
the heat in the engine seems to be
getting quite high like ah fuck it just
do more cardio just go faster like there
are limits to that shit and at some
point it's not a good idea you can't
simply throw more shit in the back and
be like fuck the truck will handle it
there is a weight limit just the same
with your body there is a limit of
expenditure after which it doesn't
fucking matter what else you're doing
your body's like not fuck that
so
where does that leave us as far as best
practices something similar to what i
said uh in the lecture before this is
diet always comes first
okay so yes doing more cardio is part of
the solution potentially to increasing
your rate of fat loss however you should
fuck with diet first
now
there's luckily a very simple
algorithmic formula for how to determine
what to do next so here's the situation
you're stalling out or let's say you're
supposed to be losing half a pound of
fat every week and last week you lost
0.4 pounds and the week before that you
lost 0.35 and you're like ah shit
i got to do something i have to lose
weight faster totally fine totally
understandable
you just ask
the following several questions and they
will give you the right answer of what
to do
you ask
will
cutting my food calories
make me more miserable or rather keep it
even simpler
how miserable would i be if i cut the
calories i need for my daily diet this
much misery roughly in your mind just
emotional misery
what about if i increase my cardio
enough to burn those extra calories how
much misery will that cause me because
like if you're already doing a lot of
cardio someone's like all right you want
to eat this apple and then chop on the
treadmill for 20 minutes like fuck that
fuck get that apple out of my face i'm
not seeing that treadmill until tomorrow
i've had enough right so you figure out
which one of these
is it cutting the food how much misery
will that give you or is it increasing
the calories
uh from expenditure how much misery will
that give you and you pick the one that
gives you the least misery i said okay
i'm eating plenty still and i'm getting
pretty high on the cardio here
i'm gonna cut my diet a little bit cut
food intake keep the cardio or you can
say well fuck i'm barely doing anything
cardio is totally fine
uh and i'm not eating much i'm eating
like a fucking bird at this point let me
increase my activity and it'll be
totally fine right
peak the least painful option the one
that causes you the least overall stress
and difficulty and it can be a
combination of both so well you know too
much cardio too little or too much food
too little i'm not interested i'm gonna
cut my food a little bit and raise my
cardio and that might be the right
answer very very simple for me
now
if your cardio is ever so high
that you feel notably tired throughout
the day and
half of the rest of or half of the next
day
from that cardio
and you're not progressing in your fat
loss at the pace you need do not add
cardio because that will make you so
tired of the fear of everything else
your best bet there is to either reduce
the nutrient intake and if you're like
dude if i reduce nutrients i'm just
going to collapse i'm going to be so
hungry and tired and useless then the
answer is one of two things
one if it's normal dieting
take a maintenance phase
reduce all the diet fatigue get cracking
at it two months later no problem
option two
you're a few weeks out from a highly
competitive physique show
grind it through
see you guys next time
you
