oh it's good to be back weekly webinar
dr
james dr mike we got about an hour to
answer
your questions mike how's it going dude
it's going really well
um let's get started
and yeah actually our first question
isn't really a question but i put it in
any way because it was so pertinent to
the last
um webinar it's uh ant
uh ant dagar
all the way at the very top right under
milo
he says
greg ducett's 199 training book is
called harder than last time the
complete hypertrophy strength training
manual and no
it's not worth it oh no
you know yeah i don't know maybe to some
people it is and then
somebody said greg is a meme in himself
at this point
um and
uh he's not getting a whole lot of love
in that
comment thread but um it's funny because
the book says like
i looked up i clicked on the link and it
says like if you
why is this book 200 is one of the
questions like the sample questions
and he says like if you have to ask then
clearly you don't know how valuable this
book is
you know what on the one hand that's a
really shitty answer but on the other
hand like
you know there's something to that where
like if you're really keen on his stuff
maybe it is worth it to you if really
does have all the answers like of course
you're skeptical right but
you know i'm not going to where he
makes his money i i just sort of i guess
i think
maybe my opinion is like leave it up to
the educated youtube viewer to really
decide if
if there's a potential realistic
potential of
200 worth of value in a book like that
and if you think there is
maybe that they should be spending that
money i'm curious meatbag
said it's all 50 pages does that mean
it's like only 50
some odd pages he did
yeah look on that same thread look at
what meatbag says
wow it says but it's a whole 50 plus so
50 plus could be 200 but
usually when people write it that way it
means it's like 57 or something
along those lines oh it's only four
dollars a page
ouch hey you know what more power to you
greg if if you're making a buck on that
right on
by everywhere all right let's move on to
our actual question
uh coming up is uh
ken jay hold on i lost
somebody that fast ken m2
can m2 oh sorry ken m
i was going to say there's a can m is
there really a can m2 that i have to
look for oh my god
so ken am now ken's question doesn't
have a lot of upvotes
but it does it is um uh a really really
easy to answer super fast question that
is just a very distinct answer
and he says hey docs i was wondering why
close grip bench press
isn't with the triceps drop down or in
one of the tricep exercise options for
the meal physique template 2.0
but it wasn't in 1.0 either as uh
you can actually google meadow
henselman's close grip bench press chest
triceps
meadow has a great write-up about how in
emg studies and recruitment studies the
close-grip bench press
is probably like mostly a chest exercise
it just has more triceps than the wide
grip bench but it's still predominantly
a chest
exercise and james i don't know what
your experience is but for me if i close
for a bench
it's a huge hit to my chest and it's
decent hits the triceps but it can't
really be called a tricep spiritual
exercise i think at best
it's 50 50 for most people some people
get a lot of triceps or very little
chest out of it but that's unlikely
james yeah i totally agree it's always
been a chest movement for myself that's
how i always counted
and i see a lot of people get really
crazy with the grips and i think that's
where they kind of fall off the wagon on
the
close grip where if people go like you
know thumb to thumb basically on your
trying to make it as tricepy as possible
then it's just awkward and weird and
really you're probably going to get way
more out of it just taking like a thumb
length or half a thumb length
from your normal medium grip and just
moving in with both hands about that
it should still be a chest exercise so
if you're trying to individualize your
close grip bench technique so that it's
almost exclusively triceps
you're probably going about it the wrong
way what you want to do is take your
normal bench press feel and just shift
the emphasis a little bit to the triceps
that's what you
that's what you're going for
all right right below him is mitchell
herman
god is our next question asker says hi
doc's have a question regarding
implementing cardio alongside with
hypertrophy
training what is the best way to program
cardio to optimize my general health
while still making the most gains
my main focus is hypertrophy but i want
to start including cardio for general
health reasons
what modes intensities durations
frequencies and timing best to achieve
this
on top of say a six day weekly trainings
but thanks so um
i'm gonna have a a big video coming out
on this eventually like where
we have so many videos in the works um
like at various stages of production
that there's just gonna be like i'm
going to say oh we're going to have a
video and some sometimes it's going to
come out a year later
but it's coming and it's going to be
awesome it's going to answer all these
questions in depth but i'm going to take
a really quick run at this just super
brief
um would you get this question a lot and
then james will play clean up for me as
usual james is that okay with you yeah
for sure
okay so what is the best way to program
uh my cardio to multiply general health
main focuses approach if you want to
student cardio general health reasons
what modes came modes
is going to be the modes that are number
one the most fun and one you can
reliably do
and two ones that are least fatiguing
okay so like you don't want to go start
jogging because it's gonna beat
your ass
elliptical is fine swimming is fine
incline walking is fine
high impact modes are probably not the
best of choice
and as far as modes uh one of the best
ones is just getting an activity tracker
wristwatch
and making sure you get x number of
minimum steps per day something like at
least five thousand
and if you get up to eight thousand plus
steps per day that's usually a lot of
activity
and that'll keep you lean and give you
tons of health without having to go and
do formal cardio
and interestingly enough it actually
changes your behavior
to make you a more productive person
like you actually like want to do more
stuff
like go with your wife to walk the dogs
go to the grocery store
go walk around get up from the you know
the seat you have in the kitchen and go
to you know the deck to you know clean
up really quick because that all adds to
your cardio
and the tracker and it actually a
wonderful thing so give that a shot
sidebar real quick really good strategy
while you guys are cutting this is
something i tell my clients all the time
pick up new projects clean the house
clean your workstation just find reasons
to get up and move around it's an
awesome way of just burning a few extra
calories
yeah and it's great for your health uh
intensities
usually lower intensities better now if
you want a good good health result
you think okay i got to be breathing
heavy at some point here's the cool
thing proper hypertrophy training six
days a week like your training
already does that it's giving you a
great cardio workout for health-wise
what you need to do is just increase
your activity so the lower intensity
low to moderate is usually best we don't
want you guessing out we don't want you
doing
uh high intensity interval training
stuff like that durations honestly with
a step tracker that handles itself
but generally speaking if you train six
days a week i would say three days a
week
for 20 to 30 minutes at a time of extra
cardio planned cardio if you're gonna do
it
isn't more than enough anything above
that is some combination bonus points
for your health slash starts to really
impinge on hypertrophy more and more
frequencies again two to three times a
week is totally fine maybe two to four
times a week if you're
uh extra inclined timing is to be honest
as far away from your workout as
possible
uh and that's probably the best thing so
a really good thing is if you want to
like get a stop tracker
and when you if you if you have this on
your schedule when you wake up in the
morning
go take a brisk walk that's 20 to 30
minutes it's going to
add a shitload to your steps it's going
to get you moving throughout the day
after that come home shower have
breakfast have a cup of coffee you'll
feel amazing
and that's way the hell away from your
workout if you work out in the middle of
the day and if you work out in the
morning
you know middle of the day take a walk
or something like that that's probably
best james
yeah that was really good and uh
mitchell one of the last couple webinars
we actually hit this exact question in
pretty pretty good detail so you can
check the time stamps on the last maybe
one
two or three webinars we did a pretty
good job of hitting that mike nailed it
uh the thing is like uh for health you
don't actually have to do
cardio for cardio sake you can really
find other workarounds to really promote
your health
the thing with adding like specific
cardio modalities it usually makes you
excellent at those cardio modalities the
question is are you doing it for health
are you doing it to get good at cardio
right
and so that's kind of where you draw the
line and say okay why am i just doing it
for health and i'm really focused on
hypertrophy which is what you're saying
or am i trying to get good at running am
i trying to get good at cycling swimming
etc
and so if you're not trying to do the
latter if you're not trying to get good
at endurance type activities
just staying active just walking
anything along those lines picking up a
new hobby even just like
doing yard work around the house like if
you live somewhere like i live you find
yourself chainsawing and moving logs and
doing all sorts of all day long
more than enough and in terms of dosages
like mike nailed it
generally lower intensity stuff
frequencies of two to three times a week
gets you like
they've actually quantified this and i
don't remember it off the top of my head
but if you take somebody who's doing
no cardio and you have them add like two
times
per week 20 minutes at a time very very
low
intensity you reap like a massive amount
of the potential benefit just from doing
that and i don't want to i don't want to
give the wrong numbers here
uh so i'm not going to throw any out
there but long story short is a little
bit goes a long way
you get most of that from very very low
doses so you don't have to add a lot of
structured training
yep
yep yep all right right below him next
question
ask her are perennial oh boy tender
mantas
he says does the stimulus to fatigue
ratio provided by plyometrics at
different reps in reserve
mash the sfr at the exact re-r5 perch oh
man i can see that going wrong real
quick oh boy
for example might have a three
to zero rr progression or would the
progression of rar be similar
oh my imagine before you had a
motorcycle so so james just to make sure
we're on the same age
i don't think he's asking if the sfr is
the same
i think he means the relative sfr
dynamics so
no i i get it i was the more imagining
like what is an rir
zero depth jump that's where you just
splat and you don't come back
this is all you go ahead and please
explain uh yeah so what mike was getting
at there is exactly
the right idea so you can approach
plyometrics with
what i would do is substitute rir with
just more of a relative intensity
scaling like a
effort scale kind of thing and that will
work just fine
it will follow the same patterns in
terms of increasing in intensity
you know week to week generally speaking
aside from individual considerations but
yeah generally you're going to have some
plow metrics that are programmed at
starting intensities that aren't
brutally hard right that might
mean not jumping as high or as fast or
as forceful still within like what is
considered you know stimulative
but maybe not a maximal effort and
essentially you're going to start taking
those same movements and trying to do
them a little bit harder until
you're eventually approaching what would
be kind of maximal effort plyometric
type activity so
you could parallel that with an rir like
we do with bodybuilding training and say
okay rir 0 basically means all out in
this case you don't want to go to
failure literally in that sense because
that's just a disaster
but you would be putting forth the best
effort relative effort
that you could in each one of those reps
per set
excellent i'm so glad i have james for
sports stuff because i have no
sorry i wasn't laughing at your question
i was just was imagining
i was taking it very literally and of
course just daydreaming off into
stupidity land um it's a
applios to failure so if that if
if there was any hint of that within the
question which i don't think there was
you probably already got figured out the
answer right
definitely don't do plows to fail your
literal failure
yeah so i just want to say something
before we answer the next question
sorry i'm sorry i had a actual a real
thought not just thoughts
so um failure in the case of this type
of training and this is something that
you can actually see in laboratory tests
and something that mike and i did when
we were phd students
failure in like a plyometric or anything
that's like speed power
oriented is uh essentially where you
fail to hit
the power and speed threshold of the
movement right
and this is clear this is something that
they've actually demonstrated many many
times with the weightlifting derivatives
and what you generally find is if you
ask somebody to do like a a clean pull
or a mid thigh pull
they're able to generate a lot of power
on the first
one to five reps but everything after
that dramatically
falls off and that's one of the
recommendations why we don't one of the
reasons why we don't recommend doing
more than five reps for a lot of those
different movements because
in the literature it's very clear more
often than not cluster sets
aside if you're doing regular sets after
about five reps fatigue just kicks in
and you can no longer
produce the power and speed necessary to
hit that overload threshold for the
movement so in this case
you might see a technical failure and
you might see like a power output
velocity type failure as well
yep i'm usually 90 to cut off there
for a power velocity output that no
longer really trains power velocity
so um just real quick our next question
is going to be
by bastian engerly
and it's right below there but i just
want to call out uh clausosaurus
from above had tons of upvotes and he
asks us
to critique his recently designed
new push-pull legs program clouso we
would love to
like take a shot at a fraction of that
it's
tough in this format to break down
entire programs
maybe we can break down the pushing for
you one week the pulling another week
and the legs another week
if all those get up voted or maybe some
of them will and you'll get some
feedback
the thing is that's like a six day
program we'd just be ripping you off man
because we're giving you some
answers as like we just flash look at it
it's not good enough
we gotta split it up so so that's why
we're answering
um boston ingraley's program because
it's very simple
it's one goal and it's only three days
so
just hopefully that's why james does
that make sense because i think we've
said before like we prefer not to do
full program critiques in this yeah and
just to add on to what mike's saying
it's a lot easier for us and it's not
that we don't we're just being lazy it's
just one of those where it's just like
it's hard to give a good answer because
we have no clue otherwise what you're
doing so what's helpful for me and i'm
sure for mike as well
is if you have a program in this case
like you have this program
give us the questions that you have
about the program is my exercise
selection good
did i pick the right rep ranges did i
have the right frequency splits should i
in question at a time is preferred
yeah one at a time but like um if you
just say like here's my program
what do you think we're gonna skip it if
you say
i've been having trouble with my chest
hitting my chest mrv like prematurely
can you look and see if there's
any exercises or rep ranges that might
be contributing to that
something a little bit more specific is
always helpful
[Music]
all right sebastian angrily says uh
since i didn't stick to the rules last
time i'm asking too many questions i've
ever posted now
critiquing my leg program to increase
vertical jump the following is the first
block with the gold acres strength it
will last as long as good progress is
made
after that a more hypertrophy focused
block follows for a month or so followed
by another strange block
so this is the first block us presumably
of several
is that how i mean to interpret this
okay and so
day one it's got this uh squat squats
powerful flex press
day three it's got some squats power
clean partial drums oh
yeah face leg press and then day five
it's got
volume squats a lot of partial arm
squatting and
four five good mornings james why don't
you pick up the stuff there that you
think is good and the stuff there do you
think could be
replaced with some other stuff so
apologies in advance boss john my
my tendency is to focus on the things
that are bad
uh so i'm gonna come out with those
rapid fire and then i will try to
throw you some cred here so first thing
off the bat your exercise ordering is a
little bit off
you're going to want any of those power
movements to come before any of the
strength focus movements so in for
example you got power cleans generally
coming after squats
unfortunately just like in the last
question doing the squats is going to
generate enough fatigue
for the most part where you probably
won't be able to hit the max power
thresholds that you need to benefit from
those cleans likewise with the jumps and
anything like that
so we have some ordering to kind of fix
so the gender and i actually have one of
the
one of my videos on the strength
conditioning series talks about this
explicitly so you can go and check that
out but long story short
anything that's meant to be like a
sprint or plyometric or a jump would be
first
next would be kind of like your high
power output things then comes your
strength and then comes kind of like
your volume hypertrophy work capacity
type things
so you're kind of almost there but you
need some reordering
next that's a lot of squats especially
lifting heavy i would
maybe i mean you might be able to
tolerate doing heavy squats that many
times per week
i would say a lot of squats that's a lot
especially for
the rep ranges that you're using number
three
coming out the gate doing sets of one
and three for your strength block holy
 my man
if you were coming off of let's say you
did like a hypertrophy block
and maybe you kind of split the
difference and you did one where maybe
you were doing
you know hypertrophy for a strength
sport so you might have been doing sets
of like four to eight
and then you were kind of transitioning
in this direction that would make more
sense but
god damn coming out the gate on your
first strength block doing singles and
triples
i think that's a mistake what i would do
is have it more similar to your day
five where you're maybe doing sets of
you know four to eight and then each
subsequent strength mezzo you do
you could get closer and closer to those
triples and singles
which would be fine but coming out with
that is going to it's going to oh man
it's going to be rough
let's see not a fan of the partial range
of motion
squat especially you're doing squats
power cleans and then this i'm looking
at day three specifically
squats power cleans and then partial
range of motion squats with calf raise
so it's kind of like a speed squat
partial range of motion sounds like
to me you have to ask the question what
is that
doing for me that the squats and the
power cleans that i've already done in
this session what is that accomplishing
that those things haven't already
accomplished so
day three for example what i would do is
make power cleans first
and then just have a squat variation
that you want to use and maybe in this
case since you have so many squat days
maybe just don't squat on that day or
i don't know you might want to revise
that um
also the leg presses mike i'm rambling
here i'm sorry this is just me
rapid firing some
i was gonna say it's what he's paying
money for he's not paying any money so
that's what these two
tuning in for is exactly this feedback
yeah and then it's kind of the
the uh the leg press is a little curious
for me so when you get to
when you get to a strength and power
focus block
you're probably going to start removing
a lot of the kind of accessory lifts so
in this case if i was working with an
athlete
i would have the leg press and squats
for sure maybe in their hypertrophy
blocks for trying to build up the quads
and that's a good
for most people a good quad sfr
exercises because there's not a ton of
systemic spillover
um but i would start systematically
removing things like leg press
and just getting the predominant uh you
know we'll call it like quad or leg push
volume from the squats and the clean
jumps and stuff like that
and taking some of those things out it's
not just it's not to split hairs and say
reps of six and reps of eight
are bad but you are starting to deviate
away
from strength and power output and it's
one of those things where like three by
eight
might be enough to wipe you out in a
subsequent session like the next day
from executing your power
threshold for whatever movements that
you're doing right so it's again it's
not to split hairs about reps here but
it is enough
to say yeah the next day you might not
be able to do a sprint or a jump if that
was something that you had planned on
doing
mike how am i doing so far i feel like
that was a big ramble i think that's
really good man i think that just about
covers it
because that uh vosgen has plenty of uh
things to take home to the bank and try
to improve
and then boss john one thing before we
leave and i'm sorry i felt like i was
trying
i wasn't trying to rip you a new one i
know you were just asking for some
advice and i think you're
you're definitely on the right track
we're just trying to fine-tune it up a
little bit
um i don't know if you if you wrote this
literally or if it's if it's if this is
already built in but we i would really
recommend using rep
ranges um instead of just straight set
by reps
because um you know for example four by
five
good mornings um i think for most people
the hamstrings are such a strong
faster twitch muscle it's hard to do
actually four sets of anything for the
same number of reps without really low
balling it
same thing with like the squats and the
cleans what i would do
is set a rep range for yourself and
maybe the first you know the first
um for like power cleans for the first
mezzo it might be like one to five until
you could auto regulate each set well if
you feel a little sluggish like after
set excuse me rep three you're like i'm
kind of feeling shitty then just call it
on that
right um same thing with the squats
maybe do like four to eight
something like that um i would get out
of the habit of the straight
set by reps with if you're not auto
regulating those reps a little bit with
with our
or something
all right right below braxton prince is
our next question
sounds like a very rich person oh yeah
that sounds like benedict cumberbatch
braxton prince yeah and his picture
matches
so um hey docs could you give some
practical recommendations for keeping
track of body fat percentages
i know you have commonly recommended
staying within a range of 10-15 for the
most part
i find when massing is easy to get
neurotic and panicked over fat gain
so you have any recommendations for
reasonably estimating body fat
percentage so you could differentiate
between over
reacting to slight fat gain and
recognizing when you've gained enough
body fat that it's time to finish
massive
so um yeah absolutely
you can do a real objective one or you
do skin folds
in maybe like on your quad and the skin
fold
on your uh abs in the same place uh you
can just get skin full calibers yourself
using them every day or every other day
or twice a week for all all time
and you know what skin fold you got the
last time you finished massing and you
were like still reasonably decent
and then you do a cut and you start
massing again and if you
like for two weeks in a row repeat or
exceed those top
mass skin folds last time you have an
objective criteria
upon which you're like okay i'm like
quantitatively as fat as i was so
you know it's over right where i have to
do mini cut or something i got that
method from broderick chavez
uh teen evil gsb on instagram look
really really good stuff now
uh where do you pick that number though
and where you pick it is really just a
matter of appearance
um because you can gain mass and get
quite fat and still have really good
results even worth of 15
so you have to just kind of pick where
you know usually when people's abs
get pretty blurry most people stop
masking and that's a really good thing
for
me that are already pretty lean so you
know you cut until your abs are very
clear
you mass until your abs are very blurry
and you're trying to get blurry out
you're trying to go to a nice slow
stable pace
the longer it takes for abs you get
blurry the better because the more
muscle less fat you gain
but at some point they will get blurry
into if you do a skin fold caliper kind
of thing
it's a really really good thing to
confirm that with both visual
confirmation and some kind of metric
confirmation that would be the best
thing
to do i think if you start getting taxes
and and
uh have somebody else other than
yourself do your skin fold or do
bia all that stuff is just wildly wildly
and precise and can't really guide you a
whole lot unfortunately
yeah i agree and then one of the things
i've just
been seeing more and more and i know
i've fallen into this trap myself and
certainly i've had clients fall into
this trap but just there's definitely a
culture of it especially in men
is you get increasingly fat phobic
on your mass phase and the key the thing
is it's like you're you're amassing to
gain weight
and then i think people start to lose
sight of that once they're not quite as
lean and as jack as they were before and
then it becomes an issue of like
should i get a dexa scan to make sure
i'm not 12 body fat
at some point you do have to make peace
with the fact that you're going to gain
weight and some of that's going to be
fat
and it's going to get worse as you go
right that's just the reality and i
think a lot of people
um i'm trying to like find the right
words here without sounding
condescending but i think a lot of
people try to
use like our sport science and exercise
science tools
as an excuse to kind of feed this like
fat phobia
on the mass phase and it kind of drives
me nuts where it's like at the end of
the cut you have somebody who is
so ready to mask and then after five
weeks they're like i don't know i should
probably get a skin full test it's like
dude you signed up for this this is what
you wanted
you got to make peace with it so as much
as i am on board for
being quantitative being systematic at
some point you also have to say like i
can't fuss
over tracking my body fat that hard
because a
is incredibly uh imprecise and b
ultimately like
the end result is mostly the same do i
want to gain muscle still
yes well i'm gonna get fatter and the
key is keeping tabs on that and making
sure it doesn't kind of exceed
too high of rates but most of that's
done with your body weight measurements
so
i think my suggestion was really good i
have become
of the opinion more and more as i've
gotten older to
dismiss the body fat testing because i
feel like it only causes people pain and
frustration
not to say that it's not valuable at all
it's just for like the average person it
just ends up causing a lot of confusion
and like i said frustration
all right nults
is up next just below that
daniel hacker i see you i'll i'll pick
those up here let's see
but we uh unfortunately not enough
unknowns okay
so notes says is it more beneficial to
train every muscle from nav to mav
until fatigue forces you to deload or
train some muscles from mav
to high end mav slash mrv while other
muscles are training to get med
low end mav example for push chest delts
tricep squats and
calves plus pull back biceps glutes and
hamstrings
meso one push upper focus chest on
triceps push lower focus
mezzo two push lower focus
uh pull upper focus and repeat training
all muscles to fmv is really fatiguing
and i have to deal with because of
fatigue
not that their specific muscle that has
reached mrd is the idea of something i
should
consider doing so yeah i actually should
so the way we describe
people ask us is a very similar question
to when should i do priority
phases or when should i prioritize
muscles and the answer is this you have
a list of all the muscles you want to
grow and maybe it's all the muscles main
muscle groups in your body and we have a
question
can you train all of the individual
muscles up to their individual mrvs
where their performances
uh stall and then slightly uh go down
or at least stall so you're not gaining
strength anymore during
the actual mesocycle performance isn't
going up if
it because the muscle itself is fatigued
and limiting not because the systemic
factors were there so if you can
individually reach muscle mrvs you don't
need to do the priority phases for
example people that are smaller
more slower to which and beginners can
train every muscle immediately no
problem and just like walk out of there
and they could do
that every day sometimes and be totally
fine as you get more advanced the
muscles grow
and they demand more and more high-end
training in order to get good results
that results in a situation where they
accumulate much more fatigue and the
systemic
cost becomes very very high add up all
the systemic costs and you get this
little
interesting situation which is almost
universal in advanced lifters
the sum of all individual muscle mrvs is
higher than your systemic mrv
you are detecting it exactly like we
have described
training all muscles to med says is
really fatiguing enough deal because of
fatigue not that specific muscle has
reached mrv
right so basically you're just
you come into the gym and you're
tired
right if you come into the gym and you
feel great systemically and you push a
muscle and it's like nope i can't do
this many reps i can't get any stronger
that's you know do that twice in a row
it's probably muscular marketing if you
come into the gym
and your like muscles have been getting
nice and strong and you're not doing
objectively a lot of volume but you're
so
 beat up from all the other
training you've been doing then that's a
systemic limit right
so the question is when do you need to
start prioritizing
is exactly when your sum of mrvs for
individual muscles
exceeds your systemic mrv and it's it's
a little ambiguous at first but after a
few months you're going to be like okay
clearly i just can't
do us all it's like eating all four of
your favorite foods and large portions
on the same plate
at some point if the portions get big
you know just can't do it anymore you're
going to
have to split this into the different
meals or something like that right
so so that's just the case and it's
going to be pretty obvious when it
happens that when it's obvious
take several muscles just one or two at
first and put them on we recommend just
putting them on maintenance phone or
just minimum effective volume really
maintenance volumes the muscle
maintain them for a couple of mesos
while training all the other
muscles from mev all the way up to mrv
okay uh and then if a couple months
couple years later
you might have to take another muscle
and put it on the back burner during a
time very very advanced lifters that are
incredibly big and strong
to give their best best growth to their
prioritized muscles can sometimes be in
half the body
like a really high level bodybuilder may
only be able to grow half his body with
due diligence while the other half is at
maintenance that's totally possible
especially with muscles that are large
especially ones he's struggling to build
so for example branch warren is a
perfect example of he had very very
miraculous genetically gifted legs he
also worked his ass off for them
but his legs were just awesome his upper
body was clearly behind he got the same
he was competing bodybuilding on a high
level you got the same feedback at every
show with branch your legs look
unbelievable your upper body is lacking
he took one year of not training legs at
all that's a bit extreme right
but his maintenance volume for legs
turned out to be really close to zero
because after two months of training his
legs were as big as they ever were like
he barely lost any size which is freaky
genetics right but
basically that illustrates the point of
like he just couldn't
if he was training legs he couldn't do
diligence just her proper body he
succeeded
he brought his upper body up a ton and
he took a second at the olympia big big
deal right so
that's an example of how that would work
and it starts to become obvious when
your systemic fatigue
exceeds your now real quick last thing i
want to answer here
is you ask here is it is it more
beneficial to train every muscle from
nav to mav until fatigue forces you to
deal
okay so fatigue forcing you to deal is
mrv
it's not mev okay if you are still
somewhere around your mav or to put it
another way because maven mrv can be the
same value at the end of the month cycle
if you're not at mrv yet fatigue doesn't
force you to deload
and this is one of the reasons why james
and i are theoretically
at least asking people to consider mrv
is a very good metric for when to deload
because
deloading any sooner may in some cases
be more optimal absolutely
but it's so difficult to figure out if
you're just stopping for no good goddamn
reason
deloading before you have reached
remotely close to your mrv
is similar to getting gas when you have
just driven
for two hours but in your gas cans your
indicator is broken
but you know it's for it's good for at
least four hours if you you've driven
for two now you don't know exactly
where the engine fuel is but you're like
gee you know
it's probably not it and maybe you did a
lot of hill driving maybe you revved it
too much maybe your efficiency is off
maybe you are
gonna be you know the fuel light still
comes on while it's saying that you can
get it but
basically mrv is when your fuel light
comes on that's probably
you know you can if you have a good
gauge you can get fuel sooner
but you know we don't have a good gauge
that's the problem so for example
in real world someone could be gaining
five pounds
or a rep on their lift every week and
still going up and there's no end in
sight right like
their rir's they're falling but they're
like adding like
strength every every week it's going up
are you as a coach going to tell them to
stop when they're getting
amazing gains
if that's you are you going to cut
yourself back like fundamentally
stopping at mev
is like someone's like hey man will you
do next week deload they're like oh yeah
get pretty beat up and you're like don't
feel great getting the best
strengthenings of my life here
like okay so why are you stopping and
it's like well i feel like mrv's coming
soon
look if you have a good idea that it is
it better be detecting fatigue but if
it's not
james and i what we'd like to do is for
every mesocycle that goes
you know to go to maximum productivity
we like to see
some performance iffyness at the end
that at least tells us really close
james yeah that was a really good answer
and this is kind of the like classic
training age conundrum that you run into
throughout your careers where we start
to see at the intermediate level
you just can't train everything anymore
and you have to start like mike said
thinking about prioritization phases now
you might not be taking a
a literal prioritization phase like
we're saying okay well i'm an
intermediate now so i have to only train
arms or i have to only train
quads right a good place to start
is take a couple muscle groups
especially if they're if it's a large
one like quads or chest
and just bring them down to mev and see
if that allows you to keep training
productively everywhere else
you might not have to take everything
down to to baseline levels
but what we generally find is that the
more advanced you become so as you
become an early intermediate you might
go down to meds for some things
as you become a late intermediate you
have to start entertaining mv's more and
more and when you become advanced
you really have to start picking and
choosing which muscle groups that you're
actually trying to make gains on and the
rest of them will generally go to mv's
simply because your mevs and your mav
values are so high you just have to free
up a lot of resources so
i would say if this is your first time
playing around with this
take a couple muscle groups that are
less important to you and just take them
down to any v levels see how that meso
goes
and then kind of rinse and repeat and do
some experiments you might find
many v wasn't enough to get you the the
outcome that you wanted
and maybe take them down to envy the
next time and see if that goes any
better
all right phillip
gramet gramacikowski
very hero got him
got him all right great question here
when training stubborn muscle groups
that seemingly seem to handle volume
like it is nothing
recover well and barely get sore or take
a performance hit
what do you do if you may gain slowly
but never seem to reach mrv and of
course you train with good form
there is a moment when you no longer
want to train a muscle group for an
hour yep how do you go about such a
situation
do you try new exercises to see if
something stresses the muscle a bit
harder percent or do you go forward to
see if you can reach a limit
do you train that way for however long
it works i recently pushed my volume for
chest
up to about 25 to 30 percent
and was able to stay that high for two
or three months without it causing
trouble
mostly doing bench press variations at
seven to ten reps percent
packs seem to handle it fine this has
been the case from the start but my
training history and my bench press
usually suffers from peaking slash
deload
when i train for power lifting needs
this is a very important point we're
gonna be able to answer your question
really well that we know that
and the only periods where i've gotten
consistent gains is when i do very high
volume program for bench press another
excellent point for us to really be able
to answer your question
so first phillip i'm gonna answer it
theoretically and then i'm gonna answer
practically for you and
james will tell me what i got wrong so
here's the deal
if a ma of a muscle seems to be able to
handle volume like nothing
and if it takes no performance hit
seemingly that means your performance is
still improving
it's okay to progress and increase
volume or stay very high volumes for a
long time
as long as you're getting progress
that's not really a wrong answer
and if you increase the volume a little
bit over time you can see if maybe you
get
faster progress or better progress or
more visible muscle gains
with a higher level of volume right
there is good research now that shows
the average hard gainer okay benefits
more likely for more volume than less
volume because it used to be people said
like well
sometimes it's less sometimes it's warm
they're completely correct but it's more
likely more than less
okay why because hard gainers usually
just have
slower twitch muscles that are less
mechanically positioned
to take damage and tension and thus they
just don't grow as much but also those
same reasons that they don't grow as
much are also the ones that give them an
infinite work capacity
like if you take an elite level marathon
runner and try to grow their lighting
with squats
after like the first six months they're
gonna grow barely anything because
they're going to be like oh i'm doing 90
squats that's a day and
i don't feel it they're like oh god damn
it you're so goddamn slow twitch that of
course you wouldn't feel
right like you know that that's just the
situation right
so so yes continue to go so how do you
go about situation
progressively increase volume or stay at
a high volume uh you can
try a lower volume uh you should do some
due diligence with that so try a little
bit of a lower volume don't increase the
volume just put more load on the bar
over a few mesocycles and see if you get
really good results because sometimes
you absolutely can't get a situation
where your recovery is really good
but your adaptation isn't as good as it
is at a lower level of stimulus that's
absolutely possible
it's not as likely as just doing more
but it is possible you should do due
diligence
because you could find out like oh my
god i've been doing 30 sets work i've
got my best growth of 15
and i started at 20 i should have just
gotten down to 15. so definitely go low
first
see if you do a mesocycle you have lower
than usual volume see how it goes
chances are it'll go like now you
don't have to do this other people have
to do this if they're in that situation
why don't you have to do because you
told us two things first of all
you said that your pressing strength uh
usually suffers from peaking and
deloading
classic classic high turnover
slower twitch muscle that just fades
away if you don't train it a lot
absolutely classic peaking and tapering
works great for super giant super fast
twitch people it works the opposite
for people that a classic peaking
tapering just any one protocol is going
to work better for faster twitch people
uh in most cases and then he says the
only periods where i've gotten
consistent gains is when i do a very
high volume program for bench press
i mean philip without being too big of a
dick this is usually james's job
he just kind of answered your own
question bro like yeah and you may still
get even
better results with an even higher
volume i would say you should explore
volumes
slowly incrementally carefully to test
your mrv because then you'll have
volumes all the way up from med to mrv
and you'll have data in your program
about which ones give you the best
results
and then you can say yeah you know
there's this middle ground that's good
and then you stay around the middle
ground
and play with the other variables or the
entire thing is good and that's really
cool
um or the lower part is good or the
higher part is good for you
probably the higher part is good so to
answer your question of like you no
longer want to train a muscle
for hours you know all the time four or
five times a week that's
how your pecs are
you just that's what you're gonna have
to do yeah very thorough very good
answer from dr mike here i had only had
a couple editions
so you so michael and he said this just
might be you right and so you might be
that guy who has to do 30 sets
plus potentially per week of chess that
might be you right
i would also add that despite using good
technique
it's kind of an sfr issue where whatever
you're doing is just not the best choice
so you might find that whatever
exercises you're doing you're executing
them really well at least you know
externally
but they might not be just disrupting
you that much now i know you said you're
it sounded like you were doing peaking
for powerlifting so i'm guessing you're
focusing mostly on pressing movements
just because
you you know hoping to have the best
transfer of training effects i would say
most likely when you start to see people
creeping up in the like 25
30 sets per week it's an sfr thing you
might just want to explore some other
movements now
along those same lines within the
movements that you're already using
you might be like well these movements
don't me up that much well really
the issue is you're not yourself
up that much and you might have to
reevaluate and individualize your
technique where
you might be doing something that's
really good for strength like tucking
your elbows in
on like your incline bench press but
it's not as good for developing your
chest muscles during your hypertrophy
period so
there are some options there to explore
your technique even if you're
externally doing a really good job like
everything's good full range of motion
no you know posturing is good but you
might make some subtle changes that are
more specific for
muscle growth during your muscle growth
phases now another thing that i wanted
to touch on and again
this is um depends on how serious you
are about powerlifting
because this recommendation could go two
ways if you're somebody who is really
competitive
and trying to do the best that you can
in powerlifting you can just ignore this
i'm assuming that you're recreational
which is totally fine
and all good given that you seem to be
more of a slow twitch person you might
actually benefit from using that entire
rep range as well so you've been doing a
lot of 7-10
maybe use some movements in the 10 to 20
and just see how that goes you might
find that you can do
like infinity sets of seven to ten just
because they don't you up that much
but as soon as you do a couple sets at
10 to 20 you're like oh my god i've
never had this pump and this feeling in
my chest before
why because you're probably more slow
twitch in your chest
i'm not saying that you should do sets
of 20 for power lifting but if you're
only doing powerlifting recreationally
and your focus is you know on being a
jack buff guy
i would explore some of those higher rep
ranges and see if that makes a big
difference for you because you might
just find that you're more responsive
doing sets of 15 than doing sets of
seven
that's would be very in line with most
slow twitch people
very very good additions all right
next up is ed caldwell
this is actually a pretty simple answer
actually
you got him got him he says hey docs
i've trained indicted poorly for the
first six years into the physique game
has my rate of growth missed the newbie
gains opportunity especially since i'm
terribly underweight
thanks i appreciate uh you and all you
do so i actually have a really
interesting two-party answer to this
if you are uninjured and if you are
still relatively young
you can get almost all of the gains you
ever had coming to you genetically if
you just start doing the right stuff now
or better stuff now
period because the biggest uh
factor and how big you get is how growth
prone your muscles are
with the optimal resources and how many
satellite cells you have
where uh basically how many total
muscle cells can be incorporated to help
you grow extract because it seems like
the
satellite cells don't really replicate
much or only special conditions
so it's kind of like your growth
potential sort of genetically imbued
when you're you know mature adult so if
you're like
anywhere up until about 30 years of age
and you start doing things correctly
then you you have up until you're around
40 or so
to gain also you're sort of gonna go
gain anyway if you're not hurt like i
said in if you're relatively
under 30ish if you're over 30ish it
generally tends to be that you get great
gains when you figure out what's going
on
but as you reach 40 and beyond your
ability to grow just
gets hampered by the aging process and
you may never reach your all-time
potential so guys will say
you know i got into training at age 40
what kind of gains am i going to get
like you're probably not going to be mr
olympia right
and you're probably never going to look
like mr olympia would at age 50 when
you're age 50 even if you crank all the
gear and everything like that
but you're going to do really well for
yourself so if you're still around
something young under around 30
the beginner game waste of time stuff
you did really isn't that big of a waste
of time at all if any
okay but that is to say like if you or
 around and do stupid and be
super terribly underweight until you're
38 years old and finally figure out how
to eat
yeah you spent 18 years of not harming
yourself not destroying your
capabilities
but not using 18 years to continue to
gain and you only have
a certain number of years left yeah
excellent answer
um so ed i don't i'm going to give you
kind of the jocko willing style answer
here where um
i think a lot of people take this this
thought of like did i miss my
newbie games or did i miss my golden
zone
opportunity as kind of a moment to
almost sulk and feel sorry for yourself
what what is the alternative at this
point right like if you still want to be
jacked and you want to be fit go
train who cares right it doesn't matter
it's not one of those things where you
should you're not getting the results
you want now and you're looking back at
what you did you're going i
blew it oh even if you did blow it who
cares
you can fix it and just you can still
have a great athletic career and i'm not
trying to put you down
in any way that's not the point but i do
find that people who
are retrospectively looking and saying
did i miss my beginner
gains did i lose this main major
milestone
the answer is more often than not no
because you can just
keep you can just pick up wherever you
left off and start doing a better job
incrementally and you'll start
taking off and getting really great
results even if you did up
what's the alternative are you just
gonna sit around and do nothing just get
in there man you'll be fine
our next
question is all the way down it's the
third question
[Music]
oh man we have a ton of oh here we go
got it
all right he says legendary coach dan
john said the loaded carry does more to
expand better qualities than any other
single thing do you agree
now i'm not entirely sure he said that
um
but i will say this uh i'll let james
beat it up i'll just say my little piece
um no i vastly disagree it's actually a
relatively static movement when you
consider the number of limbs and joints
involved
if i had to pick one movement
that doesn't mortice benefited qualities
any other single thing i would pick the
uh power clean and jerk involves the
most
muscle groups and make guys
two opportunities for triple extension
bar turnover
all this other stuff that's the best one
movement but good news you don't ever
have to do one movement for sport
so it's a bit of a interesting question
but not with
much practical stuff i think loaded
carries have an incredibly limited
application
yeah well first of all you never trust
somebody with two first names
dan john um just kidding i think
i think the uh i think it's not only do
i disagree with that i think the loaded
carry is a largely
garbage exercise because it just creates
a ton of systemic fatigue and doesn't
really give you much payout outside of
somebody who's relatively untrained i
think dr mike's suggestion if we had to
narrow down maybe one or two exercises
that do have the biggest athletic bang
for your buck
cleaning jerk's not a bad option i would
severe slightly differently and say
sprinting sprinting is one of those
things like you can make almost anybody
a better athlete by having them do some
sprints and it's just one of those weird
things
it's one of the few things that does
kind of violate specificity in many
cases where you have athletes who don't
sprint like take volleyball for example
get them to sprint they'll do a little
bit better in volleyball for no apparent
reason
it's one that's just unclear probably
has to do with their ability to just
interact with the world
to some degree i have no idea but
sprinting would be up there on mine but
i think
dr mike's clean and jerk answer is also
very good
all right
last one last question for the day is
pico rodriguez
right below got it
pico has a really good question that's
super easy to answer hypothetically can
all people on aas reach an fmi of 25
or do genetics still play a role and
while we're on the topic i was reading
the rpdi 2.0 book
and was wondering does fractional
synthetic rate change when on these
substances do they need more or less
protein feedings because it's not matter
between protein synthesis is always
elevated
thank you team rp and then he says yes
greg just that doesn't have a 999
so okay um i'll take the last question
first does uh fractional synthetic rate
change run on substances yes it goes up
they just grow more muscle no matter
what you do right uh do they need more
or less protein feeding so here's the
cool thing
uh athletes on anabolics can benefit
from a protein but
anabolics also increase feed efficiency
more of the protein that you put into
your mouth
ends up uh being anabolized as a
fraction
so actually the two roughly cancel each
other out and you don't need any
different amount of protein than anybody
else
okay that actually actually kind of
works out super well secondly
the first question can all people on uh
anabolic energetic steroids reach f5
25 absolutely not absolutely not i would
say maybe
roughly a quarter in my estimate very
very ballpark back the envelope estimate
a quarter of all people who would ever
use gear to a high extent
will never reach an fmi of 25 and
roughly 5 if not 10 percent of people
who trade really hard with weights for
10 years will reach an fmi of 25 without
any gear at all
okay that's the harsh reality of
genetics in the world we live in okay
there are people in the npc national
physique committee
who are drug users okay who compete in
like
the rooster weight or some welterweight
some crazy welterweights are higher
lightweight bodybuilding
they're on they have gynum and
they're they've got ffmis of like 17
and they've been on for years some
people are just not cut out
to be gaining muscle and lots of folks
could be relatively
lots i mean like you know five percent
which is a lot of people
can be uh fmi of 25 if you're curious
about this
uh type in fmi25 greg knuckles he has
excellent series of articles where he
just beats the to death because
when after my stuff came out and people
were saying oh this was the cutoff for
drugs
it made him furious and he's brilliant
you don't want him furious
to meet him furiously he wrote like 10
articles about how stupid this is
played around this is like uh lyle
macdonald had his beef with him and
told greg he was forever you know going
to hate him and that he's stupid good
news greg
knuckles is a lot smarter than
mcdonald's right about almost all things
compared to live so
read that stuff for really in-depth
analysis of why the fmi 25
doesn't actually tell you if someone's
on gear now the average person you walk
into your gym
if they have an ffmi of 25 and they're
lean there's like a
pretty decent chance they're on gear
like at least 50 50 or higher
it's still not a limitless test but if
someone asks you that guy in gear
would you say is if it has an fmi of 25
here's the correct answer he said i
wouldn't bet against it
right would you would would you bet on
it like money i sure wouldn't
you know like that's just plain fact of
the matter and yes there are tons of
people
that use all the gear in the world and
never gets enough 25 tons and tons and
tons
that's just the that's just how it goes
people think gear
is this incredibly like it's just a
one-way ticket to being an isd pro
it's not man for here's the
thing for some people
it adds 50 pounds of muscle in two years
and for some people
it adds five pounds of muscle it just
makes you sore all over from the pinning
sites
when you have basically a low level
fluid all times and you have gyno
in your dick you know your nuts shrink
and you can't get hard anymore
that's all you get out of gear so that's
just a reality matter varying responses
at every single level
okay there was a couple points i wanted
to hit on there so like i hate this
these types of questions not i'm not
trying to
bash the question ask her but it's just
one of these like i feel like ffmi was
exclusively made for the natty or not
crowd
like that's all that's the only
direction this conversation ever goes
right it's never like
how is this useful it's always just
natty or not and i just don't give a
 it's just so annoying right
um two you talking about bets your boy
is a betting man
and i made some money this weekend on
the polish hammer yan vlhovich
yeah that one it's so i got like
four minutes until i need to go but real
quick
it's so scary to fight a guy who has
that
um glancing blow knockout power it's so
 because the other guy he's going
against
athletic god he pushed johnny's probably
technically beat jon jones on the
numbers
right and then the yambla hove is just
just like hey bonk
that's it like it's lights out okay last
i know you got to go
israel out of sonia audacious gyno
right i've never oh my god he didn't
have gyno before
and he shows up and he has gyno yeah
he's going to get a knock on his door
from usada almost certainly and for
those of you who didn't watch the post
fight presser one of the
one of the people were like hey israel
do you have like a a peck injury or
something going on some
people were commenting on twitter that
you have a weird peck thing going on and
he was very dismissive of the question
so not a bad policy i would say like if
he's getting popped
uh the guy he beat definitely needs to
get popped because that had
some
constantly like you know it's brazilian
but right like he's saying that so
like
but uh but yeah no and it's it was like
it was one of those where i was like
man like i guess he took the fight and
everything he didn't delay it
if i was his like friend i'd be like
israel it's time to get the surgery bro
you've got tons of money let's get the
surgery it's a two-week recovery after a
gyno surgery
just get it just get it over here and
it's so obvious
yeah you fight with your shirt you can't
wear a rash guard you can't hide
a little bit right a little bit of gyno
it's just like it's a man you know
whatever
and if you're in a higher weight class
it's whatever like who cares but this is
like he's lean
and there's just like one tit and you're
just like ah
so yeah i i just came out i was just
like ah
