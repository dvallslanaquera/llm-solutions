folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
strength training made simple video
number nine
how should you progress in your strength
training what do you do
to continue upwards and onwards to
actually get stronger
week to week to week because training
hard is one thing
but how much harder do you train than
the last time you trained in order to
ensure
the best possible results so first of
all where do you start
you want to choose a weight that's in
your target rep range so if you're doing
strength focused hypertrophy training
trying to get bigger for the purpose of
getting stronger sets of five to ten
basic strength is that's a three to six
roughly and then
peaking or limit strength is sets of one
to three so you pick a weight that's
challenging in that repetition range and
do
that weight for those reps for enough
sets
that gets you close to your maximum
recoverable volume at the end of the
mesocycle so
if you plan on training for five weeks
straight before you deload
that fifth week should be really pushing
your limits of recovery if it's not
you need to raise the overall volume of
work that you're doing now
that's where you choose your loads and
your volumes
and that first week you take those loads
and you do them
for around an rpe of seven okay
ideally you pick specific target reps
like sets of five
straight sets are totally fine or you
can sort of auto regulate your reps
based on rpe so you walk out with a set
of what's going to be something like
three to six
and you do reps until you hit your
target rpe of seven and as soon as you
hit let's say
five rp7 and you're done a lot of times
it's easier to just have preset number
of uh sets that you're doing in a preset
number of reps per set
and then once you hit those you modulate
the load as needed so for example if you
hit a set of five
and it's really not our p7 you really
mismanage the weight it's like an rp6
the next set of five put a little bit
more weight on the bar and if that's an
rp8 take a little bit more weight next
time so your average load is an rp7 but
you adjust every single set
the details aren't super important just
basically go in
and hit sets in that target rep range
for the rpe that you want
super important point number two you
write down all the reps
and all the weight and all the sets that
you've done then
how do you progress what do you do next
time so for next week's session
you want to add enough weight to the bar
weight
not reps strength comes from more load
on the bar you can get stronger by doing
something the same weight for more reps
but that's highly suboptimal you want
more load on the bar
so you're going to add enough weight to
keep the
rpe about the same okay rating perceived
exertion at least the same
never easier or harder
raising it by one so if you did an rp7
last week it's okay to do a load
that gets you another rp7 but it must be
more
or it can get you an rp8 we don't want
to jump from like seven to nine
because that accumulates way too much
fatigue it risks injury way too much you
want
slow and steady so whatever weight
you're going to increase it's going to
go up by enough
to either keep that rp the same seven if
you did seven last week if you did eight
last week eight again
or to go up by one so if you did seven
eight is okay
if you did eight nine is okay but never
more than that just a little bit more of
a challenge
pushing yourself a little bit more and
here's the big hard rule
your performance this week has to beat
your last week performance every single
time
if you have to do an rp10 from an rp7 to
beat your performance something is wrong
so it should be just a little bit of a
performance improvement
to get you either the same rpe or just
one
rp higher so trying just as hard and
improving or trying a little bit harder
and improving not blowing out all of
your gaskets
in that first or second session now
every single session
continues unlike that you look back at
the previous one you did let's say a
hundred pounds
for five reps rpe in in week one all
right for
seven rp that's five reps in week one
and then you need
five reps again same number of reps
probably an eight rp seven is fine two
but let's say eight
and in week two that means what do you
put on the bar
for week two well that's a guess and
check game that you have to do based on
your own insight
warming up is going to be a big help and
then trying to wait and see how it goes
you'll know the amount generally you can
put on the bar for many of us
it's like five pounds per week sometimes
it's two and a half pounds and for some
big lifts like deadlifts and stuff it
might be 10 or 15 pounds try
less first you can always put more
weight on in your next set in the set
after that if you really undershot your
rp
so week to week to week you're putting
more weight on the bar
you might be messing with sets probably
not messing with that number too much
same number of sets
a little bit more weight until you hit
your last week
and if on your last week you hit rp 10
and you're super gassed out and there's
no way you could do another week of prs
deload awesome your average volume was
good and your progression was good now
if that last week you hit an rp 10 you
hit a big pr
but next week you're like yeah i'm not
that fatigued i could try to hit a
little bit more weight than this
then deload anyway but for the next time
you do that progression
do a little bit more volume higher
number of sets on average
because you're probably under working or
extend your accumulation phase length
the length of your cycle instead of
doing five weeks up and one weeks down
maybe at the same rate or the same
amount of volume per week you could do
six weeks and get just a little more
that whole point there that last one is
to make sure you're challenging yourself
you should be deloading only when you
can't give any more to productive
training
you can still train productively still
train productively so
here's the deal you want small prs
a little bit more weight on the bar
every single time you come in
and when you can't add a little bit more
weight and work just a little harder
when you try to add more weight but the
reps fall off it's time to deload
time to drop that fatigue recycle repeat
and then onwards and upwards again from
there folks thanks for tuning in
see you next time for the next video
