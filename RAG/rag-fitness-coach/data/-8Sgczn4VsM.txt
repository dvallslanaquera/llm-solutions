hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization strength training made
simple number 12
how do beginners intermediates and
advanced folks train
differently when the goal is strength
training so first of all which one are
you
we have a real simple system here at rp
to consider it's not
dogma it's not set in stone but just
give this some thought you're a beginner
when you just get gains guaranteed from
even partial adherence to
the basics you show up and you squat two
times a week and your squat just keeps
going up
you don't have to think about it much
and you just keep getting gains you're a
beginner it doesn't matter how long
you've been lifting and yeah that means
some people after six years of training
are still beginners at heart that really
is what it means
intermediate you can call yourself that
when you've encountered probably your
first plateau
to when you know you did the basics
pretty well but like your squad or your
bench started to uh eek and then it
wasn't going up for a while and you had
to really rethink it
and rethinking usually means you really
have to start nailing the basics
well to continue to progress predictably
you got to really organize your training
a bit more organize your nutrition and
then you get these really good
solid gains once more if you've never
hit a plateau you're still a beginner a
pretty cool uh
sort of categorization there now you can
call yourself advanced and
when you hear this you're not going to
want to call yourself advanced that
if the details of the program aren't
really really good and set up super well
to your exact needs
no progress occurs okay and you'll
notice people who are advanced when they
do meets
they'll have some meats hit pr's and
some meats are pretty far
under on average they're hitting prs
over let's say two years
but like there's a as many down meats as
there are up meats
usually when you're intermediate it's
all up meats it's just steady progress
you look of course you're going to do
better at this next meet than the last
one when you're advanced that's not
quite clear a lot of things have to
align for that to happen
and when you're a beginner even if like
if you compete as a beginner you put
like 150 pounds on your total every
single time and
nobody kind of cares because it's like
duh you're a beginner right so that's
the categorization
we'd like for you to use so when you
hear these sort of tips on how to train
as a beginner immediate advanced
make sure you keep in mind sort of maybe
which one you are and
in your squat and bench and the other or
clean or whatever you may be different
one of these
your squat may be an advanced squat
because nothing seems to work unless you
get it perfectly right
and your bench might be a beginner bench
because everything works so there is a
little bit of individual lift treatment
here as well let's get right into it so
how on average just on average there's
some exceptions should beginners
probably train for best results well
they should probably do mostly sets of
five to ten reps why they give you a ton
of muscle size
and the number one problem in beginner
strength training is a lack of muscle
size
it doesn't really matter how strong you
make a muscle that's like this
thin as your finger you need a bigger
muscle so that's a 5 to 10 add tons of
size but
in that rep range in which they add tons
of strength as well and when you're a
beginner
just getting bigger is the absolute best
way to get stronger so most sets of five
to ten that means
pretty much no sets of one to three no
sets of three to six i know it's crazy a
lot of people get into strength training
because they like to grind those low rep
sets
this is a question for the best possible
long-term athlete development
i'm just telling you it's probably
optimal it's up to you
or whoever your coach to figure out if
they really want that or if they want to
engage in some bs
and just train for fun training for fun
is totally fine by the way
just know what you're trading off right
so mostly sets of five to ten you mostly
focus on the compound basics probably
just the core lifts
uh and a couple of derivatives very few
exercises because you want beginners to
get
really good at the basics because if you
do too many exercises that confuses them
it doesn't solidify the technique for
the basics nearly as well
on that note you want to really focus on
technique beginners should add load to
the bar only when their technique is
stable
and good or improving if their technique
ever goes south in a session the next
session
no load additions same load show me that
your technique can be better
when you do that you have earned
yourself the right to put more weight on
the bar so with beginners they can
quickly get into candy cane deadlifts
and
rising from the grave squats and all
kinds of terrible crap
just by pushing the load because their
technique isn't solidified yet so
technique is always number one here to
that end
you want to avoid rpe 10 training
because technique tends to break down
also beginners make such easy gains you
don't need our p10 training to push the
pace at all
you also want to avoid near mrv training
much of the time where you get a
performance decline so you don't want to
smash
beginners with tons of volume give them
a decent amount get good gains going and
just don't touch a whole lot maybe
progress a little bit on volume every
now and again see how they respond but
if they really start to flutter
pull back there's no reason to push them
because you want them to have a really
good time
not encounter crazy recovery problems
not get hurt and solidify their
technique and again
ultra high volume training degrades
technique by adding tons of fatigue for
these folks
this probably means whole body sessions
all the main lifts
every single time you come in it's a
whole body session probably three to
four times a week you don't want any
more than that because it's
easy to burn them out now what about
intermediates mostly sets of five to ten
still because they still need tons of
mass but now they're doing tons of sets
of three to six as well
developing that basic strength often in
a basic manner we'll do three months of
sets of five to ten
and two months of sets of three to six
and then go back to sets of five to ten
yeah you can peak and begin to peak them
with sets of one to three true peaking
faces but not too often because
intermediates a lot of times
get carried away and competing too much
and testing too much versus actually
training
remember when you squat a mediocre
amount testing it all the time it's just
gonna be like hey
you're still mediocre congratulations
what you do to
leave mediocre behind leave humanity
behind bro i gotta throw that in
uh what you do to leave mediocre behind
is actually train is actually get better
at the stuff right it's like you want to
get good at math and you just keep
taking math tests that's not how you get
good at math you open up the book
and you go through the practice problems
you actually learn the lectures yeah
that sucks and maybe it's not as fun as
taking a test and seeing where you're at
but testing and training are two very
different things
so you have to take intermediates who
are excited about testing their newfound
strength
raining it a little bit let them test
every now and again but mostly trained
most instead of
five to ten mostly sets of three to six
now intermediates
can really expand the plethora of
exercises they use to try to find the
exercises that are the best
stimulus to fatigue ratios for them to
enhance their strength like some people
they'll do close grip benching and
they're just not feeling it weirdness in
the shoulders they don't connect to the
movement
but if they do normal grip benching and
they do some jm presses they're just
grooving on those exercises
they just fit their body and their
preferences you
will never know that if as a beginner
you only ever did regular bench and a
little bit of close grip bench you'll
never even know what a jam press is so
try a bunch of different exercises and
see what grooves
for your strength and strength
hypertrophy progress then by the time
you're advanced you'll know what really
works for you and know how to build
programs that aren't guesses because
remember
in a beginner guessing is fine
intermediate guessing is part of the
process for advanced guessing will get
you in real deep shit
because you just you know everything
needs to align remember
to hit pr guesses by definition don't
align but for every now and again when
you get a chance by accident
so now that we're talking about doing
more exercises okay that's great but for
the core movements and these other
exercises
intermediate's going to be training hard
so most mesocycles
are pushed from an rp of 7 to an rp of
10
focusing on breaking barriers towards
the end of each meso the end of each
mesocycle even
a lot of the middle is going to be
weights you've never touched before in
your life
really good technique no bs but you make
little pr's little pr's little pr's
intermediate times are great times
because you're just always getting
stronger bit by bit you look back over
the air like oh my god i'm 50 pounds
stronger on each lift
that's awesome the way that happens is
pushing forward
right you've never squatted 400 pounds
and there's four plates on the bar for
the first time
like holy crap like wait do i have to do
this yes
that is the time if you're a beginner a
lot of working on technique and a lot of
stuff happens
sort of by itself you don't really have
to put the pedal to the metal because
you get gains anyway as an intermediate
it's time to really gut up and
especially towards the end of the
mesocycle put it all
in which is super fun and because your
technique is so good now because you did
a good job as a beginner
no problem your technique doesn't break
down when you get fatigued so no big
deal
on that note getting fatigued you're
going to move from minimum effective
volume to maximum recoverable pretty
much in each mesocycle at least for the
hypertrophy and strength ones now
towards the end
of your intermediate phase you're going
to get in a situation where the fatigue
just from
the addition of load alone is going to
take you from mev at the beginning of
the message cycle or accumulation phase
to mrv at the end so you're not going to
have a situation where you're doing
three sets and then four sets in the
five sets and then six and then d load
and media mrv
you're gonna have a session a situation
which you're doing four sets and four
sets and four sets and four sets and
then your mrv comes down to you and then
you have to deal which is great
actually keeps the training process
simpler at that point you don't have to
add sets anymore you start with the same
number of sets roughly
that you end the mesocycle and the only
changes that you're adding load and
you'll know when
that's a possibility because trying to
add sets simply won't work
you'll over do your fatigue and your
performance will drop and be like well
it looks like i can't add sets anymore
as far as frequency intermediates will
train each movement two to four times a
week so you
bench two to four times a week squat two
to four times a week deadlift on the
slightly lower end of that so on and so
forth
and it's gonna happen in a total of four
to six sessions intermediates can handle
more work the work capacity is better
and they need more work because
now they're pushing it further and they
need more training to fill out their
genetic potential so it's going to have
to be more training a lot of times
folks will send me a program every now
and again to review and be like hey like
i'm intermediate
almost advanced i'm training three times
a week what do you think and i'm like i
think you're not training enough right
so at some point you gotta train more
now on the note of training more
eventually become advanced
what do you do then well advanced folks
generally have tons of muscle size
already
so they're gonna be training mostly with
sets of three to six uh
and only sets of five to ten if they
need to reclaim size like a lot of times
after a peaking phase
and an active rest phase you've lost a
little muscle size so just one mesocycle
of sets of five to ten hypertrophy
strength can reclaim and add on a little
bit of muscle so
you can have another productive strength
phase ahead or
if they want to move up a class right so
if you're a 220 pound power lifter you
want to move up to a 242 pound class
then yeah you're gonna have to do lots
of sets of five to ten because that's a
lot of muscle to add but sometimes
folks that are advanced or really
wiggled into their weight class and
there's just not a need slash even
logical
ability to do the sets of five to ten
because it's like well i just want to
build more muscle like well you're
already like 11
body fat you can't get much lead in that
without sacrificing strength
and you're already at your weight cap
there's just only so much hypertrophy
training you can do and you can do some
every now and again but most of your
training is going to be basic strengths
that's a three to six
and of course as an advanced individual
you're probably going to be competing
more often
or at least the competitions are very
important when they do happen and then
of course you do plenty of peaking sets
of one to three
as far as exercises as an intermediate
remember you explored
the landscape of which exercises give
you your best sfrs by the time you're
advanced you should know them
damn well and stick mostly to them
someone's going to be like hey incline
dumbbell press right for your work like
nope
doesn't carry over for anything it hurts
my shoulder like how do you know that
well i tried it for four years as an
intermediate
now i know that you know why grip
incline barbell
is really my jam if that's the movement
we want so you have to know all your
stuff
and of course you're going to start to
vary some things more you're going to
vary our petition ranges
and intensities throughout the week in
order to manage fatigue and percent of
stimulus
this is why advanced training is a
little bit tricky you can't just go all
out recover all out recover
there's going to have have to be some
wiggle room so for example if you do a
heavy benching workout
you might do some light assistance work
at the end the next workout might be
lighter benching because you simply
can't bench heavy again you're not
recovered but maybe
more intense assistance work the workout
after that might be heavy benching again
so a lot more variation here for
advanced lifters that wouldn't occur for
beginners
or for intermediates most advanced
training on the
relative effort front is going to be
between 8 and 9 rpe
7rp might be a little bit too easy for
advanced to get their best games okay at
that point it might just maintain things
10 rp is okay but it's occurring on more
rare occasions because rp 10 for advance
is first of all a distinct injury risk
rises are so
fucking strong and second of all it
comes with a massive fatigue toll that
you may not want to pay even in the
middle of a training cycle
which is to say that a meat prep cycle
for an advanced person
two mesocycles or say one mesocycle of
hypertrophy training
two mesocycles of basic strength and one
mesocycle of
uh peaking training that whole thing
rp-10 might be hit only at the meat
and the rest is rp's eights and nines
for the most part was threes and sixes
to recover every now and again give that
some thought so
it's pretty interesting as an advanced
person
very likely your ability to progress in
sets is going to be nil the fatigue is
too high
only load additions occur week to week
which is totally fine sometimes we're
very advanced
as load goes up sets might actually go
down a little bit
to let you really have the best
performance towards the end without a
ton of cumulative fatigue
that happens sometimes and as far as
training
well each movement pattern is probably
going to want to be trained two to three
times a week notice four is off the
table because a lot of times you're so
strong
that you can't recover from four pushes
or four leg workouts or four
pulling workouts it's just gonna have to
be two to three maybe you can do four
but a technique only a recovery only
session
being one of those not for overloading
workouts that entire time or
per movement pattern and how many
sessions well honestly
for the very advanced to be their best
five to ten weekly sessions which what
do you mean ten that means you have some
two a day strategically in order
to make sure that you get all of the
volume that you need and the frequency
you need
but if you try to do that and just in a
smaller number of workouts
what ends up happening is each workout
gets so long the systemic fatigue makes
the tail end of the workout just
crap so for example an advanced lifter
they can't do like a squatting movement
a pulling movement and a pushing
movement productively in one workout
because the squatting movement and the
pulling movement tire them out so much
the pushing movement is going to be too
light to even be effective and it's just
a waste of time
so what you do instead with them is if
that's the worker that has to happen on
a monday the way your schedule is worked
out
you take it you split it so what you do
is heavy squatting
in the morning with let's say moderate
pulling
break for six hours or something come
back and do
moderate pushing in the pm because you
had that break in between workouts
you're refreshed you can actually have a
productive workout on all three fronts
instead of just two much more advanced
there's a reason they're called that
folks thanks for tuning in see you next
