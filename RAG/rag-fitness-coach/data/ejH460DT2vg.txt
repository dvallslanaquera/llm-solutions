7 days a week no rest Days 7 days a week
no rest days it's actually a bad idea
your body needs rest and Recovery it's
when it actually does most of its growth
I would recommend the most advanced
folks that are seeking the highest
levels of adaptation to their physiques
and muscularity train at most uh 6 days
a week but uh most folks would get the
best results training uh somewhere
between four and 5 days a week so s days
a week is generally a bad
idea
