hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
some of you would think i would get
tired of saying that and in fact you're
correct
i got to get a new video intro maybe we
could have a cool graphics
dinosaur eating a shark the shark has a
bomb in its mouth though so
in any case not as sweet but still cool
let's talk about
how to use your pump that's right the
pump arnold yeah
pump is like calming that whole thing
using your muscle pump
to partially inform you about how to
regulate your training volume
essentially how pumped up are you what
does that mean for what how many sets
of an exercise or a muscle group should
you do
next session next week so on and so
forth
this is only for hypertrophy training
not for strength training
so when you comment for sure a comment
for the algorithm if you're like what
about strength training i don't know
jk we we can do this for strength
training but the pump is not very
relevant for strength training so
there's your quick answer
three things we're going to talk about
first what is the pump
specifically at a physiological level
but why do we care
second how to use the pump as a partial
tool
and lastly how to take that pump as a
tool
and apply it to hypertrophy training to
auto regulate volume
specifically so here we go what is the
pump why do we care
the pump is the swelling of the muscle
cell itself
and the swelling of the whole area with
fluid added to
all of the space that's not just the
cell itself the extracellular space so
on and so forth the swelling
of the muscle cell and all of the
structures or most of the structures
around it people used to say like oh i'm
just putting some blood into the muscle
the pump is not just blood it's a bunch
of different kinds of fluid
including blood if you have a lot of
blood going through a muscle
you can get that going just by moving
your shit up and down
if you want to let's say get a lot of
blood moving through your quads just go
take a walk
or jog you don't get pumped from walking
or jogging i sure hope if you do
go see a cardiologist but if you are
just moving around not training hard not
taking things close to failure
then you get a crapload of blood running
through that muscle it doesn't cause a
pump a pump is a little bit more
complicated than that
a pump occurs when blood and fluids go
into the muscle at a certain rate but
they leave at a much slower rate so you
get the swelling effect i look if
if your calves start to swell up like
crazy when you're walking you'd be at
least a little bit concerned
however if they didn't swell up like
crazy when you were training them for
size you may also be a little bit maybe
not concerned but like god damn it this
training's not going well that's a
preview of something we're gonna
conclude based on the pump in just a
little bit
so the pump is indicating that a
disruptive event has
occurred in the muscle cells probably
because lots of tension has been
generated like if you want bigger pumps
go heavy like if someone cans you a five
pound dumbbell to curl and they're like
get a pump you're like
fuck what but if they hand you 25 you're
like all right pump city here we go
lots of metabolite summation especially
metabolism
the pump and the burn are incredibly
well correlated that is
sets that cause a profound burn
and should generate a shitload of
tension and take you close to failure
those are all direct hypertrophy signals
by the way
they tend to cause the best pumps all
right it would be really tough
to get your best pump ever without
feeling the burn in the last couple of
reps so metabolite summation literally
and there's chemical mechanisms for
when you generate a ton of metabolites
in the area of the muscle
a ton more fluid flows in to essentially
dilute them and that's part of the way
you get a pump not the only way but part
of the way
so when you have a big pump you're
probably generating a lot of metabolites
which we'll get to in a bit
is probably a good thing for hypertrophy
and lastly
a pump also occurs because damage has
been initiated right
in in a similar way that when you hurt
something
it swells up to a smaller extent this
happens when you're physically hurting
and damaging and ripping the muscles
when you're training so a lot of that
pump actually is from the damage
secondary to the damage itself so when
you're getting a pump
there is a decent possibility that more
growth
has been stimulated and caused
right first of all the pump has been
investigated directly
cell swelling itself if you swell a
muscle cell
hypertrophy starts to elevate so cell
swelling itself the literal pump itself
causes muscle growth
probably just a little bit of growth
though not a ton however
indirectly we know we get the biggest
pumps when we have high tension
that gets you close to failure which
means high tension in the fastest motor
units which are most growth responsive
a ton of metabolites being generated
really close to the burn like oh my god
my fucking quads
and possibly some damage as well which
occurs from
tons of tension to metabolites over
multiple sets
that nasty level of disruption causes
hypertrophy
damage probably doesn't cause
hypertrophy itself or maybe just a
little but sure as hell tension and
metabolites do and they also cause
damage
so when you have a gnarly pump you can
be pretty sure that there's lots of
tension and metabolites going on
and that you took the sets appropriately
close to failure
and for a decent enough volume that
that's a good enough level of disruption
that
actually causes growth not only does the
pump cause growth directly
when you have a big pump all the things
tension
uh metabolite burn and proximity failure
and so on and so forth are probably also
there in large
factor and when that's the case you're
probably getting a lot of hypertrophy
now the pump is only a partial tool
we'll have future videos to talk about
different other tools
that in the session in the moment itself
or a few days later can tell us if we
did a good job stimulating hypertrophy
the pump is just one of them
it's a partial tool it's not perfect a
pump of having a good pump
cannot guarantee you that you're growing
muscle and the correlator is also false
so
not getting a good pump doesn't
guarantee you didn't cause a lot of
really good muscle growth
however the pump does
have some utility right but
it does it should be used with other
factors which talk about later like
disruption
how much damage you retain so and so
forth performance is a big one
but it can be an important indicator
that we don't just want to ignore
completely and here's how we use it
before you use a pump to adjust your
volume
you got to understand that your
technique has to be really good
and your rir has to be accurate
which is to say your technique has to be
locked in place to be stimulating the
muscles you want let's say the chest so
your
fly technique has to be good and you've
got to be going hard that's a high
quality set as i said with good
technique
and every set is taken close to failure
if you're not doing that shit don't
worry about your pump it might not tell
you anything at all
if you're training hard and with good
technique
then you can use the pump to auto
regulate volume
in future sessions and future weeks and
here's how you do it
if you do a muscle group let's just keep
it super simple and save with one
exercise
you're doing leg press and you're uh
training your quads
let's say if you barely get a pump or no
pump at all
what's the chance that that is causing
the most high degree of growth
for that session man it's not that high
because apparently the tension wasn't
super high or there wasn't enough
represented there was barely a
metabolites there's barely any
disruption there's better than a direct
pump where the hell you need growth from
can you imagine doing a super hard leg
press workout getting no pump and being
like fuck yeah gonna get jacked ah seems
unlikely right
so if there's barely any pump or no pump
at all you can probably add a set
at least to that session next week so
let's see with two sets of leg press
you're like man i don't really have a
big pump
it's probably okay next week to add
three because it'll probably give you a
better pump
probably be more tension etc etc and all
that stuff that causes growth leading to
more growth
if you have a pretty good pump in a
session but it's not like a world
altering pump it's not the best pump
ever
then you can just repeat that same
amount of sets next week and increasing
the load and reps will make it a little
harder which is good
or you can add a set next week but no
more okay and this is a big mistake
people make all the time they get a
pretty decent pump like look that was
sweet four sets decent pump
and next week they're like fucking seven
like what the fuck seven four was
already really good maybe five maybe
still four
but don't go six seven eight some crazy
shit because that'll almost certainly be
too much
another way to look at it is look if
four did a pretty decent job
why are you trying to do double that
amount or one and a half times that
amount what do you think you're getting
out of that super decent job it doesn't
work like that
pretty soon you're damaging so much that
you might not be growing a ton and we'll
get to that in just a sec more detail
if the pump is very good or amazing if
you do let's say four sets of
like leg press we'll just keep the
example to one thing keep it simple
and you fucking get off the leg press
you're like fuck my quads this is
fucking sweet you could barely bend them
you're like dude gnarly pump
man there's just no reason to change the
shit next week
your load is going up anyway or your
reps are going up anyway just like
normal progress
just keep it at four if next week
four sets you do again and the pumps
like meh
then you can go to five the week after
but if you've got a good thing don't
fuck it up
lastly if you have an earth shattering
pump
like the pump were like dude i think my
pecs are fucking just can't move anymore
it's like your skin feels like it's
like breaking if you get that kind of
pump
you might actually be doing so much work
and so close to failure and so many
metabolites
everything else that you're generating
an unsustainable amount of damage
possibly right you can be re
ready to repeat that session next week
so a little bit more load a little bit
more reps
but the same number of sets let's say
six sets in the leg press just fucking
blew you up
yeah maybe you do success next week but
be prepared
pumps like that often cause a crazy
amount of soreness
and you might have to do a lighter
session or modify your next leg workout
because it was just too much and then
the next week when it comes time to leg
press again because you probably train
legs like two or three times a week
the next week you're like man last time
six sets got me a crazy pump
way too much soreness it couldn't
recover on time maybe it's a good idea
to do five
you go back to five you still get a
sweet pump not exactly the perfect pump
an awesome pump but then you don't get
super sore or just get sore for a couple
days
heal next uh on time for the next
workout and everything's super groovy
right so point d here on your powerpoint
slides that you see
it earth shattering pumps are
probably stimulating as much hypertrophy
as you're able to do at any one time
but because they cause so much damage
they're not sustainable so
people say like how do you know when
it's time to leave the gym and a lot of
people be like a fucking train until my
pumps
fucking annihilates me like uh that's a
good time to train once
good way to train one time but generally
speaking
you know you kind of want to back off a
little bit and just get really good
solid pumps
that do two things one grow plenty
muscle and also allow you to recover
enough to get more solid pumps more
solid pumps more solid pumps
the alternative is to get crazy psycho
pump get so much damage you need to fuck
up your next training session
and then you keep going like this and
half your training sessions are no good
because they're just recovery sessions
that you probably don't want to do
so this is a good way to use the pump to
auto regulate volume
there will be other variables introduced
in future videos this isn't the only one
but this is kind of a partially
informative way
to shit test if you're doing enough
volume or not and the extremes are the
most productive
so i'll give you two examples if you get
no pump at all
at all from like normal sets of five to
thirty reps
man you probably just didn't do enough
okay the chances that
doing more volume will benefit you is
pretty fucking high
on the other hand if you get a psychotic
earth shattering pump
you can barely fucking move the chances
that you're not doing enough volume to
grow
are fucking damn near zero so at least
on those extremes the pump is super
super informative and can be used really
well
next time we'll take a look at how
muscle disruption
can also be used to inform whether we
need to stay at the same volume next
week
go up or go down and i'll see you then
oh
enjoy your pump
