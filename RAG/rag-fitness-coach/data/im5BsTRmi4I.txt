the idea that your body will just stop
responding to a given lift and that you
need to be constantly
shocking your muscles into new growth
that has no real physiological basis
what's up guys sean nalawani
realscienceathletics.com and in this
video today i want to explain
why uh as the title of the video says i
did
the exact same back workout consisting
of the same four exercises in the same
order
for around three years straight in my
earlier lifting days
and actually why i did pretty much the
same workout for most of my muscle
groups aside from
some minor variation here and there i
might have slightly mixed things up
now and then but i would say that it was
probably the same like 90 of the time
and i built the majority of my initial
muscle base
training that way before i jump into it

and let's get started now first off this
video here is not
specifically about the subject of back
training um though i will give you the
exact routine that i use in a minute
here this is actually about the subject
of exercise variation in general
and secondly i'm not recommending that
you go ahead and follow the exact same
workout for three years straight okay
this is from
my earlier lifting days around 15 to 20
years ago
and i do program in more exercise
variety now i'm just using this to
demonstrate
a general point so why did i do the
exact same workout over and over again
the simple answer is that i was
consistently coming back to the gym
stronger
over and over and over again and so i
never felt that there was any real need
to change anything
the exercises that i had covered all the
major muscles of my back
using basic movement patterns i would
train hard focus
on doing just a little bit more each
time by either adding an extra rep with
the same weight
or increasing the weight itself i would
rest i would go back the following week
and as long as my nutrition and my rest
were on point i'd always be a little bit
stronger than the previous workout
so i would do a little bit more and
again i'd get a little bit stronger
rinse and repeat and since size and
strength are for the most part directly
correlated
i would consistently grow bigger and
bigger as well now that doesn't mean
that i made perfect linear progress for
three straight years because there's
always going to be phases where
things go off track for whatever reason
you kind of end up having to start back
up again but as long as i was consistent
then my size and strength would
continually go up without varying any
exercises at all
and back then uh my back was even more
developed than it is now
because as i've said before i don't
train to be as big as possible or to
look like a full-on bodybuilder at this
point in my training
i'm more about sort of going for the
leaner middle ground look
for the time being i don't have many
clear pictures from my earlier lifting
days but you can kind of get an idea
here
here's a rear lat spread i was 19 years
old here um here's a couple fuzzy
webcam pictures from back when i was 17.
but you get the general idea
and then this is more so what my back
looks like now
which i'm generally pretty happy with i
could definitely still make some
improvements
but point being that this is me carrying
even less overall mass than i did
back when i was doing the same workout
every single week and the goal was to be
as big as possible
but the first main point here is that
that is the ultimate gauge in terms of
knowing
that what you did in the previous
workout successfully stimulated muscle
growth if you come back to the gym
and you're stronger in some measurable
capacity than you were
in the last workout whether that's being
able to lift
say five pounds more or even two and a
half pounds more or doing
one to two extra reps with the same
weight or even doing just half a rep
more
with the same weight if you are stronger
now than you were last time
then that means that your previous
workout was a success you triggered
those muscle building adaptations in the
gym
and your nutrition and your rest were
sufficient to actually carry out the
growth process and that's why you're
stronger now
so if you're performing a given training
routine and you're continually coming
back to the gym
stronger then as long as that routine
has enough exercise variety to fully hit
all the muscles you're targeting then
there really is no explicit need to
change things
now i'm not saying that changing things
is bad you know you can do it for mental
variety if you want or you could argue
that
certain exercises hit different muscles
in a slightly different way
depending on the angle and so mixing up
your lifts over time would allow for
more complete development
i really think that depends on the
specific muscle that we're talking about
um and the current routine that you're
doing now just in terms of
how much actual variety there is um in
the first place
but in this endless information age with
youtube and social media
where you're being exposed to a million
different exercise variations and a
million different
uh training styles and routines and
where it's so easy to get caught up in
that sort of
shiny object syndrome where you're
bouncing around all over the place
trying to find the perfect exercises and
the perfect routine
just remember if you are consistently
coming back to the gym
stronger than you were last time that
means that your program is working you
are on the right track maybe it can be
optimized further
but it is working nonetheless and you
are consistently going to be gaining
new muscle from it and the next point
and i know some people are going to
disagree with this
especially certain youtubers out there
whose entire shtick is to show you some
brand new set of
five unique exercises every three days
but i would say that generally speaking
you don't actually need
as much exercise variation as you
probably think and you definitely don't
need to be constantly mixing up your
exercises all the time
again if you want to change things
around uh just for the sake of variety
because it keeps
your training interesting then that's
okay but from a pure muscle building
standpoint
if you have a set of movements in place
that effectively train the muscles that
you're trying to target
you train close to failure to trigger an
adaptive response you focus on
slowly progressing over time to push
those adaptations further and further
your body is not going to magically stop
responding to a given movement
strength increases do slow down over
time in general that's normal
um just like your muscles gains will but
your body does not know or
care what specific exercise you're doing
all it directly experiences
is the amount of stress on the muscle
and then it adapts accordingly to that
it's a survival response and if the
stress is gradually increasing
and you're giving your body all the rest
and the nutrients that it needs then
it's in your body's best
interest to adapt to that it doesn't say
oh he's been using a barbell
at a 20 degree angle for too many weeks
straight now let's put things on hold
and stop all the growth until he
switches to a dumbbell or a cable
at a 45 degree angle now you might have
certain weak links in a particular
exercise that need to be addressed
separately or if a given lift isn't
increasing then
you might need to just adjust your
overall training parameters in terms of
volume or frequency
or other non-weight training factors
like your nutrition your cardio volume
stress levels
rest etc but the idea that your body
will just stop responding to a given
lift and that you need to be constantly
shocking your muscles into
new growth that has no real
physiological basis
i mean if that were true then power
lifters wouldn't be able to train for
decades
and continually increase their barbell
bench uh barbell squat and barbell
deadlift
and in terms of the exact back routine
that i use because i'm sure some of you
are curious this isn't necessarily the
routine that i would give to someone now
and i generally
don't program in conventional deadlifts
for back training for reasons that i've
explained previously
but in any case the routine was
deadlifts
weighted pull-ups bent over dumbbell
rows and smith machine shrugs
and always in that order i'm even just
saying that brings back memories because
that was just my staple routine that i
did for so long
and i used to train hit style at that
time i was a big arthur jones
and mike menser fan when i was younger
so low volume very high intensity
i don't train that way now in general i
do mix it in here and there
um and i also don't advise that novices
train that way
but the way i did things was two sets
for each exercise with five to seven
reps per movement
except for the shrugs where i would
usually do eight to 10 reps
so not only did i do the exact same
exercises but i also used the exact same
volume
and the same rep range as well and i got
pretty damn big and pretty strong for a
natural lifter especially at that young
age
now could i have gotten better results
or even faster results if i had done
something differently
maybe but the point is just that
exercise variety is not some sort of
holy grail or something that you need to
obsess over
and actually my girlfriend yuan she's a
good example of this as well
she had never lifted a weight in her
life prior to meeting me
she started lifting 10 months ago on an
upper lower split and she's been doing
the exact same exercises in the same
order for that entire time
she uses a basic double progression
scheme and she continues to get stronger
and stronger and her body composition
continues to improve and improve she's
never hit a plateau and she has no
interest
in changing to a different routine for
the time being because the one she's
doing right now works you know if it's
not broken
don't fix it uh that doesn't mean that
we won't adjust things at some point
but she's gone 10 months making very
significant progress
doing the exact same thing over and over
so
there's certainly nothing wrong with
exercise variety and mixing things up
over time but you have to let go of this
idea
that you need tons of novelty and you
need to be constantly mixing things
around
especially if you're a novice once
you're more advanced and sure
you know you can do whatever you want at
that point but definitely in the
at least novice to intermediate stage
you will make excellent gains by just
focusing on a solid
structured program and hammering the
fundamentals over and over again
and if you want to grab what i consider
to be the optimal training system in
order to accomplish that then you can
