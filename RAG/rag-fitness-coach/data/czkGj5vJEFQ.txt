this is my favorite full body workout
made for Pure bodybuilding we start with
three sets of crossbody lat pull rounds
which offer an insane stretch on the
lats then we do low incline Smith
machine press for the PEC shoulders and
triceps these are safer to push to
failure than free weight presses and I
find them easier to recover from then
it's on to machine hip adductions to
Target the inner thighs which add a ton
of leg Mass from the front next up is
leg press another low impact compound
exercise that we can push super hard
without causing tons of fatigue and then
we finish with some lying face PS for
the rear delts midback and some cable
crunches for the ABS any missing muscles
can be picked up on another full body
day
