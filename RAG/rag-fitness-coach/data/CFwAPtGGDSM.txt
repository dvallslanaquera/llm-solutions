hey it's us mike and james mike's in the
international space station i'm i don't
know where i am i'm at home there's no
visitors it's crazy mike how's it going
oh oh there's a there's a delay in
transmission because he's out in space
see the zero gravity flat earth there is
no gravity or space or whatever
okay real talk every time that the uh
you and i have joked about this before
every time the thing comes on
where it's like um
the meeting is now recruiting it's not
recording i always want to like be like
this like
oh oh
uh yes i was preparing some noodles
under the computer for quarter profits
look good huh team
okay so before i signed on for the
webinar i did i i had like a classic
james moment i did like my second
workout and i was it was pretty good and
i was like okay great i'm gonna make
some food right before we do the webinar
so i'm not like trying to eat or
anything and i made a big old like bowl
of ramen and it looks really good and i
put my like portioned out my chicken and
i put it in there oh no
that just sounds like it's right so i'm
looking at it it looks wonderful chicken
spoiled
and i was just like god
damn it
i have to throw it away
that's blow i know and i didn't
have enough time to do like another
another round of cooking so then i just
had like a typical james crapola meal
actually i think i ate some of mila's
leftover food that's what i ate
literally
three-year-old by the way three-year-old
friend of the family so yeah
um
that blows i've had that happen at least
once where i made the massive like
mike's big bowl of rice and slaw and
meat and i tried the first piece of meat
and i was like
now what dump and i always ask like my
wife i'm like crystal should i eat this
and she's like she smells it she's like
no no
she has a real high tolerance she'll eat
whatever and not get sick and i might i
have a little bit made stomach it'll
blow up asap so i'm like you know i've
had food james you drove me to the
hospital once when i had food poisoning
east tennessee state university oh yeah
i'm interested in having food poisoning
i mean she's been having it as few times
as uh possible forever so
you also now have like the rice the
korean rice cooker from the future it
basically just like bends time and space
and it makes you rice it's it's
incredible takes your rice before you
wanted it you're like yeah and it like
yells at you too it's like hey this rice
has been ready for a while you dick get
it in korean so you feel extra stupid
i gotta get me one of those it's amazing
it's amazing i suck at cooking rice i
always turns out like crunchy and awful
rice cooker's unbelievable there are
three settings for language english who
you'd have been saying to choose because
it doesn't tell you anything you need to
know it's read the label you put
the rice in you know when it's done it
says a bunch of shade in korean korean
and then chinese and i was like like
mandarin chinese yeah i think which
language sounds cool and then i looked
up where the cooker's from and it's made
in korea so i was like i want the native
language i want the traditional
dude it's so sweet i was so jealous when
we came over to visit i was like oh that
thing's awesome
all my wife
because she's asian and she knows
like that i don't know why
charlie looked down upon me for not
knowing of its existence of course oh i
know exactly
you really really you don't know
oh my god really oh like what do you
mean a pot houston who's like oh
that's you can't tell asian like
that
all right
the questions the question
our birth question is from
oh henrik anderson our favorite this was
a hearty 50 up folks
that's a lot a lot of yes people are
getting the message about the up folks
all right
well it's an interesting one too
yeah yeah hormone regulation including
testosterone production and other
aspects of overall health is highly
dependent on fat intake
not highly but yes somewhat
but doesn't matter where the fats come
from saturated unsaturated trans fat as
an example can most of my fats come from
like cheese sour cream similar foods
with low saturated fat do you really
need to focus on where my fats come from
or is it just whatever for the average
mostly healthy person so it really
really depends on how much fat you're
eating uh first thing so if you're
eating a huge amount of fat which is
totally healthy in the context of a
calorie-controlled diet lower carb
higher fat lower protein higher fat then
where your fats come from starts to add
a lot you want most of your fats to come
from poly and monounsaturated sources
that are generally things like olive oil
canola oil nuts not butters um avocado
stuff like that and then a smaller
fraction can come from saturated fat and
other sources
if you eat very little fat it'd be very
difficult to get your fat from anything
you choose so for example a lot of
bodybuilders most of their fats come
from ancillary uh sources like meats and
eggs with your split 50 50 usually
between saturated monounsaturated making
them not not entirely unhealthy if
you're gonna add fats as a person who
eats a pretty low fat diet you should
add probably either monounsaturated or
polyunsaturated rich sources because
you're probably getting enough saturated
now if you do some kind of weird diet
where you reduce your saturated fat
intake substantially so very very low
you could be suffering a small um
at a small expense to your testosterone
production that's not overly confirmed
but tenuous but the good good bet has
you eating at least some saturated fat
so i would say that's probably
uh where that my understanding is on
that we'll see if james can correct me
or add anything but i will say our book
at renaissance prioritization
understanding healthy eating and
actually in renaissance diet 2.0 get
into all the fats and health stuff uh no
problem so get those if you want to know
more buy our stuff we need money god
damn it
indeed yeah so um in terms of like uh
just kind of homeostatic regulation
if you eat kind of like relative what
you know most kind of a normal diet
where you have some things like some
cheeses or some dairy and some protein
you're mostly going to tick all the
boxes for homeostatic stuff right you're
not going to you don't necessarily have
to target specific fats unless you in
like a heavily fat restricted diet like
a bodybuilding prep or something where
now you might just have to think about
it a little bit more mostly we just we
we say like don't eat a lot of likes
cheese sour cream
saturated fat just because at some point
it's probably not great for your health
um and even then
if you maintain a healthy body weight
body comp and you're a very active
person does it matter a whole lot ah
maybe not um it's just probably one of
those like prophylactic things like
maybe don't eat a ton of saturated fat
if you don't necessarily have to but if
you're eating things like cheese like
you're going to get all the fats
generally that you need from a mixed
diet unless you're like really really
heavily constricting and actually mike
mal and i and some other people have
been looking more into this like prop
the problems that can run into low fats
and admittedly
they are very niche and odd it's very
it's very hard to find yourself in like
a fatty acid deficiency situation and um
it's come up in just internally with rp
a couple times we've looked into it so
most people don't have to worry about
that kind of stuff unless you're
deliberately constricting like all of
your fats to like nothing
yeah
boom
all right next up well i don't know
who's next up actually i have to look
but uh yeah
if it's actually uh right below which is
 let's just them up this
one's pretty 62.
yeah this one's getting my man in front
of you
so don asks uh hi
all right
uh i hope you did you mean docs
so i had a stroke
yikes yeah how do i go back to being as
jacked as possible i'm of course not
asking how to recover from a stroke
anything i do will be clear by the
doctor i'm asking purely from the
perspective of the training i know you
just answered a question about going
back to dramatically off but i'm going
to pose some different questions if i
may in case anyone is wondering i have
not been a total dick to my body i don't
smoke or drink i lift weights i do
cardio around i'm a fairly muscular and
lean but i got quote unquote the flu a
few doctors told me that it was
perfectly normal to have splitting
headaches and runny left nostril for
four or five and six weeks she's right
what
job doctors well it is not lol turns out
i have been developing an acid sinus
infection
that got into my brain and clogged a
major vein a rare type of stroke which
sent me to the icu for 20 days on my
back hooked up on machines to monitor
what it seemed like anything happening
to my body
anyway i'm alive and pretty much fine
god damn that's a hell of a recovery
 and the stroke was like
nah fam i'm just going to chill for 20
days
i'm currently under 40 days house arrest
i am mostly resting but i am allowed to
use the treadmill for walking the stage
of your bike and some light exercises
bands etc after that i would be allowed
to start lifting low volume and
intensity was what you had already
confirmed in the last q a but should i
also start lightweight meaning high reps
uh uh okay yeah we'll get to that in a
second again i'm fine nothing prevents
me from uh doing the five to ten rep
range the other thing is lying for 20
days does wonders that you don't want
for your body i lost a ton of muscle and
put on some fat
um am i now primed for a more aggressive
mass or should be business as usual
there are a million anecdotes and some
actual research papers about the ease of
getting back muscle
mass you've lost but i never uh had to
experience it myself well you're
actually for a treat uh consider the
stroke the shady part and this next part
the good part what do you think uh also
should i strive to gain all the muscle i
have lost before mini cutting
in other words is there a window of this
muscle mass rebound that i should take
advantage of without losing some time
and caloric deficit so
best advice comment up james will filter
anything i get wrong or miss here we go
should you lift in the 5 to 10 rep range
no because your tendons and ligaments
and joints are not used to weights that
heavy when you're going to get stronger
really fast so i would say the
20 to 30 range is your best bet for the
next month or two and maybe down if
you're feeling pretty good in the 15 to
20 range yes that will blow but it'll be
easy on your joints and your muscles get
real big and strong
and your joints will start to get
stronger but remember they take longer
to get their strength back great way to
get hurt is start doing sets of five to
ten yeah super strong rapidly and then
pull your pec off the bone people do
that all the time so i would say
start with higher reps exactly what we
said to that uh individual uh in the
other um a q a and actually there's uh
we've got tons of uh actual content like
premade videos about how to come back
from uh training and
tons more coming on that so so that that
will be formal thing but uh more or less
follow that protocol of very very easy
training mostly high reps slowly over
time weeks and weeks and months start to
load weight on the bar as we feel the
case slowly it should be i would say
four to six months before you get back
into the five to ten rep range again
slowly instead of moving down um
now as far as diet eat well
eat the hunger eat healthy
and eat uh you know like sort of
bodybuilding-esque but have some treats
here and there and eat to hunger and as
you train you're going to notice your
hunger is going to go crazy like
it's going to go up substantially and
then just fuel it and you're going to
gain back a shitload of muscle you're
probably going to lose fat as you gain
the muscle back and then at some point
five to six months later you'll find
yourself damn close to where you left
off maybe not right there but pretty
close and then you take a look at your
body you're training pretty normally at
that point you feel great then you can
say okay do i want to do a little mini
cut to prep for more massing do i want
to do a longer cut to get leaner and
then it's kind of launched to do
whatever you want but i would say no
intentional gaining like in the sense of
don't stuff yourself uh and definitely
no intentional fat loss phases for the
next six months for sure just eat and be
happy and if you want to eat more eat
more and you're gonna get really really
muscular really really fast you're
probably going to lose fat or maintain
your fat levels while you do it lots of
fun coming up ahead for you but take it
slow take it easy and make sure to stay
in contact uh constant contact with your
good doctors not the idiots that
you have a sinus infection for six weeks
um
and
hopefully you'll be okay we're glad i'm
glad to hear that you're not uh
not a super up long-term or some
 like that
yeah no kidding and then just to be like
really clear on something so there are
actually exercise physiologists who are
called clinical exercise physiologists
who deal with this kind of stuff
specifically i know you might be
thinking like well you guys are
physiologists yeah we are but we're
sport physiologists there's literally
like a whole field dedicated to
this exact type of problem where you
have like a cardiovascular
contraindication to exercise and those
people know how to deal with this
specifically so i would say of course
stay in good contact with your doctor
see if you can if they have like a
clinical ex fizz person on staff that
you can work with and get some
recommendations from because that would
be really important um now the good news
for you is that it sounds like your
stroke was like unrelated to like at a
cardiovascular event it sounds like it
was just a series of unfortunate events
from a sinus infection so it wasn't like
you had like a like an embolism that was
ready to go and just popped and then you
had stroked out um so that's good it
sounds like like you don't really have a
lot of contraindications so that being
said it
seems likely that you'll be able to
start exercise relatively soon i totally
agree with what dr mike said i don't
think you should try to cut or mask just
kind of it's really not a truly a
maintenance diet but just kind of eat
what you want in a relatively healthy
way plenty of like bodybuilding rp style
meals but don't necessarily seek out to
like be in a surplus or a deficit i
would just kind of allow yourself to
recomp for a little while doing those
higher repetitions and keeping the sets
relatively low the thing is like you're
going to recomp so fast it's
going to be stupid
so trying to really plan anything like
diet or training wise rigidly is just a
waste of time i would just take it slow
know that it's you are going to be
recomping the whole time the first
couple months are going to feel just
like painfully slow like i got to do
sets of like 30 body weight squats this
sucks but
for all the reasons that dr mike already
outlined that's what's going to keep you
safe and keep your ego in check um so
that you don't have you know an injury
later on
on a very similar note
my wife found out that she just doesn't
have an acl and there's lots of
different acl options out there
and one of them is from a cadaver and
it's really interesting that they
usually don't offer the cadaver to
people who are like in their teens and
20s
because the recovery is really fast on
the cadaver which just makes them injure
themselves over again because they get
cocky and overconfident so they don't
give it to young people because of that
that problem
so you see this kind of in a variety of
contexts and so you know my wife is uh
much older than that and uh they offered
it to her knowing that she's
conscientious enough not to injure
reinjure herself even though she feels
good so that's kind of the same idea
that you're you're obviously smart you
follow our channel you ha you ask really
great questions you'll be conscientious
enough to know that like yes what you're
doing now is kind of lame comparatively
to you know more normal kind of lifting
but you know it's going to pay out in
the long term so just kind of put off
that short-term gain and accept that
long-term strategy and i think you'll do
just fine
yeah
lastly something you can focus on over
the last several or the next few months
is really enhancing your technique and
mind muscle connection since you can't
 train heavy anyway definitely
that's a great time to do that so when
you come back to your heavy training
your technique and my muscle connection
will be so much better you're going to
get more out of it you'll be jacked more
jacked than ever
for sure
next up ali
hey that looks like the algorithm not
half bad today at least so far not bad
not bad it up later don't you
worry oh
and you two find some other folks that
were uploaded highly
all right got ali i like that video out
to the right it says what does good
genetics mean and it's just like jared
father the answer is jared father it's
him it's him enough said
all right
ali
sorry i just saw the other one glute and
hamstring
destruction yeah you know uh scott the
video guy names the uh
i tell him what the video is
like i give him some
just general guiding thoughts about what
he knows of the video is he filmed it
and then uh he gets pretty creative with
the naming i'll i'll be straight up with
you guys we named the videos exclusively
for clickbait purposes
because know we offer
really good info but just
don't click on the if you make it
boring so guess what it's it's wacky
names all day like good news is if you
click on it you're like this is going to
be dumb you're like oh wow this is
actually smart
here's a completely reasonable like
gluten hamstring workout like zero
clicks destruction
we're already it's already 22 000 so
it's doing its job your glutes versus
godzilla
all right
thanks docs for the great information
knowledge geek provided community i have
a question regarding the progression
process from one week to the next to
reduce rar by one not remember the rir
reduction is something that happens sort
of on purpose but sort of automatically
so let's just keep that in mind while we
go through your progression
model explains that when a person
increases weight slash reps the rir
would drop independently from each set
of that exercise it should be treated
independently but may not drop in a
million times
however i noticed that for me rir seems
drop seems to carry over from each set
and affects all following sets for
example if in week one i do 10 9 8 reps
and
three three rar in the next week i use
the same weight but increase the reps to
ten to eleven ten nine the rer i
actually get us two one zero instead of
two two two alternatively if i go for
ten nine eight reps
i get
two two two rar is this expected yes
if not where should i start looking to
crack my implementation no it's totally
expected yeah remember when we said a
progression what did you say there uh
the rar would drop independently for
each set of that exercise well that's
actually what you're describing um you
know you you can't assume that adding
one rep to everything is going to change
the r for every set by exactly the same
number earlier sets cause more fatigue
and as you get close to failure
earlier sets really cause more fatigue
and then you can do that
instead of doing 109.8 you're doing 12 6
4 or some like that when you're
really up because that 12 pip
everything out of you
so there's you just treat every set as
if it's its own
when every time
you you plan to increase a rep that's
your best guess at it hitting the right
rar but if you've learned over time that
as you get closer to failure the other
sets drop off more
don't be as ambitious with plans so
something i do for example is towards
the end of my mesocycle if i squatted
for 12 8 7 and then i have to do my
final one i might go 13
8 7 because i know after 13 i'm just
getting eight and barely getting seven
or it'll be a thirteen nine seven
instead of everything goes up i want so
now you have a little bit more wisdom uh
but to be honest this all takes care of
itself in the end because it all washes
out and if you really are proud of
performance you'll know and then it's
time to uh deal and repeat
yeah absolutely and so what you don't
want to do is is where you actually are
getting into the variable rir situation
the like two one zero in the example
that you gave because that's just ego
lifting at that point because you're
chasing those rep numbers you're not
actually assessing the relative
intensity correctly and that's when you
start getting weird like fatigue
overreaching type issues uh later on so
get out of that that mindset of like
okay if i have to beat each set by one
because then you're just chasing those
reps for its own sake just make sure
you're always evaluating those as dr
mike said as like an independent factor
and that'll kind of help and if your
reps drop off like it's totally fine and
again we say this a lot but it's a good
good to remind like as long as you're
within about five and 30 reps i mean
we're doing productive hypertrophy
training if your reps drop off a little
bit now if your drops drop off a little
bit it's not a big deal now if you did
like if you did like uh you know 109.8
in the first week and then you did you
know
like seven four two that's an entirely
different problem that's like you're
overreaching that's when we would say
whoa whoa whoa that's no good right but
if it's like as long as the reps are
pretty comparable and within five to
thirty like you're good to go
upset we're really worried about and if
nothing starts to go down then you're
probably deep in the ship
exactly
all right next up is john phillips sf
right below we're still on track don't
worry this goes to us all right
doctors do you have any recommendations
for specific accessory exercises if one
squat seems limited by low back strength
fatigue should i stick with pt style
exercises like bird dog side planks
those don't do anything as far as i'm
concerned unless you're hurt um what
would you recommend bigger strength
movements like i don't know reverse
hypers i have a history of periodic
lumbar injuries that take me out of
squats entirely for one or two weeks at
a time seems to happen once every 12 to
18 months i seem fine in the 15 to 20
range but below that my back seems to
creep his limiting factor my best advice
is deadlifts
deadlifts are going to be the thing that
makes your back strongest in this world
but if you can deadlift enough your
lower back won't be limiting on squats
that's probably my best uh
best advice james anything else you know
i'm kind of curious if if it's clear
that
if it's clear that strength is the
is the the limiting factor and that's
what's resulting in injury i think
strength might be an issue
but to me that would be more indicative
of like when you start lifting heavier
maybe your technique is breaking down
that's like a classic classic
resistance training problem that
everybody goes through like the heavier
weights it's harder to maintain your
good technique i would be i'm not uh
john phillip i'm not criticizing you
here i'm just thinking out loud but i'd
be very curious to know if if the
strength
is the problem or if it's something else
especially if it's like a consistent
injury if it's happening almost
predictably every 12 to 18 months to me
that sounds like
the first thing that i would look at is
like the technique under the different
loads so that would be my skeptical
eyebrow james would be like let me see
what you're doing um
two you might just find that like some
movements are just shitty for you i know
like for me if i do front squats i'll
get an si flare up i'm actually dealing
with one right now not from front squats
but from shitty sleep but if i do like
front squats my si is going to flare up
it's just going to happen so i just
don't do them um you might have a
similar thing going on maybe the squat
variation or whatever it is that you're
doing it's just a bad matchup for you if
it's if it's happening that regularly i
can't imagine that it's actually like a
lack of strength that's resulting in the
injury it's usually like okay maybe
you're not strong enough to
maintain your technique in the five to
ten rep range and then at that point
it's like either just do more squats or
like mike said you can do like deadlifts
but it's not like uh there's not like an
extra thing you can tack on that's gonna
make that problem go away
that's kind of the problem that you run
into there it's like is it really
strength is it technique or is it just a
shitty movement what do you think about
that dr mike yeah it's unclear unclear
um
i will say if we take john at his best
assessment then getting strong back is
really great uh certainly never hurts
right like yeah it's really easy
deadlift more stuff like a deadlift more
good morning more bird dogs and side
planks are essentially impossible to
overload progressively i actually have
no idea why the people do them uh
it's it's good the interesting warm up
would get you aware of the lower back uh
maybe some injury rehab purposes but
remember these these are the things that
come from kiki
the
stuff and they don't you know pps
don't claim to be able to know how to
get you strong
um yeah oh be wary of those doing much
of anything and john two what you could
also consider doing is um
squat variations that inherently
cause you to use lighter loads and kind
of compare and contrast so like for
example you could do extra heel elevated
um paused close stance squats
and see what happens there because if
it's a truly
that will kind of help eliminate if it's
a load versus a mechanical issue because
the low that you use on that compared to
just doing a normal high bar squat
without a pause will be like a fraction
it'll be like 60 of your working weight
on on that that would be like an
interesting comparison you could do
using variations which are inherently
lighter and that will really um kind of
illustrate if it's like a weakness or a
technique issue
james i see that uh link right there
rhino calf plays with zookeeper oh look
at he's bouncing three years later rhino
team plays with zookeeper one week later
zookeeper position open
oh my god
who wanted to be gentle with you at that
age he would just kill you by
playing with you it's like a 900 pound
cat dude
speaking of deadly animals our friend
alex was in town visiting he was here
for like three days
he saw two bears in three days i've seen
zero i feel ripped off
he like we were hanging out here there
was one in my backyard and then we went
up to a lake and we were driving and a
baby bear just like popped out on the
road and was just like bumbling around i
was like ow you made the most out of
this trip this was great some people got
to see two deadly animals some people
just walk in the light
it's true all right next up is strong
bad oh i love the home star reference
very nice
you know what kind of lame ass anime
 are talking about but it's
not even anime it was like a it was like
before
god it was like a 2000s era like like
like a little like you remember um
like ebon's world
when that was popular it was kind of
like on the same timeline and it was
like these little like web comics kind
of videos of these like certain
characters yeah it was like it was like
a com webcomic kind of thing i guess
yeah
all right strongman says hey docs
how do my wraps drop sets and other
intensity techniques work when you were
doing rp progression schemes would you
only do them in the rp 9 to 10 weeks
seems like a waste if you have three
wraps left in the tank only to pause
your reps or drop the weight
well it's not because if you do let's
say my reps
and you want more of your apps to be
closer to the you know five to zero last
respective reps if you do rar3 for maya
reps you're doing a huge fraction of
your reps in that set between
five and three reps away from failure
which is better than doing
just normal sets in
my rep scheme and just being like okay
i'm just most of these reps are 10 11
and 12 reps from failure so all of the
intensity techniques work just the same
way
if you do progression schemes for reps
and reserve or or even for rpe
uh they're just not super crazy intense
good news in week one you don't need
them to be super crazy intense
so i would say that you they work
totally fine in in every intensity range
yeah absolutely and then you also kind
of have a
like a training logistical issue of of
moving things in like halfway through a
mesocycle which mike and i generally are
not a fan of unless it's like totally
necessary
because then it's going to be very
difficult to track your progress and
then there's going to be fatigue
spillover on other sessions and other
muscle groups and it really just becomes
like a hot mess so it's perfectly fine
to include those right from the get-go
even if the first week is maybe not the
most intense crazy training you will
still adapt to it a little bit which
means in the latter weeks of that
mesocycle you'll be a little bit more
ready to do actual hard training on that
which is a good thing versus like if
you'll say only include in the last two
weeks you don't even know how to dose it
yet because you could be like all right
you gotta go hard you do five sets and
your arms fall off or you do
five sets and that much happens well you
would have known how to dose it had you
been practicing it in the first few
weeks when it didn't really matter
because everything was growing
exactly
next up is jason predict ah yep see
see i was looking for say no to drug
kids but okay got it all right
he says
hi docs how would you go about assessing
performance on the first set of an
exercise would you recommend when i feel
like my second set is just as good i am
warming up thoroughly but it seems like
the first step for most muscle groups is
like a wake up
set that my body isn't ready for so i
can usually match or even slightly
better my performance in the second set
thanks so i would just use the average
of both sets that's probably my best bet
so just add the two reps together add
the two uh reps together from the other
uh you know week and see which one adds
up to more i would say that's probably
the best bet
yeah and so jason just
food for thought this is going to be me
of course sounding like a but
if your second set is better than your
first set typically that means you
didn't warm up sufficiently even if you
felt like you did a pretty okay job so
um what i would say is maybe think about
using something like mike and i are have
always been big fans of the
post activation potentiation style
warm-up where maybe you take like a
single
uh as your last warm-up set at the
target weight maybe even a little bit
heavier depending on what you're doing
and that really kind of helps you get
through that initial wake-up period
and if you want some more information on
that i'm sure mike has done at least
two videos on that and i've done one on
my if you go to like the james strength
conditioning series i have one that's
called session design and i talk about
that a little bit more but yeah
you'd be hard-pressed to make a really
good case where to me where it's like
okay my second set was better than my
first like yeah that means your first
set was still a warm-up set then
by definition not warmed up and that
might mean that your first set sorry
your warm-up set your last warm-up might
like let's say you're going for a set of
12 ideally in your first working set
your last warm-up might need to be the
working weight for a set of five
right that's what gets you going that's
what gets you going good news is it a
little bit hypertrophic yeah take the
bonus hypertrophy
yeah for sure and it's something that's
just like a little trial and error you
might find that like some movements you
maybe just take a single others you
might uh you might only um take like a
more if let's say you were working up to
like maybe
275 pounds for some squats you might
find that yeah you do your last warm-up
set at 225 and you're good to go other
people might actually need to take a cup
like one or two at 275 some people might
have their yeah or exactly or go up even
heavier and that now it actually feels
light and ready to go so each exercise
and movement might be a little bit
different for and it's just fun to play
around with i know for me i usually have
for my leg training i gotta take a heavy
one to feel really good um for my upper
body training like i can kind of hop in
usually not a huge deal either way
all right next up is vasil
west you'll remember
hey doc's quad squat
question i've been high bar squatting
for about a year now doctor mike style
but i have more of a dr james skeletal
structure no
between my deadlifts and squat 10rm that
doesn't that's not by the way a big deal
but yeah it also doesn't imply anything
um
just extending arm length
it like
explains that entire thing technically i
do slow
slow eccentrics hypertrophy deadlifts my
legs
don't look bad slash weak but they're
also not the limiting factor in my squat
neither is cardio i have a mid to top
range sticking point and i don't know
wth is happening with the movement if my
quads look alright my deadlift is super
strong compared to my squat and my
cardio is not limiting me then what
gives
uh the quads simply do not feel like
limiting factor to p.s i'm incorporating
squatting again
because unfortunately dutch gyms are
equipped with to the gills with techno
gym equipment oh no
oh this is such a bad post i feel like
you do you live in hell you have my
anthropometry and you have to use techno
gym equipment
and their leg press is atrocious
um yeah that stinks uh what i would say
is you don't need the squat to be super
crazy limiting to get good
growth in the quads you can also do
things like bulgarian split squats and
um narrow stance walking lunges to get
really good extra quad hypertrophy
without any lower back limitations so
there are some other exercises you can
do in addition you can at least
try to rig with a cable um
some belt squats that's always a thing
that you can do
or with a dip belt and some stands so
give that a shot but other than that i
mean look if your back isn't weak
uh
then
maybe just that's how you fail you gotta
fail at some point and maybe yeah if
your your torso really is small
it makes sense that your your deadlift
is big but that might not be because you
have a very strong back it could just be
because you're super leveraged or
deadlift and not to squat i'll tell you
the weight you're describing is just the
squat
you would have to be able to deadlift
something like a thousand for the squat
to be a limiting factor for you because
the leverage differences are so extreme
and that might mean that you just need
to do some other exercises and and put
squatting later in your
sessions so that the quads are more
limiting factor and uh you know i've
been to the netherlands a whole bunch
you can go out of your way once a week
to find a pretty decent gym you just
have to do a little bit of research as
to where the best gyms are
most of the time you can make it happen
talk to your gym or tell them to get a
machine that's not stupid but uh
james do you have any other suggestions
for um
quad training that doesn't just involve
high martha flaunting yeah yes your
answer was really good um so one of the
problems that you run into when you're
tall and lanky kind of like us vasil is
that as you mentioned quads sometimes
are not the limiting factor and that's
just simply a mechanical thing where you
really just can't do as much continuous
throughput just because of the way that
your torso and hip are moving as a
result of being lanky that's just how
you're built and there's really not much
you can do and as mike said you can
still get some pretty good quad out of
it it's just maybe not the same as some
other people who feel it really like all
the way through the entire range of
motion like a doctor mike for example
he's built like for squatting it's great
um so what i recommend is exploring
pre-fatigue options and some more quad
dominant variations i feel bad saying
the same exercise twice in the same q a
here but one thing that i like to do
that i've had a lot of success with and
you can you can do any combinations of
these types of things but for me i'll do
um paused squats for sets of like
you know between 5 and 15 ish reps so
you know it's it's kind of stupid to do
those
heavy so i usually like to start high
like 15 and kind of work down um and
then i'll do for me like a close stance
or like a heel extra heel elevated close
stance paw squat
where the weight is not terribly heavy
compared to what i could do and at that
point after the squats like i can
really feel like the only thing that's
stopping me at this point is the quads
if you're built like you know if you're
long and lanky typically you probably
have a strong torso and decent glutes
and so it's very easy for you to just
rely on kind of oofing the weight up
so i would look at maybe looking at some
pre-fatigue options usually
for long legs like knee extension is a
good pre-fatigue option usually leg
press and hack squat you can you can
find
decent ones but i know you're working
with techno gym so maybe that's not
a good choice but look into like doing
some pre-fatigue with squats or
knee extensions or um like knees knees
forward squats any any combination
of those things will probably be helpful
for you
next up is j
space r
jr tolkien
[Music]
have you ever had a client make better
progress on less than two times a week
frequency example someone's hitting
everything twice a week and they're not
progressing and recovering you use the
same volume and reduce frequency
to every fourth or fifth day or even
once per week and they start making
progress basically same overall weekly
volume just reduced frequency i'm the
type of person who can do hamstring
curls for one set of
for one set or five sets in one session
and it still takes me roughly five days
to recover
that's with progressing rir rp style i
personally seem to have
better in session recovery than between
session recovery i'm 42 by the way i do
upper lower twice a week but i
definitely feel better on an upper lower
upper one week and the next week lower
upper lower i have good sleep low stress
sitting job five to eight k steps a day
and do the low stimulus to fatigue
exercises
uh hopefully highest stimulus to fatigue
exercise i possibly can
thoughts examples like i just do rack
deadlifts with no straps
uh thoughts examples thanks in advance
you legends thank you so much yeah i've
actually um
so the the answer to this question is
yes but only with a few lifts like
deadlifts
for most people the answer is no the um
twice a week works much better let's say
this if you've tried it a couple times
and you really isolated all the
variables and you go back and forth back
and forth
then i think you need to go and do what
works best
you know that's your truth as they say
yeah absolutely i i same with mike here
i haven't really had anyone except for
people who were like really
strong and it was like on a kind of like
a main lift like a bench squat or a
deadlift usually deadlift i have had
people with that problem with benching
but they were like big big benchers
um so yeah you might actually find that
like an asymmetrical kind of schedule
might work better for you in this case
where you are not necessarily sticking
to like a seven day week plan but maybe
like an eight day or nine day plan more
or less just to a lot for those recovery
timelines and if that works for you
that's great it's gonna be more of a
pain in the ass to manage
but at the same time there's nothing
wrong with it
next up
to quote the devil in south park is
krieth
chris
hey korean did you did you see uh south
park well i guess the uh
the trey parker and matt stone were in
the the news because they bought casa
bonita in denver
no way yeah apparently that was
i don't know if it was they were hurting
kazukovit or they just wanted to sell it
but for whatever reason they they got it
they got it
that set me back a little bit i was like
oh i remember that episode yeah
apparently it's a real place
from the real world i didn't know that
was a real place i thought it was just
some that they made up
yeah i thought that was funny
all right
chris says hey docs what hip hinge
exercises would you recommend for
athletes with lower back pain lumber
region that's all the lrdl and good
mornings fry my lower back way before my
hamstrings and glutes start to get
stimulated so what i would say
is there are precious few exercises that
allow you to hip hinge without involving
lower back because you think of it from
a physics perspective if you hinge like
this here's your hip here's your back if
you load something out here it taxes
your back a lot but it also makes a
really gnarly lever arm if you load
something here it might not attack your
lower back but you have to lift like
9000 kilos for it
so um my best answer is actually fry the
 out of your hamstrings with some
leg curls of various kinds yes then put
on a nice solid belt really get
your technique going step some supports
down
make sure you're always super hyper
extending your back for that massive
arch tilting those hips anterior like
 crazy and then slow eccentric
your way into some very light good
mornings or um stiff legged deadlifts
and then you you got a hamstring growing
solution right there james
yeah that's an excellent suggestion um
maybe i'm reading too deeply into this
but he's asking uh
what exercises would you recommend for
athletes
and so to me that that begs no no i
think you were totally on point with
what you said but i'm also wondering
you could make a case that um
your athletes don't necessarily have to
do
hip hinges you could also
get by with all sorts of other training
movements it certainly is a good one for
your hamstrings and for your hips uh but
if it's a consistent problem you could
also make a case to say that you could
you could work around just not doing it
that would be totally fine yeah for
athletes that need like speed and
mobility and stuff i would say that uh
45 degree back raises 45 degrees
backwards nordic curls they tend to have
some opinion component and they work
pretty well but none of those are what
you'd really call like a
hardcore hip hinge and like james said
maybe hardcore hip hinging isn't really
you know like do soccer players need
like lower backs of steel probably not
yeah and you're going to get a lot of
that just through like you're running
sprinting jumping type activities too so
it's kind of like it's an easy work
around if it's for athletes but i think
if you're talking about like hypertrophy
training then go back to dr mike's first
answer with the pre-fatigue is a very
good strategy and like you can do that
same thing with like a 45 degree back
raise too and just kind of take it take
it slow and light and figure out like
what loads you can
work with and what tempos and mind
muscle connection and that might be a
kind of a good build up to something
like a good morning or something later
on
once once once you've had months
months mezzos of pain free training
doing that hip hinging movement right
that's the key it's like okay you've
you've gotten into a groove with
something like maybe a 45 degree
and no pain no pain you've increased the
load no pain you've been going for a
while okay maybe we entertain doing some
pre-fatigued good mornings and see how
that goes right pain-free though
last on our docket is jeremy bata
germany got it
there can only be one
all right
jeremy's question is interesting
[Music]
is there a place in the rp training
system slash methods for the heavier
hardcore training style of many pros
such as during yates attribute
their graininess too
[Music]
um
yeah
so
uh i'll put this in a very charitable
very critical thinking scientific sort
of light
there is no evidence whatsoever
that training at a certain loading range
changes the outside visible appearance
of your muscles short of hypertrophying
them
or making them smaller
secondly
there is no current known anatomical
physiological mechanism
or remote rationale for that idea
third
graininess is seems to be a quality that
only white people can attain
asians don't seem to get grainy and
black people don't seem to get grainy
but asians and black people get as lean
as or leaner than white people
consistently so i honestly think it's
just like a skin quality look sort of
thing
and i think it has my best hypothesis
we'll see what green says is this is
probably a 99.9 chance that has nothing
to do with how heavy you train
um and uh everything to do with how lean
you get and how dry you get and just
your own genetic look for some people is
for example graininess is actually not a
desired look by many people who are
trying to
um lift
and get lean to like you know get laid
in the ship like you know
girls honestly it looks freaky yeah
right girls on a yacht want you to have
nice smooth looking tan skin
and if you're ripped they're like oh
that's cool that if you're grainy
they're like what the happened to
you now all the guys in the yacht are
currently asking you how many push-ups
you can do and whether or not you think
prt is a good idea uh
uh yes that's how lifting works folks
nobody getting laid out here
so in any case um you know grain
innocence is probably just an individual
thing and it has more to do with um
genetics more do how lean you are and
probably something to do with drugs um
at least a little bit and almost nothing
if nothing at all to do with uh training
um
uh
weight as far you know so tons of power
lifters have been as strong or stronger
than during yeats transitioned to
bodybuilding and don't look grainy um
so there's tons of lines of evidence and
zero of them except dorian yates said he
thinks it makes him look grainy oh
here's another one um branch warren
and uh dennis wolfe both at various
points in uh uh in their prep
specifically before they put on tanner
looked grainy and they uh you know now
it's cold never trained all that heavy
bright worn sort of heavy but nothing
like none they write home about uh does
plenty of higher upsets too so
it's just one of those things where you
know if you're if your
your data point is during the eighths
and during the eight said
uh
it's not that powerful of a data point i
wouldn't hang my hat on it
yeah i totally agree with you here it's
i would say it's mostly a product of
just being muscular and then how lean
you get on top of that um i can't
there's no there's no rationale for any
type of training that would elicit that
i mean you might
you might
make a case and this is a very weak case
for like having just like a being very
pumped up might enhance that look
so like just you know like having like a
high pump might be better from like
higher reps or maybe moderate reps than
like super super heavy so that would be
in the other direction but i think
that's weak also i think it's just more
of a fact of are you buff are you lean
and if you're you might be buff but not
lean and you won't look grainy you know
it's one of those so it's i can't think
of any um any practical implications
outside of like being a white man who's
buff and lean
and that's like
not a whole lot you can do if that's not
your situation so
yeah
i wish i was grainy i look like
grain train
oh the perfect example uh super rip
super unfortunate john meadows i was
thinking the same thing i didn't time i
didn't know if i wanted to bring it up
it's been it's been a decade and a half
since he trained heavy how the did
that happen you know like if there's at
least one counter example you got to
start wondering if there's at least if
there's only one example and one counter
example that is at best as a 50 50
chance graininess as dick to do with how
heavy you trade because it has no uh
rationale because there's not even a
mechanism proposed like here's here's
another problem what the is
graininess has never ever bothered to
define rhaenys such that
a group of bodybuilding enthusiasts can
even go through 100 photos and agree on
who the grainiest people were and then
has it ever been defined such that okay
now that we know those people we call
them into laboratory we examine the skin
of other equally lean people and then we
try to look for like you know it's like
a dermatologist can explain to you why
your skin looks a certain way like well
you have these little veins everywhere
or little pock marks what is it what is
actual greatness most people just have
never even bothered to think about what
it is so i don't even know what we're
shooting for you know what i mean like
all that stuff jorian looked a cool way
the way that dorian looked and there's
why not dick you can do about it uh
short of getting his genetics training
super hard um and getting super
lean and then maybe you got it maybe you
don't maybe just look super cool and
lean and slick and maybe you look rainy
and it's probably not up to you do you
know who's not very grainy
brazilian slash indian synthol man
brazilian synthol man formerly known as
indian synthol man
no grain there amongst insects just
perfectly round and smooth
so there was a gentleman james can you
do can you can you share a screen and
google
so
we don't just sound like castles yeah so
he looked indian to us so we named him
indian sentinel man and so did a lot of
other people but it turns out should i
try a brazilian just or just go to
google not not not youtube okay if
there's a video great but yeah brazilian
synthol synthetic man brazil
uh
you'll he'll come up there's no way
we're dodging him oh
my man there he is
god he's so awesome oh my god he's all
in all right
like that you think this looks good what
do you think that looks good what's
wrong with you
you have like gigantor tits those are
 megas
in fear as a mortal of a true ascended
scene oh my gosh
it's like do you think that looks good
that's look at it look at from the
profile oh my god i gotta move my face
what on earth are you doing that like
that wouldn't even look hot if they were
tits yes james click on get that out of
here down until the left man injected
himself with
is he russian he has to be russian
uh nope he's in brazil
oh also he's also
dude it's a thing in brazil it's a thing
um there's there's
okay another search russian synthol kid
he's actually a lifetime hero nothing
i'll ever do
where where is he this guy yes he's the
 man okay so the best thing about
him i don't think he's even bothered to
try this is so expected
oh my god what is wrong with you yeah
there's one where he
is um
yeah in one of those
and he gets oh and then another one
where he so he's in the slap fight one
and he's also in an mma one i got the
mma when people looked
up oh my god what is wrong with you what
are you rushing
is the man your is so
infected
yeah he ended up not doing so well with
that whole bit oh look at this yikes
look at me i'm a russian simple kid
folks this is what happens when you your
arms get infected from all the synthol
and then you have to get surgery
afterwards oh man this is we're
going down a rabbit hole very quickly
here we're going i'm going to the odds
his name is
if you're rushing you'll get that one
um in any case
let's see what we learned today do
something all do a lot of it and go get
ridiculous because then you'll have
friends family that's right you'll grow
a family uh wealth riches you'll finally
bang girls on yachts and people will
stop asking you for how to get jacked
because you're not jacked you're full of
and you won't have that grainy look
sorry sorry that's the only thing you
don't get
but you'll have blazambas
apparently like uh you ask like an evil
genie for for muscles and he's like i
give you everything you accept grain
you're like great he gives you in
the ensemble guy and you're like
you literally have like a like
uh like a a melons worth of synthol just
sitting there it's like a breast implant
i honestly hate feeling how jacked i am
because like it interferes like rolling
over bad socks like i can't even
honestly you guys will get a kick out of
this at this point when i do pull downs
and i do a full rom my traps and upper
packs literally blood choke me to the
point where i'm here i like start kind
of losing a little conscious like oh my
god finally
it's terrible this guy is suffering all
the same and worse but for no
strength or respect
i mean
what he has i take that back yeah i was
gonna say gets a little respect right
just from how he's just so committed to
that synthol life
can you james if you sat next to him on
a plane like a like a flight to london
seven hours would you say anything at
any point
you get your giants in the arm
the off my rats i'd be like
[Laughter]
no he speaks english just not so great
i'd be like you're you're that synthol
guy aren't you buddy just sorry yes you
know me
like i'd be like are you sponsored by
castrol or some like how much do
you go through per month
he's got like that's synthetic that's
her jacket they're like yep that's our
 nw30 is it a blend what is what are
you putting in there
okay okay last joke last joke you're
like in the middle of utah and there's
no stations around
and and like you stay on full tank of
gas but like the car oil light goes on
and it's like it's advanced that says
like oil now where the car stops the car
stops everyone looks at him like hey
guys dude guess what like no no no not
out here like open up it's happening
open uh
we got a razor blade we got some gauze
this has to happen that actually
happened partially to mel and i we were
driving her truck and it was like oil
now or death and we were like
where is it where is russia
oh god damn it you had one job synthetic
mike and i envisioned this scenario
all right well on that rabbit hole i
think we're going to wrap this one up
folks thank you for the upvotes we
actually had a ton of upvotes which is
really helpful for us in sorting which
questions are most interesting thanks
for everyone else for contributing even
if even if we didn't get to you thanks
for contributing nonetheless dr mike any
housekeeping rp stuff
oh uh one guy asked a question about
alcohol and i just cut and pasted my old
facebook post about it because it pretty
much answered all of it you know like
you and i get into some rehashing and at
some point i can't rehashing anymore i
know you can't either so i was like hey
check this out that's like i made a
facebook post like maybe seven years ago
like on the basics of alcohol and
lifting and it was like it's just one of
those posts like it hits all the main
bit points and i just copied and pasted
from the rp account so like i hope
that's a decent answer i don't really
need to just you off but uh you
know at some point i'll make another
video oh i'll make a youtube video about
alcohol lifting i'm currently getting a
million
i can't wait to see the title on that
one
uh yeah i'm not gonna say anything else
i'll tell you something off camera okay
uh i have a bunch of projects that i'm
working on but i don't know if i can
talk about any of them so just always
more rp stuff in the works folks stay
tuned until next time
we'll see ya
