[Music]
that literally doesn't count do one more
good one arms only stop locking your
legs
[Music]
[Laughter]
all right
this is nick coey
he is absurdly jacked he's actually a
men's physique guy which brings the
thought of what the hell is going on
with men's physique yeah he's bigger
than me i'm a super heavy jared is uh
open guy classic now open and it's kind
of weird so he's the man he's gonna be
doing a back workout with us fast jared
feather he's gonna be doing the back
workout i'm dr mike and i'm actually
training today so you know what i'm
saying this is what it's like in the
trenches and shit whatever anyway let's
go do the back workout
i had a whole different plan for my
mezzo sort of jared but we have to
cobble something together here
because we're training dragons and i
don't usually train here pull downs are
going to be first sets of 15 to 20 reps
and then the weight's gonna be lowered
every set probably by me in order to
keep the rep range relatively the same
uh full range of motion all that good
stuff next exercise will be lat players
and then cambered bar rows afterwards
then i do a bunch of other bullshit but
that's back let's get into it
[Music]
it really picks my chest up
instead of getting like
like this looks like you're pushing your
chest up
what you want to do here stretch
chest chest chest just
[Music]
so i'm still
pushing it this way but i'm not leaning
back to push it that way okay so it's
more left okay
it's it's hard as fuck if you've never
done it
so you might have to go pretty light
stretch
stretch all the way all the way
there you go over exaggerate it
all the way there you go
beautiful
oh yeah let's go let's go
[Music]
beautiful big chest big chest big chest
yes
[Music]
good stretch all the way down don't jerk
yes
good
keep going
another one
[Music]
oh yeah bro come on
[Music]
yes sir come on
yes sir come on
show us messy guy i was done
okay
[Music]
come on
adjust to the bottom
chest
keep going
[Applause]
pull straight down from there just
yes exactly
let's go nick yeah
oh swing straight down straight down
there
[Music]
fuck's wrong with his fucking arms
men's physique they say
[Music]
all right pull downs are done
lap prayer time
super emphasis on the stretch full
extension at the top always controlled
gentle touch down to the hips or the
tummy
sets of 10 to 20 reps i'm only gonna do
two sets jared and nick are probably
gonna do four or five because they've
been training polanezo i'm just in week
two
let's do it
[Music]
you want your lats in a disadvantaged
position on purpose
so you're trying to get it all from the
lats so here you should be doing this
you shouldn't be doing this
so from here it's just this and then you
can start to raise up and squeeze
okay
just
stretch stretch stretch set up
one more slow
go
oh yeah
oh yeah beautiful
[Music]
good stuff
yeah
felt really good
your laps are popping out
[Music]
oh
[Music]
there you go jared
yep
oh
come on you got a little more
[Music]
yes
good set man fuck what's that
now my lats are lit
it doesn't take much no it doesn't just
good technique yeah high quality rips
yep that's targeting the muscle not
fucking sweet exactly
[Music]
come on
oh last one you're gonna go right back
down i got you you're good go
go go
ah
glass is so lit
why is he in mid to
and he's bigger than me
what is this bullshit
what the fuck
cambered barrows we like to do these at
a deficit because we're really
masochistic
no swinging of the upper body at all
but don't pause at the top because that
tends to drop the requisite weight so
much bottom stretch is missed out on
gentle touch full stretch gentle touch
no swinging
sets of 10 to 15 reps
uh
back is pre-exhausted lats pretty
exhausted it's gonna be a good exercise
let's do it
beautiful
oh shit
[Music]
[Applause]
so you want your back completely flat
straight back lift your chest higher
like this
yeah just like that
move your knees back a little bit
row your chest oh very good good now
set it up
and row into your tummy and down
and up
and down
and up see how your upper body is moving
stop moving it arms only yes
better
keep your chest up too
arch that back the whole time keep it up
these are very good
good rack that was just a warm up
that feel okay yeah that's what we're
going to be doing yeah
bars is a little weird for me yeah yeah
it's it's an advanced technique complete
rigidity of the brush none of this
none of this
you set up your block
arms
arms
arms it's going to want to make you do
this
insert your chest
we'll do a work site in a sec
stretch

child strength

coming from a guy who never grew up
vertically
[Music]
yeah
no upper body movement
just like that
yep
chest up

arch that back
yeah
three more good ones nick
one stretch slow

last one

tell me you feel it
oh shit there we go
yeah why don't you hit a fucking back
shot to it
good shit
[Music]
oh you guys
back is done
but the way jared and i have our program
split up
saturday so we have back and then a
little bit of shoulders and a little bit
of biceps at the end that gives us the
opportunity to train shoulders and
biceps three times a week instead of two
which is a big deal we need the added
volume up jared doesn't need any more
shoulder volume but there's no such
thing as too big of shoulders
so
i'm gonna do a maya rep set here one
mile rep so as many as i can rest for
three five and then another little
cluster if i do three or four of those
and then on to uh biceps for jared and i
but that'll be off camera we're not
gonna bore you guys with that shit
[Music]
