hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
strength training myths video number
three you shouldn't
deadlift any more than one time per
week let's take a look we're going to
take a look at the claim
the reality of deadlifts and fatigue
some situations in which maybe more
deadlifting can be better
and then asking what the best approach
is after that
so the claim
very common is if you deadlift more than
once a week
hard and heavy you're going to get
crushed the cumulative fatigue
is just going to lead to super poor
performances if not worse
super common in power lifting circles
there's very little disagreement from
this with most power lifters
but is it really true so here's the deal
there is a huge grain of truth to this
deadlifts
more than bench presses and squats in
most cases seem to be uniquely fatiguing
or uniquely higher fatigue than
the equivalent number of sets and reps
and percentages for squats or bench
especially once you're pulling over
about 500 pounds
unless you're a super long-armed freak
and it's just not a big range of motion
for you
you're going to take a huge hit from any
deadlift workout a lot of you folks
watching this who have deadlifted heavy
before
know exactly from experience what i'm
talking about there's a fatigue
deadlifts give you
that's really just unmatched with the
same volume of any other lift i mean it
just totally erases you
and if you try to deadlift heavy too
soon in the week or at all in the week
later
what ends up happening is your
performance just awful and there's like
a weakness
in your lower back area that's difficult
to describe
sometimes it's even like a nervous
system weakness where as soon as you get
your hands around the deadlift bar and
you're not recovered from last session
of heavy deadlifts
you just don't even feel strong it's
really really crazy
so for most people this means that
stuffing in more than one deadlift
session per week is just prohibitive
um and even if it's tough but doable
a lot of times it's just not really
doable it just doesn't work it makes you
weaker over time rather than stronger
now you may ask what about those
exercise science studies
showing that deadlifts aren't especially
fatiguing they have very poor ecological
validity they're conducted usually on
untrained
undergraduates and physical fitness
majors and
they're not conducted over a long period
of time they're usually just one
exposure and then measuring fatigue
with some kind of instrument that
doesn't directly measure actual
week-to-week deadlock performance which
is the ultimate measurement of does this
work or does it not
and it's really tough to just offer up
this one study as a refutation
of something almost every good
powerlifter
has experienced and knows to be true
right it's a real tough sell to tell
people hey deadlifts aren't actually
uniquely fatigued you're like
well you know everyone i know all the
best lifters and myself included
not one of the best lifters just someone
i know
has just gotten crushed by deadlifts
there's got to be something there and
the i'm of a firm belief
there absolutely is and the validity of
the exercise science studies is just
missing it so we don't want to just uh
say okay it's bullshit because this one
study found is true we have way better
evidence in one study
it's almost every power lifter ever
since deadlifts are excessively
fatiguing
they are on average that doesn't mean
that some folks can't benefit from more
than once a week deadlifts
okay it does need to be treated with
respect so you don't want to rush into
any high frequency deadlift programs
you'll also notice there's tons of squat
everyday programs or high frequency
squaring there's tons of high frequency
benching
i have yet to see a high frequency
deadlift program that's probably not by
accident they just
really just don't work right
however there are some groups of people
that can benefit from more
frequent deadlifting first of all are
smaller lifters
especially female lifters who do not
accumulate as much fatigue
and they recover faster from fatigue
that they do accumulate
they in many cases can absolutely do two
hard deadlift sessions per week and that
makes them better
it's not just that they can that two
hard deadlift sessions per week makes
them better
than just one hard deadlift session so
for those folks they recover faster
they should be doing it in addition to
that
almost all lifters perhaps all
can get better at deadlifting by at
least practicing the lift more often
that means maybe they just do one heavy
session per week that's very hard
but maybe a session of a few sets of
three to six reps with an rpe of like
five
so sub maximal later in the week
can help improve technique a lot and
make your device better because think
about it this way
often squat multiple times a week your
technique stays nice and crisp and
actually improves over time
you bench multiple times a week your
technique can get better and then stay
crisp
people who just deadlift physically hard
or heavy
or or light with technique they usually
just deal with once a week
you know if you want to get good motor
pattern movement pattern wise at
something
you really just don't train it once a
week i mean that's almost unheard of in
the movement sciences it's you're better
off training at least twice a week
and if you actually do deadlifting once
hard and once much easier
it absolutely improves your performance
because next time you go in and deadlift
hard especially
weeks and months later your technique on
the hard dials is way better
because you had practice on the easy
ones and they didn't add any fatigue
that could be a very powerful up and
unfortunately many people don't do this
because a lot of lifters have this
mentality of
either i'm in the gym doing lifts hard
or i'm not
right i squat twice a week both are
heavy the first thing is light squats
what the fuck am i doing them for well
it turns out technique's a real thing
olympic weight lifters are used to this
they have some days when they go heavy
some days when they go much lighter
and it's purposefully to improve their
technique because they know they need
more technique training
then they can survive heavy training
it's a fact and the deadlift absolutely
falls into that category
so a sample week that we can construct
for a small female deadlifter for
example
is on monday she could deadlift four
total working sets
three to four reps per set with an rp of
seven to ten good old meat potatoes
working
weights uh working relative efforts on
wednesday
she might deadlift four sets again but
this time five to six reps are actually
less
load more volume similar adaptations
just a bit of daily undulating
periodization there
and then an rp of seven to ten so again
a hard session doesn't require as much
pulling force
but absolutely requires a lot of fatigue
to be spent
friday look if we did another heavy
deadlift session friday by next monday
she'd be toast and be useless however
friday
what she could do is just three sets not
a ton of work
three reps percent again even less work
than before
and an rp of five on each one of those
sets it's literally just working through
the technique
weight is just heavy enough to feel like
a deadlift that the center of gravity is
kind of where it should be
versus if you were doing a completely
unloaded bar or something it would just
be like
wacky technique you could lift it anyway
and you wouldn't even know which way
gravity points because there's not
enough gravity pulling the weight down
rp5 three sets of three reps drops the
fatigue from the other deadlifts
if just not touching it at all letting
it fall on its own and it enhances
technique
so when she goes back to training next
monday to do her heaviest
deadlifts again not only is she going to
have low fatigue because ever since
wednesday she didn't train hard on the
deadlift friday was an easy session
but also that friday gave her a little
bit of a technical boost some refinement
so her setup in the actual deadlift on
monday when it's heavy is going to be a
little bit better
it's going to lead to better results if
you're a large male
right then maybe two hard deadlift
sessions like that
are untenable like monday you do a hard
deadlift session wednesday you're not
doing shit
that requires hard deadlifting because
you're way too fucked up in that case
you can try a lower frequency approach
that is
still a little bit of that element of
technique monday do four sets of three
to six reps
rp of seven to ten hard training
thursday
you might do three sets of three with an
rpe of five
technique only training it doesn't add
to fatigue from the deadlift
it absolutely makes because of that
higher frequency more time for practice
more frequent practice it makes you
better at the physical
movement of deadlifting and then when
you go to next monday
you'll be more crisp more sharp not any
more fatigued
and you lift better and that second
example
is probably better in almost every way
than just
deadlifting heavy once a week and then
doing nothing at all douglas for later
the rest of the week similar stimulus
but on the strength side on the neural
force production side
but not as much technique refinement and
small deviations and technique can
absolutely add up to notable numbers on
the bar
so what's the best approach if you're at
a current dela frequency
start with your current deadlift
frequency and maybe considering upping
that
frequency by one session per week
for the deadlift right so i would say
that wherever you are in deadlifting
frequency
you should probably that session you add
should be a technique only session
okay i wouldn't add a working session
like super hard and heavy deadlifts
once a week is what you're used to i
wouldn't go to super hard and every day
off twice a week that may be too much
just add a technique session you know
rp5 triples or something like that
see how you feel your deadlift might
start going up and it might start
feeling better
now when you're prioritizing the
deadlift in specific
mesocycles designed to prioritize the
deadlift you may actually insert
another hard session during that time so
you may actually do that monday
wednesday friday thing where it's monday
hard and heavy
wednesday a little bit lighter but still
super hard and then friday
very easy recovery technique only work
you may try that
make sure your rep ranges are a little
bit different between the two sessions
monday and wednesday
make sure the heaviest of the two comes
first or in other words is after that
long interval of recovery
so when you're training monday your
heaviest that means last friday was your
lightest
and wednesday was the last hard workout
that's a lot of time for recovery
because that monday
is the most demanding session the most
important the one in which you need to
be the most recovered
lastly you want to reduce your squatting
volume
because deadlift priority cycles a lot
of times deadlifting uses
very many of the similar muscles for
squatting so take your squatting volume
and put it either to maintenance or
minimum effective volume
lower because you want to make room in
your recovery abilities
for more deadlifting and then you see
how that pans out
you may get a third of the way through
the cycle and be like this is stupid
then you just go back to doing one hard
session in one light session
you might actually have great results
but at the end of the mess i could like
um my deadlift has gone up a ton and
then next meso after the d-load you're
like wow it went up even more than i
thought but that definitely beat me up
and it's not sustainable then you can
use it every now and again
uh on a you know on an occasion that you
actually want to increase your deadlift
more than your other lifts folks thanks
for tuning in see you next time
