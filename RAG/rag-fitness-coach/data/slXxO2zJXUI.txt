hey folks dr mike christelle here for
rp plus renaissance periodization rp
university
lecture one in our course in nutrition
for fat loss how to get lean
through nutritional approach lecture one
is
intro and basic principles super
important to make sure we have
everything framed properly
understand the real basics of stuff so
once we get into the details everything
makes sense in context
what are we going to talk about today
we're going to talk about what fat loss
aims to do
the mechanisms of fat loss the reasons
and benefits behind losing fat
some trade-offs and downsides of losing
fats it's actually not all rosy
general nutrition approaches we're going
to talk about the rest of the lecture
typical time courses of how long fat
loss takes because there's a lot of
mythology there about how quickly you
can lose fat or how long it has to take
and then we're going to talk about what
our next lecture is going to look like
so let's get right into it what is the
aim
of fat loss it's really straightforward
it's to reduce the amount of adipose or
fat tissue that you have
right and it this effect is usually
occurred uh or usually happens by making
individual fat cells
smaller fat cell holds this much fat you
reduce it in size it holds less
and then externally you look leaner
because you are leaner
we're not burning fat cells we're not
killing fat cells
we are not turning fat into muscle um
how come that's impossible well it's two
different kinds of organs
you can no more turn fat in a muscle
then you can turn your liver into your
kidneys
it's a good shot if you if you succeed
you have a nobel prize coming your way
here's the thing some people say okay we
can't turn fat into muscle technically
but can't we do recomposition
will we gain muscle lose fat at the same
time lean out but not really change our
body weight or our body size
beginners can do this relatively well
but for more advanced individuals or if
you really want to put your best foot
forward and lose as much fat as you can
recomposition is not something to gamble
on because it's a very inefficient
process
as you get more and more advanced as you
get leaner recomposition
is worse and worse and worse and at some
point just takes an almost infinite
amount of time so it's better to have
dedicated phases
fat loss where we know muscle growth
won't be that great and then dedicated
phases of muscle gain we know
could gain a little bit of extra fat
alternate those that's the best way
forward as opposed to trying to sort of
do everything at the same time
now what is the aim of fat loss outside
of just
uh you know losing the fat it's clearly
for a purpose well there's a couple
purposes
one is that we can focus on performance
outcomes we can get higher jumps we can
run faster if we lose fat
totally works as a matter of fact
endurance hugely improves if that is
reduced
so if you're let's say a grappler or
something like that or a boxer and you
lose 10 pounds of body fat your
endurance is going to go through the
roof
next probably the most obvious ones is
just to be focused on a certain physique
you want a certain look you want to be
leaner period for its own sake
next you can be focused on health blood
work improves when you lose fat
almost every single time as a matter of
fact one of the most
obvious the most simple the most
straightforward and most reliable ways
to improve your health if you're at a
healthy body weight and a normal body
fat
is to get leaner if you're at a higher
body fat it's a
no mystery deal i mean straightforward
losing fat improves almost every fact
about your health
unless you're getting super super lean
or super super skinny which is super
rare right
lastly you could be doing it to focus on
lifestyle change
what does that mean well if you're tired
of like getting into and out of cars you
guys know some of you that have been
heavier i've been much heavier myself
like getting into a car and getting out
of a car is tough when you weigh north
of 250 pounds
and sometimes you're just tired of like
not fitting in airplane seats and just
lumbering around your feet hurt
you're maybe just fine health-wise and
you maybe don't super care about how you
look you look fine you think
but if you lose like 10 15 20 pounds of
fat you could just make your life easier
your sleep better you move around better
things fit better
it can be a super great thing all of
those are valid reasons heck you can
even do a couple of them at the same
time but
just so you know where people are coming
from for fat loss all super valid
right now how does fat loss work as far
as basic mechanisms well
we can just take a sort of biochemical
approach at this the fsr is the
fractional synthetic rate of fat tissue
that's how fast fat is built
and the fractional breakdown rate fbr is
the degree to which fat
is lysed to which it is degraded to
which it is broken down
and it's really quite simple if the rate
of fat building
is higher than the rate of fat breakdown
you're going to incrementally get fatter
over time
if the rate of fat breakdown is higher
than the rate of fat building you are
going to get incrementally leaner over
time
really really straightforward it's
pretty close to as simple as that the
rest is really just details
now what contributes to a higher
fractional breakdown rate
of fat will contribute to fat burning
first
it's just the general metabolism to keep
you alive like if you stop moving all
together
when you eat very little food you're
going to lose weight and you're going to
lose fat how come
well most of your body's processes the
most of the energy
is required for you just goes to keeping
you alive like operating your sodium
potassium pumps and a whole other stuff
keeping your heart beating that sort of
thing important stuff right your general
metabolism
takes quite a few calories resting
metabolic rate uh
basal metabolic rate estimate that
pretty well but that's not it
your daily activity or what's known as
your neat non-exercise activity
thermogenesis
the amount of times you will walk to the
fridge and back the amount of times you
mess around with your house and try to
extract clean stuff when you're at work
how much
how often you walk back and forth how
much you fidget even if you walk instead
of taking the bus that sort of thing
neat
it's not necessarily intentional
exercise you're not trying to burn
calories
but just moving around doing your daily
tasks throughout the day and even just
being fidgety can burn a ton
of calories and is the next biggest
source of calorie burning of course
after that the last source really is
intentional exercise
like yeah you can get on the treadmill
or the bike or something and do some
hard training
that's totally cool weight lifting
certainly counts there it doesn't burn a
whole lot of calories it does burn some
and lastly sort of an addendum to this
adequate sleep and lower stress
literally allow fat to be liberated and
allow all of these
sources of fat burning to be maxed out
that if you're high stressed
in many cases especially if you're under
slept fat loss is
really really inhibited on the other
hand
what are the contributors the main ones
to
uh lower fat building here there's
really just one
calorie intake control macronutrients
matter a little bit but really
fundamentally it's all about calories
if you eat 2 500 calories a day and
you're not losing any weight
and you switch to eating 2 000 calories
a day and you start losing weight
congratulations you are now eating
few enough calories for there to be a
difference in fbr and fsr
and all of a sudden you're losing fat
it's really basically that simple so
essentially you want to move more
somehow
probably or through some combination eat
less or at least one or the other of the
two
both is usually the best way in order
for your muscle
to stay on your body you probably want
to train with weights we'll get to that
eventually
and uh eat protein okay sufficient
proteins that your muscles fall off
because
you know this could be basic mechanisms
of weight loss if we didn't mention the
protein in the weight training protein
and weight training make sure it's fat
loss and not muscle loss nearly as much
as we want and really the rest is just
details
it's really just about that
straightforward so basically
move plenty move enough eat not too much
eat plenty of protein and resistance
train and then
the rest is really just details and if
you get all these equations pretty right
which is not that hard to do you lose
fat
all right so what are some of the
reasons and benefits
of fat loss we talked about motivations
but let's talk about what
some consequences are so good things
about fat loss
if you lose fat you become faster almost
always especially within a general
range of non-extremes you become faster
you become more agile you literally
quicker
you become more endurant so your
endurance goes up like crazy you'll
notice the number of
marathon winners that are over fat is
zero okay
you become more flexible and mobile
sometimes stuff's just literally in the
way
right and if you're leaner you become
way more flexible way more mobile and
that's
better for a 50 different kinds of
sports it's better for your posture
long-term health so on and so forth
you become more explosive you can jump
higher you can move quicker under
load and it makes you better just about
every kind of sport that you want
you become less injury prone when you
lose fat because you're moving around
your joints are being loaded by this
back pack of fat that you have all the
time
you take fat away as long as it's not
super crazy way too lean which we'll
talk about later
you become less prone to injury you
become healthier by a long shot
you literally feel better all the time
your sleep improves your feet don't hurt
as much when you walk so on and so forth
and um last but not least your
aesthetics are enhanced
so you may look a bit like more like
what you'd want uh and it could you know
improve your self-esteem confidence and
uh
you know other people might like how you
look and so on and so forth so
tons and tons of benefits of fat loss
but as
always there are trade-offs to
everything so let's talk about the
trade-offs and downsides
of fat loss two specific situations
one is too much time spent losing fat so
losing way too much in a certain amount
of time
or the second one is getting too lean on
an absolute scale we'll talk about that
one in a sec first if you spend too much
time losing fat especially sequentially
in a row
like 16 weeks of two pounds of weight
loss per week
you get a couple of very predictable
things one you risk becoming super super
fatigued so goodbye
support performance weight training
performance all goes down the drain and
your life sucks
right because you're so fatigued all the
time you can you can barely do all your
daily tasks and certainly not enjoy them
next you become weaker because you lose
muscle you lose the energy to power that
muscle and power the nervous system
uh so you become weaker which is really
bad for almost everything
and of course less muscle is the next
one oh the weakness happens though
through energy
unavailability at any one time and of
course muscle loss over the long term so
less muscle
um you become weaker but the lost muscle
thing is independently a thing
because you know you probably don't want
to look like a super skinny person who
looks sick
like a lot of times you know people do a
fat loss diet but they don't do the
muscle conserving part
uh and they go through too fast due to
their crash diet and people like hey you
know you look kind of sick are you okay
and you're like no
damn i'm not sick i just lost a bunch of
father oh sorry just looking out right
um you don't necessarily want to end up
looking like uh you know willem dafoe or
something like that no offense wound
before you're one of my favorite actors
uh you know when you lose fat you get
all super gaunt um you don't want that
you lose muscle you sort of
you know your limbs kind of look like
you know stuff's falling off not great
but if you go slower
more measured approach you don't lose
muscle you look shapely you look strong
you look fit all that good stuff
um because you're weaker you
have less strength less power less speed
less endurance which is real bad
so if you spend way too much time losing
fat for a marathon race or something you
can actually be hurting your training
becoming less endurant
after during the time that you're losing
fat and especially after you get crazy
rebound
hunger like you can eat the kitchen sink
and that kind of feeling can persist for
weeks and weeks and weeks
which can rebound a lot of your fat
gains right back
um you can have a lowered uh
non-exercise activity thermogenesis for
a while
lowered meat which means like during the
time that you're losing the fat
it becomes incrementally harder to lose
weight because you just
move less like you choose to take the
bus a little bit more than walking
um you're going to change the channel on
the tv but you're so tired not of it
that you're just like whatever i'll just
watch this
you're less fidgety you guys notice
sometimes like you talk to someone on
the phone
and instead of sitting in one place you
pace around you use your hands you're
really animated
if you're over guided then you might sit
and talk to someone on the phone
and just kind of stay pretty monotone
and not say a whole lot and
actually this happens all the time
sometimes you actually become less
social when you're
super over guided you stop talking on
the phone much at all so
people call you and you look at the
phone and you're like i don't have
energy for this right now and you just
sit there
that lowers your calorie intake making
fat loss even harder you have to cut
food even more which magnifies the
problem
positive feedback loop that goes
straight to hell um and of course that
means you'd
have a difficulty of losing more weight
which is what sort of wanted
and it's a really really bad deal a
chance of
rebounding weight and of course if you
take this to really crazy extremes
you can develop some disordered eating
patterns nothing good over here right so
we have to make sure that if we lose fat
we'll talk about this in time courses
later
i'm not doing it too much at a time or
for too long
next up what's the problem with getting
too lean so
if you try to sustain under 13 in most
cases for a female
and for a male under seven percent what
can you risk well you can risk worsening
health especially for females
that need higher fat levels to keep up
normal levels of reproductive hormones
on that note you can get reproductive
disturbances if you're a male below
seven percent in most cases your sex
drive is going to be down to what the
hell is sex anyway
and if you're female your sex drive uh
may change
uh but the reproductive services for you
actually more serious than sex drive
because you will stop being a fertile in
a technical sense you will go into
amenorrhea
you will not have periods anymore and
ovulation will stop uh that's a real bad
deal
so uh you know if you are super super
lean for a little bit that's okay but if
it's for years and years it actually
causes
bone problems for females and a lot of
other bad stuff
and then a lot of times people who want
to get that lean or
athletes and they're trying to gain
muscle and strength in the grand scheme
if you stay too lean for too long
as a female or a male that hormonal
environment can
lead to a lot of trouble gaining muscle
and strength so some people they're at
seven percent body fat and someone's
like hey you're trying to get bigger
they're like yeah totally and they're
like okay well you're gonna
gain a little body fat like no no i just
want to stay this lean and the thing is
staying that lean can actually be bad
for muscle gains
so not all is rosy basically
losing fat is super good if you have the
fat to lose and it's not going to make
you too lean
or if you can lose the fat for a short
time a couple of weeks a couple months
and then go back
totally fine um or if you don't
screw things up by dieting for way too
long or losing way too much weight at
once
but in general fat loss is really good
for you you just have to make sure
you're not doing stupid which people do
all the time as you may imagine
all right so what are the general
nutritional approaches that we'll talk
about on their own sections
that are going to get us to where we
need to go well first super simple
hypocaloric diet eating fewer calories
than you burn
results in tissue loss eating enough
protein
will make sure that most of the tissue
lost isn't muscle it's actually fat
really good eating enough carbs and
enough fats to support your muscle and
performance
so that you can keep the muscle tissue
on keep the energy
to keep the calorie burn going so on and
so forth so not trying to starve we're
not trying to cut all the carbs for no
reason we're still athletes we still
want to perform
reasonable timing right like if you
don't eat for like eight hours at a time
and then you eat a bunch of food uh you
know you're gonna lose some muscle there
that probably you won't get back
uh or at least until you start gaining
weight again so if you do intermittent
fasting
it's okay it's a fine way to lose fat
but you might be risking a little bit
more muscle loss especially if you're
advanced
so just some reasonable timing you know
at least four meals per day evenly
spread with plenty of protein
after that it becomes less important
some food composition uh considerations
which are really important in hunger
management for example so
can you diet on whey protein pure sugar
and olive oil yeah probably but you have
one of those shakes
in another two hours later you're gonna
be starving but if you have
you know chicken grilled chicken breast
a bunch of fruits and veggies which tend
to digest for a very long time and keep
you super full
and maybe some almonds which have been
shown to really just not uh
they knock out hunger pretty quick and
they don't really cause a lot of weight
gain because people really overeat
almonds
uh and if you do though that kind of
food you know good healthy food that's
slow digesting and that is very
anti-hunger then you can potentially
just not be as hungry
and that's really super awesome because
it can enhance your adherence and we'll
get to that
why that's important in a second lastly
on the main principles
some supplements help specifically
stimulants we'll get to that
towards the end of the series and of
course keeping proper hydration
is good for a variety of reasons it's a
super small priority remember
uh the rp diet 2.0 diet priority pyramid
the hypochloric diet is by far the most
important
eating enough protein carbs and fats
secondly timing so on and so forth
supplements a very very very um small
effect and so is hydration all right
now here's the important thing
consistency actually underpins
all of these things when we say
consistency we mean consistency in
maintaining
a hypocaloric diet consistency in eating
enough protein carbs and fats
consistency in keeping reasonable timing
how consistent you are will reflect
exactly to what you actually apply
right uh you can think of consistency as
how many bullets you're actually loading
into a gun
right if you're shooting zombies with a
30 round clip you use 30 zombies in your
real good shot if you load 30 rounds
you'll
kill kill 30 zombies but if you load 25
rounds
even though you press the trigger you
know like uh 30 times
only 25 bullets are gonna come out and
only 25 zombies are gonna it's better
than 30 zombies but still you got five
zombies to try to
beat in the back of the head with your
you know butt stock or something like
that
so essentially consistency
is you know you can have the best plan
in the world right you can have the best
zombie aim in the world
but you actually have to load your gun
and do what you're supposed to do
to get what you're supposed to get done
and promises and hopes and dreams don't
count it's actually what you do
now a coral area of consistency are
really an expansion of that principle is
actually two different kinds of
consistency
there's frequency consistency and
magnitude consistency
frequency consistency on a fat loss diet
means did you eat
the meals when you were supposed to
right and potentially the answer is yes
right like i haven't missed a single
meal in six weeks and everything on time
or you know i've been on my diet every
single day that's another kind of
measure of frequency
every single day i've been on my diet
you know or i've been on my diet
for you know six out of the last seven
days it's a pretty good frequency right
you would think
but frequency alone doesn't tell you
everything for example you could have a
frequency
of uh let's say you have a 500 calorie
per day deficit
and you have a frequency of hitting you
know every single meal but
one per week exactly how you're supposed
to with calories macros so on and so
forth
that's when magnitude consistency comes
into play that's the second kind of
freak
or second kind of consistency magnitude
consistency is
when you are inconsistent how
inconsistent are you
so let's zoom in on that one meal we
have a whole week of meals that are
perfect on track
but we have one meal on friday night for
this particular individual example
in which the frequency cons so
the frequency of eating is incredible
there's just one little error which is
like you know you think pretty good
but let's say that meal has
4 000 total calories in it because it's
like a pizza and
fries on top of the pizza and you pour
some ranch dressing on it sounds pretty
good actually
so let's say it's this huge crazy crazy
meal
all right that's potentially a problem
but you say g is one meal right
and i'm sure a lot of you watching
yourselves and many of the clients you
work with people you help
you ask how good have you been on your
diet you try to say to yourself how good
have i been on my diet
and say well you know pretty good um uh
you know i'm just like
gee i've only missed like one meal i've
only like messed up one meal i've been
real good last week
well that's a frequency consistency
analysis what about the magnitude
consistency you say okay so
when you when you were off plan what did
you do like there's a big difference
between
being off plan by 500 calories by eating
uh
a couple cookies okay that means if we
have a 500 calorie per day deficit
every day and then that one meal is 500
plus
then you basically just cancel out one
day uh all right
like not the end of the world but
basically you have like
what six days right of of a 500 calorie
deficit
that's losing almost a pound per week
not quite a pound like you could have if
you didn't have those cookies but
pretty damn close how about this though
the earlier example 4 000 calories of
cheat food which people do all the time
right
like tiny little females can do that
kind of stuff if they're if they're
starved to the bone enough or just lack
willpower enough uh enough adherence
that 4000 calories it's uh 3 500
calories extra on top of what we're
supposed to have
that means every single 500 calorie
deficit you have per day
for the week is filled in with its own
500 calorie cheat
just from that one day the total deficit
of that diet
is zero how much weight are you gonna
lose on that diet
nothing you literally won't lose any
weight
put another way you're dieting 6.6.5
6.75 days of the week
to do what for no reason at all you
might as well just eat a normal diet
and lose no weight and just never have
to suffer but you're suffering for the
whole week
to cancel everything out with one mega
cheat meal so when we talk about
consistency it's important to keep
in track especially if you work with
clients especially if you talk to
individuals try to help with their diets
you've got to analyze the frequency
consistency ask them how often they're
on the plan
right and analyze their magnitude
consistency
when they're off the plan how big of a
deal is it now people lie about this
kind of stuff and
they lie to themselves they're poor
tracking but at least you can get some
kind of feel for it just talking to your
clients for example
the worst case scenario someone who
frequently cheats with a super high
magnitude
that's really bad they're going to be
hyper they're going to gain weight
happens all the time next
is a high frequency of
off-plan eating high frequency
inconsistency
but the magnitude of consistency isn't
really that bad so there's people like
you know i have an extra half a cookie
here and there an extra piece of like
carrot or something
not the end of the world although if
it's a really high frequency it can add
up to again
you know most people gain weight like
that but they can maintain their weight
or the weight loss is just way slower
lastly uh we have uh or you can have
also like
you know high magnitude but really low
frequency once every two weeks they have
a cheat meal
can still block a whole lot of fat loss
and if it's once a week they can just
block all of them ideally you want both
as low as possible
so let's say once a week they have
something off plan but it's like an
extra cookie
they're going to lose weight just fine
they're going to lose fat like crazy
it's not a super big concern
ideally would they not have a cookie
sure right because also you have one
cookie it can make you crave others
so on and so forth but if you just stick
to that totally fine
so you want both kinds of consistency to
be in place
and consistency we usually talk about on
the course of days
and a week here and there duration of
the diet
is really also important so if you want
to get super lean but you're only
willing to die for three weeks at a time
gee it's not enough time to lose a whole
lot of weight
duration multiplies the effect of
consistency so how do you lose weight
you do all these pr
principles like we described you do them
consistently in both frequency and in
intensity or sorry frequency and in
magnitude and then you multiply that
consistency by doing a duration of diet
that's meaningfully long
8 to 12 weeks if you stick to a 10 week
diet
super super well and it has all these
other things you're going to lose fat
and there's not going to be any mystery
about it almost all
problems with fat loss are not
physiological in nature they're not
nutritional mysteries
they come down to messing up the
principles
more often principles are just fine or
good enough
and it's the consistency that's a
problem frequency magnitude
both and or the duration isn't high
enough that's basically what it comes
down to
now on the note of duration what are the
typical time courses
well first of all the first week is
almost all water weight loss so don't
get used to that number on the scale
moving down like that people say i lost
six pounds my first week
next week if you lose two you'll be
lucky all right because a lot of it's
you know you lose in intramuscular
glycogen you've been eating like crap so
you have you know
more salt intake as soon as you clean up
your diet you have less salt intake
less glycogen and all of a sudden you
lose a lot of weight okay so that
definitely happens
and then within a month of dieting you
can notice some physical appearance
changes
notice how you feel a little bit within
three months really meaningful changes
can occur you can lose
five to ten percent of your weight and
potentially your body fat
um that's really really good stuff right
that is definitely uh
you know five percent for sure is
realistic in a three months so that's
really really good
and uh the problem is some of you say
okay well if i die for six months
straight then i'll just lose a crazy
amount of weight or remember
there's the dieting for too long at a
time problem we described earlier
so you can't diet for years at a time
without breaks you want to take breaks
every now and again there are also many
months of eu caloric isocaloric periods
in which you're just at maintenance so
basically you lose fat lose fat lose fat
reach about three four months maybe
take a maintenance phase that's another
three or four months and then lose fat
again
so when lots of weight is required 15
plus total body weight for you to lose
many phases
of fat loss and maintenance are required
you can't one shot kill it
even though it's super tempting right
and the line there is you know it didn't
take you
16 weeks to to gain 50 pounds and it's
not going to take you
uh 16 weeks to lose it so uh if only if
it was that simple that would be amazing
but it's going to take you
you know you can lose 50 pounds in 6
weeks or 16 weeks it's just not going to
be sustainable you're going to balloon
right up after
uh most almost everyone does and if you
ever uh
skeptical of that look up the uh data on
the people who did the biggest loser
challenge
uh for tv and see how many of them are
still lean
it's depressing that's a perfect example
of a one-shot kill attempt
what's ahead what do we do in the next
couple lectures we got a lecture on
calories and macros for fat loss lecture
on timing food compound supplements
i'll lecture on ranges and durations for
weight loss what the optimal
vectors are there how to measure
progress
how to periodize fat loss to make sure
you're getting the most out of your
program of the long term sustainably
how to adjust calories macros timing
food comp etc
when your diet stalls when losses are
not coming at the rate we want
and lastly we're going to have a
discussion lecture number eight is myths
misconceptions
special circumstances in fat loss folks
i will see
you for lecture two next time
