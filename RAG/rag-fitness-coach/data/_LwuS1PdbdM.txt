hey folks dr mike here from renaissance
periodization welcome back to targeting
the muscle series here is a dumbbell and
as a matter of fact we have two
because we're gonna be doing dumbbell
flies today and talking about how you
can target the chest a little bit better
feel out the chest if you're having
trouble feeling the chest on these we've
got tips let's get right into tip number
one
first tip to feel the chest more in
dumbbell flies is to use as much
momentum and as much weight as possible
no wait i said that wrong what you want
to do
is take your scapulae and retract them
what that does is it pre-stretches the
pecs for you it opens them up it reduces
how much front delt activation you're
going to get in this exercise and puts
your chest at a pre-stretch stretch
under load is a very very potent
modality by which we encourage muscle
growth so instead of and uh scott's
video guy if you want to
pull the camera around to the side here
instead of dumbbell flying like this
which is fine when you get the dumbbells
up here and if you start here whatever
shoulders are retracted like that
notice my chest is already up shoulders
back
and then you go nice and deep always
deep that's not even a tip we have
because it should be obvious
super deep stretch
and back up and as a matter of fact i'll
just do tip number two right here
[Music]
part of the process of retracting your
shoulder blades already pushes your
chest up if you arch your back just a
tiny bit
your chest is going to be elevated and
here's the deal as you go down what you
want to focus on is reaching up with
your chest and then back up so as you
descend lower and you feel that stretch
reach your chest into the sky and it'll
make that stretch way harsher you'll
feel tons of pain in your pecs and that
is actually going to enhance hypertrophy
so what we don't want is the opposite
and i'll show you guys the opposite
shoulders out doing some kind of partial
range the chest stays caved in versus
shoulders back
and as you go down reach your chest up
into the sky this will blow your pecs
into the stratosphere
all right next tip is a choice for you
guys like a lot of these tips trying a
few different variations and seeing
which one lets you feel your chest the
most
there are kind of two ends of a spectrum
for how to do flies
one of them and i'll show you guys just
with my hands here and then i'll
actually demo it on the bench
one of them is to go down and let the
flies let your elbows come a little bit
close to your body and sometimes that's
really good from a shoulder comfort
perspective the closer your elbows come
to the body the more it's front delts
and probably the less it's pecks
on the other hand you can as you come
down let your elbows trend backwards
essentially up towards your head and
that can really open up your pecs a ton
and give you a huge connection the thing
is it might not feel amazing for your
shoulders if you're having trouble
feeling your pecs in this
try the opening up and shifting the
elbows back towards the bottom method if
it's good for your shoulders it might
really help with your pecs but some
people based on various muscle
architectures and limb anthropometries
actually seem to feel the muscle way
better if they have a little bit closer
angle so try both so if we're going to
set up our dumbbell fly we're going to
use all the right cues we're going to
retract okay the first method is just
doing kind of what feels natural and
that's totally fine right and then the
other method is as you go down
you go out and there's going to be a
visible arcing
back and up towards your head and that
can really really hit the spot
super well
try both don't be dogmatic about it see
which one you like best
best case scenario they both work really
well and you can just do one for a few
months and do another for a few months
and then you'll have the biggest packs
of all times and uh you know the davinci
of 2040 will cover statue in your honor
it'll be one giant
[Music]
all right last tip and then a quick
clarification which can be a tip of
itself so if you're having trouble
feeling your pecs a slow eccentric slow
descent and a pause can really be a
savior yes it's absolutely fine to just
do the flies in one smooth motion
however
having trouble feeling impacts slowly
centric is really good so let me show
you what that looks like set up our good
technique shoulders back chest up
slow slow
slow at the deepest most painful stretch
reach your chest up and pause for two
seconds one
two
ah
slow
slow
chest up
and up just like that that will
absolutely help if you're having trouble
feeling it now a related question comes
up to this about cadence and range of
motion and stuff is should you clank the
dumbbells together at the top
the answer is it doesn't matter
because if you clank them they can give
you a nice sensation of yeah i
accomplished a rep but honestly if you
just come back here to where gravity
points up and down going from here to
here gets you nothing you say but dr
mike my inner pecs well where is the
force factor from here to here the force
factor would have to travel parallel to
the ground and unless you're in a rocket
that is accelerating
laterally to the ground that's not a
thing so i would recommend not clanking
as a first thing so just get up to where
you don't feel tension anymore and then
come back down but if you have to clank
them hey
clank away to your heart's content
folks thank you so much for tuning in
that's all we have for flies if you have
any more questions about the flies
please put them in the comments below if
you want another chest exercise
addressed please uh slide into the
comments slide into the dms
is there such a thing as dms in youtube
probably we never check them
two more things if you have any exercise
you want us to do please put in the
comments we'll absolutely get to it if
i'm able to do it oh and one last thing
see you next time
you
