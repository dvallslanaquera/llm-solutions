why are you doing 205 when i'm doing
this
because you're better and i'm doing 17
reps and you're also probably doing 17
reps what's going on
you're better than your 245 inherent
goodness to you
it makes you stronger because the
assertion here is
that you think i'm equating goodness
with that
your sandbag why why do you keep
fighting don't try to keep the family
together
[Music]
hey folks welcome it's thursday
am push tricep emphasis this time
starting with a close grip slow
controlled eccentric
yes you can absolutely do the regular
high force version
we're a little bit sore in our packs
because we slightly over to the volume
last time
no big deal some new machines we're
going to do slowly centering to keep
things nice and safe
really tricep focus post refreshing
after that
we're going to do a big tricep extension
thing where we do a heavy set than a
light set right after kind of a
drop set and then we do like four or
five of those it's a lot of volume
and then afterwards we're probably going
to do some sort of dumbbell press
again emphasis on the triceps but some
good chest in front delta activation
great pushing
later today we're going to do another
shoulders biceps and forearm session
that's number two for the week we have a
third one in total
let's get started the first exercise
close grip bench
slow eccentric on the smith machine nice
tricep stimulus good chest stimulus nice
and safe because we're still a bit sore
let's hit it
[Music]
ah ugh
[Music]
[Music]
um
technique great rer
lyle lyle listen
we don't know how to go to failure
i honestly just i'm a fraud jared's an
idiot
charlie doesn't speak english making him
vote
lyle we need your help lyle mcdonald we
need your help
please let us come to austin texas teach
us how to train hard
the number of people you coach reflects
your knowledge your physique reflects
your knowledge
the fact that you're not just a guy in
the internet yelling at people we're
going to come to austin you're going to
teach us how to really train for once in
our life
and that'll be that
[Music]
the astute observer will notice that i'm
using significantly less weight
than charlie interior in this exercise
there are two good reasons for this one
i'm not that strong
two my pecs are still a little bit
tender so i opted for a flowery centric
version with lighter weight
so i can still get a good robust
stimulus but because my fastest fibers
aren't healed yet
i don't want to risk injury and because
they're not healed yet might as well hit
the slower fibers
and still get a good stimulus so
sometimes you have to make intelligent
alterations like that
especially when your volume loads are
real variable travel and stuff like that
don't train sore
especially heavy recipe for probably not
great
so tricep extensions we already did a
compound
heavy close grip movement for the tricep
now it's isolation time so we're
basically doing compound isolation then
compound a little sandwich for triceps
the push downs are going to be really
strict we all have slightly different
ways of doing them
there's no like super correct answer
it's whatever's the best stimulus to
fatigue ratio
so give that a shot we're going to be
doing sets of 10 to 20 reps
except we're going to do one set and
then immediately with basically no rest
do a drop set as fast as possible to get
a little bit more
metabolite burn on the triceps a lot of
times push down with just one
failure point in the actual rep or in
the actual set
tends to be a little bit under
stimulative as far as i can tell so that
way instead of doing just four sets
we actually get sort of eight sets
because we approach failure twice in one
set by doing a drop set give it a shot
see what you think
[Music]
using 10 aria alright now let's see
where he finishes
we've got nine left
[Music]
how many are with a fake one r
you know like six ir to one real quick
[Music]
[Music]
ah
i can't forget that they're too big to
put their elbows in
i'm not
[Music]
so
incline dumbbell press is the last
exercise
this is going to be pre-exhausted for
sure with the tricep extensions
beforehand and the close grip work
so almost certainly the limiting factor
here will be triceps especially in a
dumbbell press where you can't just sort
of lock into yourself
and use whatever you can including the
chest to press it if your triceps are
tired you will fail on the extension
portion
so this is a really good exercise to
finish off with if the triceps are still
the main target
which they are let's get to work high
quality full range of motion controlled
eccentric
and what the hell is behind this door uh
i don't know but we got uh dumbbell
press next
[Music]
[Music]
so
you do i want to show you how to do this
movement correctly we got charlie's
eccentric on this yeah
[Music]
[Music]
one
[Music]
that's how you control an eccentric
that's how you do a set correctly
thanks for coming to my youtube channel
because it's dr mike
hogwash and it's calhoun you're cool
you can say nobody you don't mention the
camera guys
all right folks that was the workout
charlie's looking big
america's looking grand that's the deal
uh that's it three exercises tricep
emphasis push
thursday am we'll see you guys later for
thursday p.m which is going to be more
bi tips shoulders wound forearms if we
owe it in germany
that's my german accent europeans don't
get upset i got more impressions if
you're coming up
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
