hey guys
dr mike izzertel here for rpu
and rp plus going to be talking or
introducing
one of our first courses after you have
gotten
through the introduction to sport and
exercise science
and this is one of our most foundational
courses
introduction or to another course is
called theory of science
and today it's the lecture one
foundations for the theory of science
so what the heck is a theory of science
what's on the agenda
well let's see we're basically
introducing
you guys into the world of
first of all understanding what science
is and second of all learning to think
more like a scientist that doesn't mean
you have to become a scientist at the
end of this course or at the end of
all the courses you're gonna sort of
take on rpu
but if you learn to think like a
scientist does in a measured
logical systematic way then you can
start to figure out a whole lot more
stuff and be much more certain of your
conclusions
fall for less hype in bs and just be
very much better off
and make better decisions which is what
education is really all about
so i'm going to talk about the nature of
reality a little bit
because science has a whole lot to do
with figuring that out we're going to
talk about how to best perceive reality
and figure out what reality is because
some stuff is pretty mysterious and we
have some things
to get over we're going to talk about
exactly what science is
and then a future or directions into
where to take
our new understanding of what science is
and how best to apply them
so starting out with some really really
really philosophical stuff
the first question well the claim is
that science i think or something like
tends to observe the real world but
before we get to that we have to ask
if there is a real world if you've seen
the movie the matrix
then uh i guess there's still a real
world in the matrix but people
uh just didn't think it was uh the world
they were looking at
so is there a real world
or is it potentially an illusion right
uh
maybe is the real world uh
simply a matter of perception that's
another interesting idea you'll hear
people saying things like that well
you know the truth isn't objective it's
a matter of where you're looking from
and if you perceive it you can if you
believe it you can achieve it that kind
of stuff
um and uh people say you know well your
world that you're coming from is
different than my world
and do people really live in different
worlds do we create our own realities to
some extent
and really the question we're asking is
does reality differ based on who's
observing the reality or is there
an actual world external to our
perceptions
that is in fact real and
we'll talk about how we got to this idea
in just a bit
but a little bit of soft philosophy for
you this is kind of like really
uh you know high level stuff it's not
into the depths
is that nearly all of the evidence that
we're able to collect through a variety
of
examination mechanisms points to there
being an
actual real world so uh
and it's very likely that humans are
just some of the machines
living in the real world and
that our observation probably doesn't
create the world
but rather perceives it so reality is
almost certainly not like a dream where
you create
what you see but much more like
a computer program in which you were
just one of the characters the program
exists very much outside
of just you as a character and if you're
a character in a computer program that
computer program has created you
so the world created you and you live in
it versus you create the world
and are able to change it at will or
something like that
just as a sort of cursory examination of
why and how that's true we can do some
thought experiments philosophers do a
whole lot more of these
very intricate thought experiments uh
more often and by doing these they've
come to a variety of more
kind of dependable conclusions than we
come to here but
we'll do two quick thought experiments
uh to kind of uh assuage our skepticism
that the world is real so let's say
you're
what's called a philosophy a pure
subjectivist
and you believe that subjective
experience that everything that you
experience is something that's created
by your mind
and that there is no actual objective
reality well
if you really do believe that there are
two thought experiments
these are not real experiments at least
one of them would be a really bad idea
in real life
that you can go through to begin to shed
some doubt
on the fact that the world is entirely a
projection
and to probably shift the balance of the
scales into the idea that the world is
probably real the first one is
something a thought experiment that i've
named
the semi truck thought experiment
so if an individual and this is kind of
like par for the course for philosophy
undergrads
uh or our high school students really
convinced of
pure subjectivism that we do in fact
create our perception
and create the world that we perceive
every time like a dream
if one of those individuals is very
serious i would encourage them
to think about what it would be like to
step
in front of a semi truck going down a
road
at 90 miles an hour now
if the world really is all about
perception maybe you could perceive that
the truck isn't there
maybe you could perceive that you're
infinitely infallible and super strong
and the truck would hit you and nothing
would happen
maybe you could perceive that the whole
thing was an illusion and you would
simply wake up
or restructure reality to be on a sunny
beach sipping a pina colada and no more
truck
because it was all in your mind
a lot of people i say probably a
minority of actual philosophers
um huge minority philosophers a minority
of people in general
actually told these views but to pretty
much every single one of them that's not
mentally unwell
a pure subjectivist simply will not
stand in front of a semi-truck
for some strange reason and that strange
reason
is that no matter what they say or
articulate
or conjecture upon and very esoteric
fancy logical
terms they don't actually believe in
pure subjectivism
because if they did they would at least
be amenable under some conditions to
standing in front
of a frighteningly fast semi-truck
approaching
the fact that almost you know by almost
i mean 99.99999 percent
of anyone who in who takes subjectivist
views
very seriously will not stand in front
of a semi truck
uh kind of betrays a bit of their
actual philosophy is that whatever they
use
to sort of mental uh i don't want to say
mental masturbation i think that's a bit
of an exaggeration but whatever they use
to mentally entertain themselves about
what the structure of the world is or
whatever they like to believe
they don't actually believe that well in
subjectivism
because they seemingly don't believe
that they can do anything about the
oncoming truck and they
pretty well believe that if that truck
hits them
then that is simply a very high momentum
containing high kinetic energy
containing object
that hits them and they are also an
object
they are a system of physical machines
the sum total and operation of which
keeps them alive
including allowing their brain to
operate
and the brain is the seat of who you are
and who they
are so they're under the supposition
that once that kinetic energy via truck
arrives to brain it will destroy the
brain and well the whole body with it
and death at very least of serious
injury will result
with no real ability to alter that
outcome
right we could have used a worse thought
experiment for subjectivism
maybe someone could say we know if
you're uh flipping coins or something
like that
and maybe if you really believe they're
gonna more land on heads than tails it
will happen
well you know if you a lot of people
would take that bet
just because there's not much to lose so
if the
you know coin lands on tails more often
than heads unlike you predicted or if it
averages 50 50 like it usually does
oh well you know but i still think
subjectivism as a merit but the
semi-truck thought experiment is very
interesting because
no one takes that challenge for a very
good reason
because deep down at the end of a lot of
philosophizing most people are actually
what in philosophy is termed an
objectivist people believe reality
doesn't negotiate with us but we
negotiate with it and there are objects
outside of our reality
that can damage our reality very much by
damaging
that which produces our own personal
reality the brain
and that brain is a machine and there's
no way to perceive around that if that
machine
is hurt or destroyed bad things happen
including death
so if you ever run into any real serious
objectives and say i don't really
believe in science because how can you
really measure reality when reality is a
matter of perception
is reality really a matter of perception
and if they say oh yeah i really think
so you just explain the semi-truck
thought experiment to them
and watch them get probably at the very
least uncomfortable
and uh i haven't heard a very good
refutation of the semi-truck thought
experiment
i'm sure magneto from the x-men have a
pretty good response to that
like shazam but but then again he has
superpowers so that doesn't
count the semi-truck thought experiment
is pretty gnarly it's kind of morbid uh
by kind of i mean completely and people
can say
well you know that's really crazy not
everyone's getting hit by trucks every
day uh
maybe we could use an example that is
more real world day-to-day
and we can and that example is
uh what i term the alarm clock thought
experiment
so people will say things like well you
know reality is not real and it's a
matter of
our perception we construct reality okay
you got an important interview you have
to go to class
you wake up because your alarm clock
rings at 6 30 a.m
you have to be at the interview by 8 a.m
it's going to take you 30 minutes to
shower
and 30 minutes to get there and you want
to get there a little early grab a snack
whatever
so the alarm clock rings at 6 30 a.m
what percent of people with an important
oncoming interview actually wake up then
well probably most almost all
why what philosophical reason are they
depending on
well they're depending on the fact that
linear time or whatever the shape of
time is
exists outside of our perception no
matter how we perceive
time to be going it's still going
without our permission
there is a reality external to us that
includes the passage of time
and we're also under the assumption that
the alarm clock
it being a clock is in touch
with that distinct objective inalterable
by anything other than quantum level or
super high gravity forces or something
like that
in alterable by us in day-to-day life
and that alarm clock is measuring that
accurately so when the alarm clock says
it's 6
30 in the morning depending on where you
live and what time of the year it is
you can bet the sun is either still not
up or the sun is up
you can bet that it's morning that
people are getting ready to go to work
you can bet the traffic is going to
start to suck and most importantly
you can bet that in about an hour and a
half
of linear passage of time without any of
your permission
you're going to have that interview that
interview is going to happen with you or
without you
and there's not a damn thing you can do
about changing it
so the very same people that will often
argue
well you know reality's subjective
and you know there's differences based
on observers
how many of those people when they teach
their philosophy lectures at
universities
don't wake up with the alarm clock oh
very few
almost all those same people still wake
up at 6 30 when their alarm clock rings
and they might snooze it for a couple of
minutes but they know what snoozing
means
they know it means that they're
squishing the rest of their schedule
which is a fine trade-off to make but
they know it's a trade-off
they know that there's nothing they can
do in their own personal reality
to throw time back how many of you guys
have wished you could do that in the
morning hell yeah i have that dream like
every day
right i wish i could just not have time
and sleep for another eight hours or
something crazy like that but that's not
up to us and that blaring sound of the
alarm clock
is a constant reminder of the fact that
no matter what
people say we are always running under
the assumption of an objective reality
external to us
right so taking those two things
together and of course
philosophical writings of individuals
much smarter and more well-educated in
philosophy than me
we can start to get to the assumption
that the world is real and has structure
and we can observe that structure and
interact with it
is there a chance we have to leave out
just because we're not totally sure of
anything
that that's not really the case is there
a chance that we live in the matrix yes
of course but if that's your big bet
life's going to be really confusing very
difficult and if you do anything really
extreme about that quite short
but if you run on that as a bet of yeah
the world's probably real and we're just
machines living in it
you're going to make a whole lot of
sense of a whole lot of stuff
so is there a chance that subjectivism
is true yeah of course
what is that chance based on all of the
experiences that humanity has ever had
and some total
based on the fact that subjectivism as a
pure philosophy of an individual
actually changing the world by simply
thinking about it has never been
recorded to exist once
that's bad news for subjectivism and
good news for a dependable reality
that is most likely extant it's most
likely there
so we can probably run with the
assumption and be quite safe that the
world is real so we've gotten over that
hurdle
but the world is really
complicated in a couple of ways
first of all sometimes the world can be
too complex to make sense of right away
so for example if you look at stock
prices
altering and fluctuating and up and down
why are they going up and why they're
going down oh my god
the complexity of stock prices is insane
as a matter of fact
very few to nobody can predict where
stock prices are going to go
if you look at a field just an open
meadow
by a forest and you zoom in on anything
there are trillions of macromolecules
interacting in organelles interacting in
cells
making tissues making organs making
organ systems
making the billions of insects you see
right in front of you
different species all kinds of stuff
they're all moving in different
directions
there's 50 different species of plants
all of them have their own molecular
machinery
and all of that is interacting all the
time the real world is
really complicated super complicated
so figuring it out yeah sure the world
has structure
but that doesn't mean it looks like
tetris it's much more complicated than
that so complicated
we can't ever really meaningfully
perceive a whole bunch of it at the same
time
that doesn't mean that we're totally
lost but we're gonna need one hell of a
powerful tool to figure some stuff out
in addition to that the world isn't just
super complex
but perceiving it is a little difficult
at times
because sometimes it can play tricks on
us
reality sometimes is what it seems or
very close
and sometimes it's not for example there
are visual illusions
right if you are unaccustomed to looking
at skyscrapers or
don't know what uh city you're looking
at let's say you're visiting a city and
you haven't been to it before
you can be at the airport and see the
skyline from the actual
uh airplane window right as you're
playing parks at the gate
and go oh my god that one building looks
really tall compared to the others but
it turns out
that building's not that tall it's very
tall but there's five other taller
buildings
it just happens to be closer to the
airport and the other ones further away
so if you were to look for that one
building and be like yeah i want to
visit the tallest building it looks like
this it's a rectangle
people like yeah there's little
buildings that are super tall that have
rectangles you're like no no it's this
one they're like oh that one that's not
super tall and like oh my god i've
misperceived reality
right what about a mirage in a desert
you think it looks like water
unfortunately it's just more desert
so sometimes when we look out into this
meadow of complexity
uh we can't be so sure that we're not
being fooled by our eyes and various
other senses
right so it's not open and shut we don't
perceive the world directly
we have to interpret it sometimes our
interpretations are wrong
secondly so there's a problem of
interpretation
on the input end and there's another one
on the processing end
internal biases that we have can cloud
our judgment
because we want certain things to be
more true than others
right so if you watch a mixed martial
arts fight
and you have a favorite opponent that's
in the match your favorite fighter
and he's fighting against somebody
it's very difficult to see the fight
objectively
if you judge the fight you'd probably
judge it all wrong
because when your fighter got hit you'd
probably be like yeah but those are kind
of shitty hits they look kind of
unplanned they didn't have a lot of
power
they were like little taps ah half a
point here and there
but when your fighter did anything
remotely athletic you'd be like wow i
mean this guy's
really dominating the fight he's showing
great octagon control this is awesome
just because you want some things to be
true or some things to be the way they
are
can heavily cloud your judgment and all
of a sudden the world you're seeing
with your eyes the world you're
perceiving rather
is a little bit different meaningfully
different than what's actually really
happening and that's unfortunate because
you're not getting a clear picture
of what's really going on and going back
to the existence of objective reality
because the world
is a certain way uh you probably in your
best interest to see it exactly how it
is
because that stuff's gonna affect you
right if you really don't want the
semi-truck to be there and you
managed to pull a real big one on
yourself and convince yourself that the
semi-truck's not really gonna hit you
that maybe if you squint like this way
that way it looks like it's gonna pass
you in the other lane
maybe that's not a good idea maybe
there's a semi truck coming at you it's
in your best interest
to find out no matter what you want of
course we don't want to get hit by the
truck but it's probably a good idea
to really perceive its motion accurately
to determine what is the probability
that things going to hit me
right and if that probability is
anything other than very low
it's probably a good idea to start to
plan to get out of the way
so it's important to perceive reality
so the world is basically a huge sea of
variables interacting
with each other like zillions of times
per second
and how do we see its clear logical
structure because we've already assumed
that it has one
and we've discovered much later that it
does in fact have one
but how can we be more certain of
reality than a mere guess
right because remember reality is
important it comes back to bite you
and if you just merely guess you're
gonna guess wrong sometimes so we want
clarity
if we want clarity we're going to need
two things
first we're going to need to quiet our
minds so that we can observe
objectively we're basically want to
eliminate
or control for as much bias as possible
we're going to want to really work on
that and there are ways to do that
to make sure that the world we're
perceiving
is for sure at least closer to real than
we would have been
had we not accepted our bias just a
really quick example
of that from semi-truck experiment is
you look at the truck and you're like oh
it's probably not headed to me
and then you examine your feelings and
you go um yeah
i don't think that because i don't want
it to be heading over here
uh here's a much much better example
right let's say you dragged all of your
friends to the amusement park
because you really wanted to go and it's
awesome there's roller coasters people
are having fun
some of your friends kind of wanted to
go to the lake instead and they got
dragged along and they're cool they're
having fun
right but they're like yeah you know if
this doesn't work out we can just go to
the lake but there's you really want to
be there
and there's like five more rides you
want to ride and you just you lake is
cool but you really want to ride these
five rides you haven't yet you've got to
wait in line
and all of a sudden you see some thunder
clouds on the horizon
thunder clouds look like they're maybe
headed towards the amusement park
now if you really want to quiet your
mind you got to admit something admit
your bias
that you don't want the clowns to be
coming over this way
you really don't you would rather have
just them disappear go back
or at the very least you could say yep
yeah you know it looks like they're
coming this way but maybe they think
they're going to be off the
left the reason you think that
even in your sort of lonely moments
admit that not even think that but
want to think that is because you want
the end result of that process to be we
stay at the amusement park you have a
bias
towards wanting to stay and that's going
to alter your perception of reality
away from what realities actually is
now your friends might have a bias in
the opposite direction so the ones that
really kind of want to be at the lake
instead go oh yeah look look at those
thunder look at that
lightning is going to kill you on that
roller coaster it's going to be terrible
zeus
his revenge is swift we should leave now
because look at those clouds man
that's crazy for sure coming here look
at it they're getting bigger all the
time
they might not actually believe that
deep down but their biases
lead them to wanting to believe that
much more than reality so
a big part about quieting our minds and
there are other ways to do
to to remove bias but one of the biggest
ones is simply admitting
what do i want to happen and how is that
altering my thinking
it's a really powerful weapon and then
if you actually succeed in altering
or or sort of countering for that you go
okay i definitely want to stay here
but really what do those storm clouds
look like they're doing
well it looks like they're not moving
yet so let's i'm going to tell my
friends hey listen
if those clouds are coming over here you
guys are right we should just head off
the other direction to go to the lake
totally but if they're not heading over
here
let's stay let's give it an hour see
what happens that's an objective
response based on reality
and then as reality updates and the
clouds are looming and coming closer and
you can see the rain coming down a
couple miles away over
you know the horizon you got it's time
to go
right or if the clouds just kind of
wither away or go off on their own and
there's more sunshine you're good to go
and keep
you know riding your favorite roller
coaster so
that's how we're you know gonna start
with just the idea of quieting our minds
so we don't have to
be as biased but we also want to quiet
the noise the complexity so that we can
see the
only the variables that we want to know
about
right because very complex situations
with variables going each and every way
it's really difficult to assess what's
actually going on
right so we want to make sure that we
have tools to quiet our mind so we can
perceive more accurately
and quiet the surroundings and quiet the
area
to make sure that we can perceive in
a way that is one effect at a time
for example if someone brings their dog
to the park
and claims that it can do really cool
tricks and
he's giving the dog food and telling it
to do tricks and it's kind of not
are you going to believe that the dog
actually can't do tricks
well maybe but there's like 50 other
dogs around and everyone's grilling hot
dogs and stuff like that
so the dog's only goes and you can tell
when it's looking at the owner
right the owner said come on do your
trick fido and fight us a good oh my god
okay
the owner trick but hot dogs other dog
smells craziness outside
right it's super complicated environment
it might not be the best environment for
us to perceive the exact effect we're
looking for
so maybe it's a good idea after the park
for you to come back to that uh
friend's house with a dog everything's
quiet it's the same house all the same
smells dog calms down
he's like okay watch this do it fido
fido doesn't do anything
you should be like okay bro we've
isolated a lot of other variables it's
his house the usual environment
not a lot of complexity he's still not
doing anything you know what you're
right
i just don't think he learned it
yesterday was doing it but it just
didn't hang in there
so there's a lot more to say and how
we're going to do that scientifically
but those are the basic ideas
a quick example uh or further examples
of how we could do that
so we could ask the question in sport
and exercise science
does squatting lead to bigger legs than
lead pressing
first of all we have biases to squash
before we can even begin to design
uh some way of ascertaining that
information
a bias i have is i like squatting better
leg presses are cool but squats are
hardcore most of you guys probably think
that
so a lot of you would say oh of course
squats but if you really had to design a
study
that was objective you got to quiet
those biases so you don't accidentally
favor the squat group versus the leg
press group or something to that effect
and you have to quiet complexity you can
say okay well so
all the guys that squat you know they
have bigger legs
than the people at leg press yeah but
the people that squat also tend to be
more serious about lifting so they're
more consistent
the people that tend to leg press on
average tend to be people that just
don't want to train very hard so they
use a machine instead of free weights
people squat also have good technique
which means they're more invested in the
process
those kinds of people tend to grow more
they probably eat better too they
probably sleep better
so if you have a bunch of really big
squatters with big legs but a bunch of
people leg pressed with not so big legs
it's not quite certain what would happen
if those big squatters brought that same
tenacity
and objectivity and desire and really
good nutrition etc
to a program designed primarily around
leg presses
so it's very difficult just from
observation to be able to make okay so
clearly we just have people who like
press people that squat
and the leg press but people aren't as
big so squats lead to bigger legs not so
fast because we haven't isolated all the
variables there could be
too much complexity for us to see the
real truth how are we going to acquire
to the truth well this is
starting to sound a whole lot like
science now
so what is science it's a systematic
method of observation
that does two things it quiets our
biases and it quiets the complex
external world to reveal the
relationships
between only our variables of interest
it allows us to see patterns to see
relationships
of the things we want to see in a clear
environment that is unbiased both by
external factors
and by own mind thus science is a path
towards the proper observation of
reality
that's really what science is all about
how do we quiet our biases well
usually we do it by rigid and formal
study design that doesn't give advantage
to any outcome
right it's no longer a matter of
perception but the study
is set up to collect certain data and if
you design the study right
really doesn't matter what you want to
happen the methods are going to speak
for themselves
and how do we quiet the surroundings
well
a lot of times there's no way to make
things super quiet
but we know that most things we have the
variables that we want to measure
and everything else is just noise but we
can kind of assume
that the noise is very similar all
around
so what we do is we basically let the
random noise cancel itself
out and the only things we're changing
are the only things different between
our comparison
is the presence of the actual variables
or the absence of their actual variables
or the variables are pointing up or
they're pointing down
everything else is still super
complicated but the only difference we
have is between what we're looking at
thus if there's a difference in those
two systems after that if what we're
observing is different
we can start to become fairly sure that
because those variables we changed were
the only thing different
there's might be a cause and effect
there or at least something to look into
so if we do that fundamentally we're
being scientific
and the scientific method is defined
very technically dictionary definition
as
the procedure that consists in
systematic observation measurement
and experimentation and the formulation
testing and modification of hypotheses
and the huge take-home message from that
is that it is systematic right
in the next lecture we'll talk about
hypotheses and theories and all this
stuff
but systematic is what science is all
about science is not a random guess
science is not oh let's take a look here
and see how we feel about things
it is systematic for two reasons one
it's systematic to quiet our biases
to it is systematic to quiet all of the
fluctuation of the external world
it's not systematic for no good reason
it's not like that uptight teacher who's
uptight for no reason
right science is uptight it's systematic
so that
all of the other effects all of the
illusions can wash away and
only reality remains
there are two ways in which science is
done that reflect its structure
two kinds of studies observational
studies
and experimental studies in
observational studies
we kind of compare situations that are
already ongoing
let the noise cancel out and we can get
a really good idea of what correlates
with other things
so for example if we look at
sunburn we try to see what correlates
with sunburn
we can see that well you know
sunburn seems to go up a whole lot
during summer
is there something about summer that
causes more sunburn
maybe right is there a cause and effect
is there something about summer
that causes sunburn maybe
also maybe right so
great for generating hypotheses but then
we actually have to test those
hypotheses great for generating ideas
about how the world works but then we
have to test them so how do we test them
well then we manipulate
the actual variables ourselves
and then we measure the results so the
noise cancel out
and we can measure cause and effect and
no longer just correlation
experimental studies are the golden
fleece of science they really tell us
what's going on
because now we're the ones changing
stuff so if you think
that it's the radiation from the sun
that is more pronounced in the summer
that causes sunburn
then what you can do is get uh some kind
of tissue sample
and then you can subject it to radiation
you're the person that you've got two
tissue samples one is getting subjected
to radiation one is an identical
environment and not getting subjected
radiation
and then 15 minutes later you can
examine them and see if that skin sample
gets burnt or not and if it does well
gee
you looks like you found out what's
going on in very basic terms there are
better ways to control that study
but fundamentally if we are altering the
system
and we know what alterations we made and
what we didn't we can start to conclude
with pretty high degree of certainty
that the alterations we made are becau
or or the differences that emerge in the
systems are because of the alterations
we made
so now what is the relationship of
science to the truth
the thing is is that in all those
examples i described and all the studies
ever done
no study is perfect because it has
an error probability there is a chance
that the skin samples we got one of the
skin samples
something happened to it earlier we
don't know what it is but that's what
really causes burns
and it was simply accumulating all that
damage and transforming it into
something we could see an actual burn
and then when we shot it with
ultraviolet irradiation
uh that was just superfluous had nothing
to do with what's going on
and it turned out that the sun has no
effect on sunburns at all
that our study was flawed we could
have a chance event occur so for example
the knob that turns on
the radiation source could be broken and
we didn't know about it
so we said we're exposing it to
radiation and in fact the light turned
on
but the light turned on and it's like a
light bulb's worth of power because the
knob
we were supposed to turn it all the way
to high but everything passed low just
doesn't work
we assumed it did but it didn't right
that's where error comes from a lot of
the times is just
the study screwed up and you don't know
it did so when all of a sudden we got a
light bulb here we got
you know plenty of light in the room on
the other sample
we noticed that there is no effect and
we say gee
oh man i i guess the radiation from the
sun doesn't actually burn anything
because there's
some you know the skin wasn't really
burned and we we subjected to radiation
studies make mistakes all the time they
usually don't
but there's a small percentage of chance
that every study makes a mistake so
knowledge is never perfect
but science is really cool because we do
study after study after study and the
more studies we do if they continue to
point in the same direction
science gets us closer and closer to the
truth
right as the variables we're examining
get
more examined and we find out more about
their details we get more precise with
what we're looking at
we can be more and more sure what we're
looking at is the actual logical
structure of the universe
put another way we can be closer to the
truth
one study is okay not a whole lot to
learn there but if we do multiple
studies in every conceivable angle and
direction
testing the hypothesis from various
points and it all
shows that look you blast radiation at
something it starts to degrade and if
that's human skin it starts to burn
yeah we're probably on to the right
thing now
one of the coolest ways to know that
science
is is one of the coolest intuitive ways
or very obvious ways to know that
science must
be onto the right thing isn't it some
kind of weird experiment
i'm sure philosophers could figure out
50 ways in which we could be diluting
ourselves but where are we not diluting
ourselves
what has science created for us we said
that
science gets us closer and closer to the
truth and if science has been working
for a
long time it's going to get us damn near
to the truth it's going to allow us to
see logical structures
potentially we can even manipulate those
logical structures to get what we want
so what is science given us of what we
want
modern medicine how's that first start
all right so if you really don't think
science is a good way of perceiving the
truth
how come when you break your leg you go
to the hospital
and not like a faith healer or something
you got bone sticking out of your leg
what are you assuming that the surgeon
surgeons at the hospital know
you're assuming they know the structure
of legs you're assuming they know the
bones of the body
you are assuming they know the
procedures scientifically derived of
course as to how to take your bone put
it back into your
leg and sew you up you are assuming that
science is one hell of a pass to the
truth
because your leg is broken and you're
done playing around philosophy games
absolutely sounds like the semi-truck
experiment again maybe you broke it like
getting hit by the truck
that would be a small price to pay at 90
miles an hour so
and it doesn't have to be that morbid
right antibiotics
cure diseases how the hell did they do
that they weren't made by a random guess
almost all modern antibiotics are
engineered they knew exactly what the
bacteria looked like they know exactly
the shape of the molecule
they designed it to hurt that bacteria
that's what they designed it to do
what about astronomy scientists have
catalogued
and figured out a whole lot about
planets and galaxies and everything else
that we see in our universe predictably
they figure the stuff out
and they can tell you hey so in the
night sky in three days there's going to
be a comet
right over there and it's going to swing
by and it's going to swing away and
you're barely going to see it but there
it is
you get your telescope out and sure
enough you're like that they were
bullshitting me there's nothing there oh
my god there it is
they can predict celestial objects to
within seconds of their arrival and
departure
that's pretty sweet obviously they got
something right they're very close to
the truth on there
what about evolution right
evolution very well studied
explains almost everything about the
natural world that's one hell of an
achievement
right you think just about 130 years ago
evolution wasn't even a thing
that most people didn't think that's how
the world came to be
right most people didn't think that's
how animals were designed is by
evolution
what about psychology right if you show
up to a psychotherapist who's good at
his job and practices scientific
psychotherapy that person is going to be
able to talk to you in such a way
that is going to be able to help you
it's going to be able to give you
actual strategies to live your life more
effectively
and happier now how the hell did he know
that he's not just making a random guess
because science showed the path to how
the mind actually works and we're
learning more every day about that it
happens
and now that we know a lot about how the
mind works we can alter our behavior or
alter the mind to make it work better
right what about engineering and
technology
if science really couldn't perceive how
the world worked how the hell are
skyscrapers standing up
how do we have wi-fi wi-fi wasn't around
it's not just some thing it's engineered
how well do scientists know about
electromagnetic signals and their
manipulation
well enough to put information into
digital form and transmit it anywhere in
the world holy that is a high level
of super precise knowledge
right money and trading food production
how much has science discovered about
how to make more food
make it cheaper and make it tastier
while we're supporting a global
population of pushing 7 billion people
now
and we come from an evolutionary
environment where hundreds of millions
or
tens of millions of us spread around the
world were starving damn near half the
time
science has come a long way there is no
reason to doubt science
as the best estimator of the truth but
there is every reason to try to learn
how it works well so we can do it better
consume it better to make fewer mistakes
it's there for the taking when we need
it
right so if we really want to know about
something
what do we do well we apply all the
super powerful tools of science
and we begin to get answers they're
small answers at first
very measured answers well we think that
maybe that and eventually as more
studies come out as more is learned
as more is confirmed we start to get
very very very confident
and eventually our knowledge becomes
comprehensive and amazing
so that if you've got forbid or sick and
you go to the hospital there are
worlds worlds of logical structures of
information
ready to help you and that if you're
sick with anything but some really
exotic thing that no one's ever heard of
before
you're gonna get the help you need
because people have figured out a whole
lot
with modern design so the next question
is how do we do science correctly
and that's in the next lecture so i'll
see you guys then
for lecture two
you
