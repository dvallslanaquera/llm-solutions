those are the last hard step before
you're done with this mask
this is now the time now is the time for
[Music]
[Applause]
hot
[Music]
we are here with some incredibly strong
people
all around jared knight are not
including this category
these three gigantic motherfuckers
all of whom are or have been competitive
power lifters at a high level
and are now bodybuilders some of them
some just really fucking strong are
going to be doing a high volume
hypertrophy leg workout
there may be vomit there probably will
be blood
we'll start with stiff legged deadlifts
for volume and then we're going to just
go probably do one exercise which is the
hack squat
one exercise you may think so easy
one of these three will definitely die
by the end of this movie
let's get it done
i feel like death i feel like it's fall
asleep right now on this bench
so i think i'm gonna end or
fall asleep on the tip floor
more lengthening at the hams
yes gentle touch the ground every time
there you go good control
good twist control
good just backwards
excellent slow slow slow
good slow
couple more we're here to push it
technique come on oh yeah good stuff
good stuff i watch how you lift and
you're excellent at doing the number one
thing you're supposed to
which is putting every possible muscle
to use to lift something
right that's the point but in targeted
variants
what you want to do is bias that a
little bit away to expose a certain
muscle
so like in a jm press if you went here
and here you could do more
but if you go here and here you can do
less but your triceps get hit more
saving the central fatigue and
everything beautiful
control
hamstrings give out yeah that's the
whole point good stuff
very good
gorgeous
big chest beautiful
two more charlie one
[Music]
get those hams feeling it pre-stretch
them there you go
beautiful setup
[Music]
just like that slow
yes slow
gorgeous great slow slow slow slow slow
slow
good slow slow right
yep good slow
slow slow yep awesome
awesome awesome
many of you have long suspected that i
am an albino gorilla that was shaved and
escaped from the zoo
you're not wrong no because that weird
experiment at the zoo granted me super
intelligence i'm able to converse with
you about training principles
here's the thing ben pollock over there
taylor who just
woke up from a back pump and oh
charlie's still alive
they're going to be doing hack squats
now the thing about hack squats is this
it's not about lifting as much weight as
you can it is about
doing it in such a technique that
exposes your quadriceps to the most
tension
so we're going to be playing around with
our technique a lot of these guys come
from strength backgrounds
we're going to be getting less of the
weight on the bar and more of the
tension in the quads
for the optimal hypertrophic stimulus we
said
up to five cents of hack squats i don't
really know if that shit's gonna happen
again please pan over to taylor that's
his current state of affairs
after three sets of stiff-legged
deadlifts let's see what happens
you're going to notice a few things one
these folks are using different loads
that's because some of them are used to
hack squatting some are not
some of them have a different quad
strength hamstring strength blue
strength etc
even in a video like this which is for
fun and all that shit you would think we
would all use the same load bullshit
using the same load is only appropriate
if you're of the same capabilities and
strength can fit in the same rep range
if you can't you change the load
the point of each lifter's experience is
to get the best possible stimulus to
fatigue ratio
using the same weight on the bar as
other lifters is fucking stupid
if it's your hard rule so that's first
thing second thing
you'll notice that folks have different
stances different setups different
positions
that's where they can get the best
stimulus to their quads and the least
fatigue especially as knee
and hip joint pain is concerned
everyone's built differently everyone
has different experience
everyone's muscles are sort of arced and
altered in such a way
architecture wise as to produce highest
forces in one way versus another one
arrangement
feed out feed in so on and so forth
you'll see a lot of differences a lot of
individualizations but the core
technique is the same
strict slow on the way down hopefully a
full pause at the bottom
and good concentric movement with plenty
of power we're going to be doing myo rep
sets
of don't tell the guys 15 to 20 reps per
set
at least to start three to five sets
depending on how much vomit and blood
there is
let's get after it
jerry as soon as he takes his first
break
one of us takes one plate off then
another then another all the way down
four control slow
let's go good rest three
baby three go
go yes
oh my god that's awesome one again

one more one more one more
how fast
