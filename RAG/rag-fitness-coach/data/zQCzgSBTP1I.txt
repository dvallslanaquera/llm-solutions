oh this is so good
rest breathe
oh
this sounds like sex
[Music]
hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization I'm here with Jenna Geary
AKA muscle mommy aka Wonder Woman Done
Right AKA what if Wonder Woman went
Super Saiyan Shazam now Jen is a goddess
and a statuesque but one of her deepest
darkest secrets for vulnerabilities if I
may say is that she thinks her quads
just need to be a lot bigger and she
just didn't know where to look for big
quads and then she was like RP what is
that she made the mistake of her life
again because you've seen her train
quads of us doing hack squats and stuff
this time she's in for glutes and hams
and quads we are gonna do some dead
Lifting for glutes special deadlift
technique uh one or two sets of stiff
leg and ellips at the end to hit the
hams that's easy then leg presses until
something happens and then probably
least some lunges because why not Jen
how are you feeling yourself today I am
great excellent we'll see I was gonna
say we're gonna break it down but you
never do lose your little charm do you
well that's the case folks let's get
into it
[Music]
all right folks first exercise is a
glute deadlift that means it's a deficit
deadlift it looks like a stiff-legged
deadlift starting out once the hams get
to a stretch you want to take them out
of the equation by bending our knees
typically for a stiff legodemic that
would be really stupid because it takes
the hams out of the equation by no
longer stretching them under load by
allowing the knees to come forward
taking the tension off the hams but here
we want that because if your hands can
no longer do the work your quads are
barely in a position to exert much
leverage your hips are hinged to the max
because of the deficit guess what muscle
is the prime mover it's absolutely
glutes will you get an erector pump
spinal Rector pump absolutely lat pump
yes traps yes this is a great 70 of your
body exercise but it really does Target
the glutes if you want glutes and you
want to do deadlift this is one of your
best choices again is going to do a
couple sets of eight to twelve we're
gonna do one set of stiff legged
deadlifts at the end and because this
does get your hamstrings just one set of
slvl should cook them completely to
Golden Brown Perfection and then we're
on two quads let's get it done
slow
yes
up good two more
slow
good one more
slow
good
you got more
slow as if another
slow and drop good good
feeling your lower back a little bit
good that's the deadlift
three kinds of guys in this world
type one
denying that they love the muscle mommy
but secretly they're at home jacking
that dick thinking about muscle mommy
type two
are guys that are just not into it
that's just not their thing no big deal
type three is guys that embrace the shit
Kings
you know what I'm saying
hey you know what I'm saying as of this
video bitch you're single so fellas
getting them DMS you know what I'm
saying not rdms God damn it we don't
need that shit her fucking DMs
slow
that was the best rap of the whole
fucking set
two more
two more good ones slow
good huh
slow
up as if another
[Music]
Brilliance brilliant
get used to that shit all right stiff
legged deadlift regular just like I said
it eight nice and tough same cues as
last time except when you break your
knees push your knees even further back
cool
you ready you need a break you're still
breathing heavy four-factor wrestling a
rest more relax relax relax and we'll go
how do we figure out how much rest gen
needs we have a little problem with Jen
she's a fucking Warrior Princess so
she's kind of like ready all the time
even though she's got like an ax gash
through her body she's like I'm good to
go put me back in we're like Jesus
Christ so the thing is we want to check
a couple boxes before we do our next set
one box is are you still breathing heavy
and is your cardio vest going to limit
you in your next step we're not here to
do cardio we're here to stimulate the
muscles so if you're breathing super
fucking heavy don't go yet wait until
your breathing is more back to normal
the other thing is do you feel strong
and ready if you are fucking in touch
with the reality of what you're feeling
and that answer is not always yes to
that after a super hard set of deadlift
someone's like you feel strong you're
like what the fuck no I felt like I'm
gonna die but a minute or two later
you're like all right feel my slack then
you're good to go is the target muscle
itself ready to do at least another five
reps if your target muscle is still
cramping and squeezing and burning relax
take a break and the thing is synergists
if your lower back is still killing you
lay down lean on something until your
lower back is good and then you're ready
to go we check those four boxes then
we're good to going when Jen is ready
she's not breathing heavy she feels her
swag the muscles are healed and
recovered then we go again typically
that takes about two or three minutes
and then deadlift it can take longer if
you're really strong really big or in my
case really fat I said I had two things
to say that was thing one here's thing
two you guys ready
[Laughter]
let's make this the deepest one yet of
all of them super slow he's back deeper
deeper pause wait wait up
and then as if another super slow
it
Wrath
oh tell me you felt your hamstrings huh
you felt your hamstrings a little bit
yeah good A lot of it
okay all right all right now leg press
put your shoes on I don't have shoes I I
do a Barefoot excellent
couple rules for the leg press folks
number one is you want to push through
your whole foot don't come up on your
toes don't just push through your heels
whole foot push maximum muscle
activation maximum stability maximum
safety maximum growth
another rule is to make sure your hips
are down Square on that pad and then
they're not coming up off the pad it's
okay if they rotate a little bit totally
fine if your lower back doesn't hurt or
feel super awkward you're totally good
don't go down the rabbit hole of being
like buckling's gonna kill me you're not
that fragile nobody has and over time
your body gets used to that shit also if
you're treating your back properly but
deadlift stuff like it elves good
mornings you're not that fragile you are
way good enough to get a little bit of
rotation or fine but if your butt is
coming super far off the ship if your
lower back is visibly rounding not just
Butt Wink like the whole back is going
like that and if it feels painful or
weird
probably have to take your feet and
adjust them down Jenna's super flexible
so she's gonna be able to do this
without weight lifting shoes your boy
here is not that lucky I use
weightlifting shoes and Versa Lift
inside my shoes to get that extra
leverage the pads help me that's what I
need those are the main rules and leg
press today we are gonna do slow
eccentrics not the only way to do it but
a fun option and full one second pause
at the bottom of every rep that means
Jen isn't going to need to use a lot of
weight but she's going to pray to God to
get her the fuck out of here because
it's Gonna Hurt lastly another two rules
of leg pressing and these are
non-negotiable three rules one scream a
fuck load just all the fucking time two
use your hands to help yourself on every
single rep Light press is not a leg
exercise it's a full body exercise and
three brag about your leg press PRS with
shitty technique to everybody you know
call up Grandma tell her hey Grandma
what are you up to say well I have a
shut up listen to my leg pressed yard
Grandma I was gonna say the b word but
that's not nice let's get into some
fucking leg press
good slow
rest for a second two more and you're
done begin now
when a bomb rocks the muscle go
slow pause
[Music]
one more down down down down slow
slow
pause up press back rack Rack beautiful
oh my god oh amazing amazing
oh yeah
feeling the quads a little bit yeah
[Music]
of almost all the leg presses I've ever
used the Arsenal leg press is
essentially one of the best if not the
best
but like every other leg press except 50
times worse than those leg press cases
not this one
the leg presses typically do not have
the kind of shape of back pad that you
would want to keep your lower back from
rounding while getting full ROM in the
quads so what we do is we do a modifier
uh Flex Lewis's gym here Dragon's Lair
had this thing laying around I bought
two of these actually just a few days
ago and they we brought them over to the
gym a permanent gift for Mr Flex Lewis
you're bringing stuff to me fucking gym
I'll cut your fucking eyes out that's
literally what he told me when I tried
to give him a gift get a fucking shite
away from me fucking purple you're
fucking fat I I was like I'm trying to
help in any case he was like it's cool
we put one down here
and then
we'll put one night down here and what
it does is it props your hips up so
they're not sliding all over the place
and generating a ton of unwanted
movement in the lower back keeps it on
the quads keeps it safe keeps it
effective gives you that Mega ROM she
probably doesn't need the help but with
it she's going to get psychotic Ranger
motion
bad news for her great news for us enjoy
up press I'm not here to do upright rows
one more one more get your shit together
take a little break take a little break
take a break and we'll do two more and
you're done for this set okay begin
slow
all you have to do is try your fucking
best deep

leaving before pain slow

loud it's a gym you did say that was one
of the rules one of the rules gotta go
