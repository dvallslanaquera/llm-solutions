oh my goodness folks i'm back barely i'm
here
dr mike's here also barely we're doing
it it's weekly webinar
mike how's it going good good we're
doing a lot of work
trying to finish the hypertrophy book uh
and we are busy i'm actually here with
jared and charlie
uh at the olympia and we're filming a
bunch of videos training with a bunch of
pros
burping uh all good stuff so i'm pretty
exhausted but
let's get this done shall we start yes
time for questions
okay first up is tell me what you got
alejandro
mayofret
mayo fred that's how i would say it
don't fret about the mayo aloha
um all right he says hi docs how would
you program rest intervals for bulgarian
split squats
since one leg is being stretched while
the other one is contracting i don't
know if i should set the timer
right after the second or first leg
finishes actually i'm doing these in my
like
current block of training yeah so
honestly like this is where
james and i develop the four factor rest
model which can be simplified
so like when you're ready to go again
hugo it doesn't matter when you time
them
you shouldn't time them any more
needless like just do both legs
and then set the timer like if you're
going to set a timer because like
you know you can do it after each leg
but god damn that's a lot of work
um i then again you know after you do
i would really just treat every single
leg
like its own um like its own exercise
like its own set
so the one leg ball gear is for squats
that's a set then the other leg that's a
set
because there's some systemic fatigue
that comes along the ride you usually
don't want to just back to back
and then rest um unless that's how you
program it and you're fine with it then
i would alternate
days like next week do the other leg
first right you don't want to
consistently do like your right leg
second every time because
it is under stimulative if you go right
after but
you know you said you're setting the
timer uh again i would recommend the
four factor model for james probably
would too
which basically says after nothing is
limiting factor and you're ready to do
another hard set again you just go
it changes because for example let's say
use 30 seconds every time for you
um you know what if one day you're tired
or your leg
your left leg really cranks it hard
you're just not ready to go after 30
seconds are you gonna have a low quality
set
for your right leg because it's
arbitrary 30 seconds that you've set
yourself
you know and it's funny because james
and i are super super maybe some of the
most quantified
quant guys in the entire industry if we
want to try to quantify everything
we don't time our intervals almost ever
unless we're doing specifically timed
intervals
because you go when you're ready to go
your body tells you when you're ready to
go
sometimes you're ready to go early
sometimes you're not ready to go until a
minute after
so just a little warning there for
overvaluing the
strict timing and go by the four factor
model if you don't know what the four
factor model is just just uh google
hypertrophy made simple rest times and
it'll explain it really well
yeah so that was a great answer so i
think alejandro this is an issue of like
what is optimal versus what is practical
so you i agree with dr mike i think that
um
the problem that you run into is when
you treat them as two different ones it
ends up just taking forever and you have
to rack and unwrap depending on if using
a barbell or dumbbell it just becomes a
big
fuss so for me i'm at a different stage
in my athletic career i'm more of an
adult and i have shit to do and i can't
sit around and wait for these fucking
things all day so when i do them i do
set a rest interval but i set a rest
interval for everything at this point
because i have to
my workouts have to be more expedient
these days i can't just like fuck around
for two hours in the gym
so i always said an interval but i would
do that for everything anyway
so for me i usually set it for about
three minutes and i do kind of the
opposite of what dr mike recommended
knowing that it comes at a cost i always
do the same leg and i do them back to
back
the problem that you run into is right
that you are favoring one leg over the
other so i typically pick my weaker leg
as the first leg and i usually use my
stronger leg as the second leg
and your rir's are going to be off on
the second leg a little bit because
you're already going to be a little
pre-fatigued just from supporting your
body weight up in that rear position
so it depends on kind of like how the
kind of the intersection of like what is
practical and what is optimal so
optimal you would treat your legs kind
of separately in this case give them
enough rest so that there's no
interference and they're getting both
they're both getting the best gross
stimulus if you're on the more practical
side
i would recommend just using a
reasonable rest time so for me like
three minutes i'm like pretty recovered
my right leg the rir is typically a
little bit higher because i'm trying to
match the same
reps with my left leg but that's my
stronger leg so i don't really mind as
much
um so it's a trade-off right for me it's
a practical versus optimal trade-off you
can decide
i wouldn't fuss too much with it though
i'd say pick one and run with it and
don't really look back
boom next up is
mantas
he asks i think you mentioned that it
was harder to build muscle at a higher
percentage
of high percentages of body fat does
that mean even heavier power lifters
should stay lean
most of the year to progress the most uh
not lean but leaner
and most heavily powerless tell you that
when they got super super fat like
titties hanging off the bone fat
it didn't do anything for their lifting
it actually reduced their work capacity
degraded their health and it sure as
hell didn't make him any stronger so
yeah i think that
so i'll actually put some physiques to
this
using strongmen because these guys are
more popular i think off season
for maximum strength you should look a
lot more like strongman physique hofdor
bjornsson
and less like strongman physique eddie
hall like that it worked for eddie hall
but if he was a little leaner at his
prime he probably would have been even
better at the
moving events and just as strong as
everything else um
so yeah getting excessively fat's a bad
idea and power lifters
uh and the thing i like i forgot who
said this but they should just look they
should still look like athletes
like if you go to the store and you're
wearing a t-shirt and
people can't tell if you're just a fat
guy or an athlete you probably benefit
from losing a little bit more fat and
it'll just make you better all around
if people think you're a bodybuilder
yeah you can probably gain a little bit
of fat and
get better at strength athletics so
there's a middle ground there james
this is a huge pet peeve of mine and
montes i'm not directing any of this
towards you because this is a very good
question
but power lifting is a fucking weight
class sport right
you cannot afford to get sloppy fat from
just trying to gain a bunch of
weight and and muscle right what that
means is that you don't take your sport
seriously you're just a recreational
lifter right you're not a power lifter
meaning like you're not you don't go in
with the intent to compete when you get
that sloppy fat like you got titties and
shit that means you are deviating
significantly from your weight class
and you're going to have to spend
however long like twice the amount of
time that you normally would cutting to
get back into your correct weight class
which is time away from your strength
training right which means you're not a
power lifter
you're some chump right that kind of
stuff drives me nuts so
if you are a weight class athlete yes
you need to stay relatively lean and you
need to be
out only a few standard deviations
outside of your competition weight
minus any kind of water adjustments but
pretty close to your
you know making competition weight
throughout the year and when you deviate
too far outside of that means a lot of
time spent cutting and a lot of time not
getting stronger which is a specificity
violation for your sport
etc so don't do that yeah and when
you're a super heavy you know you don't
have a cap
you get fat enough your deadlift will go
straight to hell because your gut gets
in the way
your bench press no longer goes up much
because you you bench better when you're
thicker
but not when you're really fat and your
squat is going to actually start to
suffer because you're a gigantic fat
motherfucker and your trainee is too
your muscle growth is too yeah you
should stay athletic looking
that's it yeah absolutely next up is
sorry oh that's one way to pronounce
tomare
yeah we're just going to take the first
one what are your thoughts on
barbell holds and the carry over for
gripping strength any tips programming
them you know what i feel like we've
done this one a couple times can we do
the other question is that okay sure
sure so he says should i train
two times chest exercises right after
another and then two times back
exercises or should i train chest back
chest back in terms of hypertrophy and
strength
so we actually uh this is something we
literally talk about in the upcoming
hypertrophy book
um i believe i did talk about another
youtube video i think for hypertrophy
you're better off sandwiching everything
together
by a small margin and for strength
you're better off splitting it apart
because you get higher performances
but less direct fatigue less metabolic
stimulation and probably a little bit
poor stimulus to fatigue ratio for
hypertrophy so hypertrophy sandwich
uh everything all you know chest chest
done back back back back done
for uh strength chest back chest back
chest back is maybe a little bit better
but there's very very tiny differences
between the two in any case
yeah i totally agree that's a really
good answer and you might find that for
strength you might not actually be
hitting multiple
exercises of the same muscle group you
might just be doing like one movement
per muscle group per
session and then maybe having another
session of some kind of like pressing
movement for chest later on
but typically you're not going to see
like people hitting huge volumes of
chest for
strength work in particular or back for
that matter same thing
yeah all right payton downs
just a bit of the way down there i'm
glad that the algorithm
or the sorter works pretty much the same
for oh got it um
you got it yes okay actually
it is different now for us great it's
different again um
i haven't done anything i don't know i
know i know
peyton down says any thoughts on the
reverse hyper
uh so i'll i'll get straight to what
you're asking about peyton
no it's not this magical thing that'll
improve your lifts like crazy and heal
all your back pain like louis simmons
says it is
it's mostly shit louis simmons says at
least half it's just straight fucking
dog shit
um the reverse hyper for most people
is a very poor sfr hamstring exercise
it's a fine
dynamic lower back exercise it will
build some erector strength
it's a good exercise with which to warm
up for heavy pulling and stuff like that
so it's good for that
as far as the stimulative exercises if
you get good tension good burn
pump etc for your hamstrings or lower
back using it great
most people don't uh bodybuilders people
trained hypertrophy
and people who train for raw strength um
almost unanimously don't really like the
reverse hyper
people who really love it are westside
acolytes and folks that do equip lifting
for some interesting reasons especially
for its ability to decompress the spine
the reverse hyper has utility there
because you don't you don't see spinal
compression like you do in equipped
lifting
um but other than that it's not this
magical thing and if you really like it
if it works for you
stimulus to fatigue ratio is good
totally use it it's a fine exercise
but don't look for magic you want big
hamstrings stiff legged deadlifts
nine times out of ten will be better
than the rumors hyper and some leg curls
too
so notice that yeah i totally agree with
dr mike here i think there's a
therapeutic value in that potentially
but in terms of like training to get
better at anything uh probably not
yep all right manuel
god damn man well
got me sweating just thinking about who
the man behind this
m is
you got it got it okay
hi docs as fatigue impacts memory and
mental performance would you say the
training for strength
compared to hypertrophy is better during
periods of high demand
higher demand i guess supposedly means
cognitive demand for example during test
finals
whatever my thoughts are that a period
of maintenance is better but i feel like
the best course would be
reserving that for the period of exams
and before that low fatigue period
such as strength training would be an
almost optimal way to get both
best of both worlds um
a long time fan really appreciate work
you guys motivated to study a higher
education improve on all levels thank
you so much well it's really great to
hear emanuel
um unfortunately strength training is
especially at a high level
is probably just a different kind of
fatigue than i'm trophy training and
really isn't in that balance much less
fatiguing if any
and in interestingly hilariously to the
tone of this question strength training
at a very high level
super high rps with heavy loads tends to
in my experience impact cognitive
performance more than hypertrophic
training
um charlie one of my training partners
he's a high level power lifter he
squatted over 800
competition raw and he when he does
strength training it takes so much
mental energy out of him that he's like
sort of half drunk the rest of the day
with hypertrophy training it takes a lot
of physical energy and yeah it also
beats him up but it's like oh my muscles
are sore and they're cramping
but my mind feels pretty clear so
i just wouldn't bet that high level
strength training we really
really try hard just to say good
strength training doesn't zap be worn
out
if it does zap you less it's the clear
answer to use during low cognitive
return
high cognitive load periods like if the
exams and tests are important to you i
would deload before them
or at least take a few recovery sessions
have a lower fatigue take your test and
then go back in the gym and hit it after
yeah definitely a really good answer um
i think a lot of people when they say
strength they kind of mean just like
very
vanilla generic strength training not
like you know strength for power lifting
or strength for weightlifting and
and that's fine i think you answered it
right in the beginning of the question i
think taking like a resensitization
phase maintenance
phase is probably the best option
because you don't have quite as much
heavy loading and you don't have quite
as much of the volume
it's kind of the sweet spot where it
gets you get a little something but
it's not really physically or
psychologically taxing if anything it
tends to be
alleviating for most people so that
would be the best answer if strength
training doesn't take it out of you like
if you just do very kind of
like i said vanilla like three by five
do some bench here do some squats here
you know that kind of stuff that's
probably fine but if you're doing like
you know
more more more rigorous strength
training like training for powerlifting
or weightlifting something like that i
would say that's probably
on par with doing hypertrophy training
like mike said
yep yep yep all right
next up is earth savior oh captain
planet
interesting name got it putting himself
a lot of slack there
if you train an exercise early in the
week but oh
wrong one fuck i i googled it and it was
the wrong one
uh was hold up one sec
uh
boom uh is it wise to introduce
new exercises at the beginning of a
cutting block
or does it make more sense to save new
exercises for the beginning of a bulking
block
so you can reap the benefits of the new
stimulus so the best answer is
is sure that the best answer is
you just ought to regulate exercise
deletion and replacement
uh reflection and replacement the extent
that if an exercise is still
getting you strength still has a high
stimulus to fatigue radiation
tension pumps burn etc low fatigue then
you keep it in
if it runs out of momentum if it's
plateauing if it's hurting your joints a
little bit it feels like you have to try
really really hard to get a big pump
then you delete it
so a lot of times that just occurs on
every occasional meso and you end up
just very organically shifting from your
in and
in um and then as far as introducing at
the beginning of a fat loss phase
the so the benefit of introducing
beginning of a muscle gain phase is you
get really awesome novelty gains
the benefit of introducing at the
beginning of the fat loss phase is that
exercise will probably stay fresh for a
long time
and you'll be able to just coast uh and
use it well and not worry about having
to delete and replace all the way
through your fat loss phase you got like
you got like a sure thing
you know um it's kind of like you know
getting a lot of gas before a long road
trip like you're good for a while
uh so both of them work just fine and
there doesn't need to be a trade-off
between
the two and if you think oh i really
want to save my variance blah blah blah
the answer comes back to it should be
auto regulated anyway you know
it's not like once an exercise goes
south on you
and it's just really stale you're like
alright i'm gonna do it for two more
mesos really
sort of just kill it off so that i can
start fresh on my fat loss mezzo with a
new exercise like dude as soon as an
exercise goes south on you fucking
replace it with something that isn't as
bad as so far
yeah and you know that a lot of the
benefits overlap for
cutting and massing in terms of adding
new new exercises in as mike said it
mostly should be auto regulated but like
the big the big one that applies to both
is a novelty factor which generally
shifts your volume landmarks down
quite a bit so you get to ride some easy
training for the first couple
weeks right so on a cut like if you
introduce a new chest variation like
instead of having to do
you know three to four sets maybe you
only got to do two to three sets right
and that's great and you get to
all the same med milestones and
you get easier training for a little
while but as time goes on it ramps back
up like anything else
and then once it goes flat you switch it
out with something else and you get that
same benefit so
when you do it at the beginning of a
block as mike said you just get to ride
it out you get to ride that low
that low end all the way up to the high
end versus like starting midway and
finishing at the high end midway through
yep brian
p dixon
ryan with a y okay
brian says michael james first brian
thanks for the outstanding content my
question is about form hypertrophy
training
the rp guide recommends flexure
exercises is training extensors
like with the expand your hand rubber
bands also worthwhile brian so brian's
interesting question
that a lot of folks ask um
so there's like my tendency to be a
sarcastic piece of shit from being jaded
from the years of instagram
and then there's my actual sort of uh
we're all human beings answer i'll give
you that first
you can't absolutely train your
extensors um you have to
real creative on how to train them
because it's very difficult to train
them because
you think about unrolling your fingers
how do you even resist that yeah the
rubber bands
how do you periodize that how do you
progress that uh how do you
get novelty out of that um so first of
all
you can do it it's tough second of all
it's not some it's not these aren't
muscles that grow very very big
and if they're gonna be big on you
they're probably gonna be pretty goddamn
big from just
normal training and holding on to stuff
and if they're not pretty big doing that
they're just not going to get much
bigger uh the analogous uh situation
here and actually the analogous
functional group in
quadrupedal animals is the tibialis
anterior it's really just a
really similar muscle uh and the
tibialis interior in front of the calf
just basically doesn't do shit
as far as hypertrophy just doesn't get
that much bigger and
training it looks hilarious again has
the same problem of like novelty and
there's only really one exercise to do
for it um and it just won't make a hilly
beans difference in your look
some people get some much bigger
extensors and if you want to do some
reverse curls
you want to do some rope pulling you
want to do some kind of work with bands
i think that's okay
uh almost no one does it for hypertrophy
training and
the people that do it it's just not
clear that the forums get that much
bigger
so that that's sort of my take on it so
yeah theoretically will ad size is it
worth it
uh you know um and he also says is it
also worthwhile
that's a call you're going to make i
would say if you're really interested in
bigger extensors
try training them plenty with whatever
modality you can and see if they really
improve and if you give it two or three
months and you're like dude i can't even
tell i'm training these shits
just fucking stop doing it because it's
taking away what i'd like to call like
psychological mrv
you know you can only train hard on so
much and if you're like just extensive
day you know or like you know
at the end of like a really productive
session that's what i was gonna say yes
you get to the end of the session and
you're like cav time and you're like
fuck
same thing like extensor time why bother
exactly yeah i think there's therapeutic
values
for some people in training the
extensors it seems like uh people who
um do a lot of like hand work or typing
and stuff like that seem to get some
kind of therapeutic benefit out of
training those a little bit more but
from a hypertrophy bodybuilding
standpoint the payout
versus the time spent training it just
seems to be very weak so i would say
probably not the best use of your time
unless you want to have this part of
your
arm look really cool maybe it does some
people get really fucking cool like
veiny forms on the top here and
yeah that's awesome i don't but a lot of
those guys start with like if they just
do curls
it just happens anyway yeah exactly yeah
um all right
geraco delta what
d-r-a-k-o oh it's right there
sweet yes yes
ganacho says i have 60 pounds to lose so
be doing a few maintenance phases along
the way
i know you said it's nearly possible to
build muscle and maintenance it's not
nearly impossible
it's just a pretty constrained um
compared to building muscle on a mass
phase
um but is there anything i could do to
build some during this journey
uh so you can turn your maintenance
phases into into
i don't like the term mini mask because
it doesn't exist but really really slow
masses
so let's say you lose 20 pounds in your
first fat loss phase
take one to two months of just
maintenance after that
try to just add a little bit of a
surplus to gain like
five pounds over the next three months
it's not much but you'll gain some
muscle
um and then take a little short two week
active rest or a little to two week
maintenance
and then do another 15 pounds of fat
loss one or two months of maintenance
after that to really stabilize your set
point because you're going to want to go
back up
usually we say for for most folks mass
as soon as you're done cutting
for you it'll just be a shitload of food
you'll balloon up 10 pounds
after because 60 pounds is a lot to lose
so maintain first then another mass
phase of five pounds blah blah blah
so as you can see good luck with the
trade-off here is that like
you start every next cutting phase five
pounds heavier than you otherwise would
be
but three pounds more muscular every
time right so at the end of your 60
pound fat loss journey
you may have a crew 10 pounds of muscle
whereas in the in the sort of
counterfactual when you didn't do that
you could have accrued two pounds of
muscle or no muscle at all
and it will take longer it will take
longer to lose the weight
and you won't lose as much weight so
it's all trade-offs all the time uh give
it some thought to see which way you
want to go james
yeah really good answer and graco like i
mean this with the utmost respect so
please don't think i'm coming after you
fuck you but i you know given what you
said
if you have 60 pounds to lose i think
it's fair to say that
when you start doing your hypertrophy
training for your cuts
you are very likely going to be
recomping along the way that would be my
guess
most people who have 60 pounds to lose
generally are starting at a relatively
kind of low training state or early
training age i'm
going to assume that that you will
probably going to fall into that
category
and think that you will likely recomp
along the way now maybe that's not you
and sorry if it's not but i'm guessing
given your situation
you're probably going to gain a bit of
muscle just from doing the hypertrophy
training during your cut and then you
compare that with mike's advice along
the way and make your uh
make your maintenance phases a little
more bang for your buck in that regard
yeah yeah all right
nicolas luca ricciardi
ricciardi so spicy got it
very how necessary is cable slash
dumbbell fly for a big chest
or is pushing movements like bench
enough so
um for a big chest almost everyone
benching is enough okay but inevitably
folks will misinterpret that last
statement and say well i got a bigger
chest doing flies
yeah well now your chest is extra big
not just regular big
okay because we see power lifters who
rarely if ever do flies
have big chests we know that pressing is
a big enough chest for most people now
if you're not most people you may need
isolation work
to get your biggest chest ever you'll
probably need isolation work because
the stimulus to fatigue ratio of enough
pressing ends up going south on you
and your shoulder joints and elbow
joints just won't tolerate the requisite
volume you can put into your chest
that you could do with a combination of
pressing
and flying movements so unless you're
allergic to flies or you just don't have
access to the equipment
you should do them for the best possible
results
and wherever you want to stop your chest
growth you can stop it there
like i'm joking this is sarcasm
only a little tiny grain of truth to it
but oh i don't really understand why the
fuck people ask shit like this and i've
asked them shit like this before
because it's like are you like allergic
to dumbbell flies you can't fly some
shit like
you got a problem doing that shit like
like
you just got a mission to only grow
chest with barbells or the dumbbell
supplies not sufficiently hardcore
um it's kind of like asking you know hey
can i have a really really tasty
junk food meal without any chips or
french fries it's like
yeah i guess but like you're already
eating junk food like
eat the chips and fries they make it
better i promise in most cases it's just
going to be tastier like why would you
cut that
are you allergic to carbs what's going
on so nicholas if you have a good reason
to avoid these things like you just
don't have the equipment or something
which strains credulity because
you have dumbbells maybe it just has a
barbell at home
you can get a great big chest totally if
you want your best chest
some dumbbells and cable flies are
probably going to need to be included
and if you're genetically an outlier
and pressing really just is something
that your front delts and triceps take
over on even a big chest
may require flying uh for you so there's
that
yeah i agree with dr mike here so like
you know your bench bench and your
pressing variations are going to be your
big
raw stimulus exercises for chest for
sure
but the nice thing about the fly
variations whether they're dumbbells or
cables or
even machine pec deck kind of stuff is
the sfr tends to be really good because
there's not as much systemic spill over
there's not as much like tricep
dealt spill over like you really just
can isolate the chest
and fucking get after it in whatever rep
range that you want to get after it in
so
the sfr now granted it's going to be
different for everybody
but generally speaking it's a great
choice for adding chest volume
whereas you can only add so much chest
volume from pressing before other things
start to fall
apart like your wrists your elbows your
delts shoulders all that stuff so
you can kind of look at them in two
different ways and not just like
say like which one's better it's like
okay well if i want a just a gnarly
massive stimulus build a big chest like
bench is definitely a good place to
start and then when i need to kind of
fill some holes in my chest training
because i have
more gas in the tank but i just can't
press any more then i can look at my fly
variations and go from there
all right the last question for the day
believe it or not this is going to be
number 10
oh spicy sounds like a viking stepping
off how do you say i
i have no idea even where to start help
me out omkar
ah got it anyway
omkarana asks should a this is actually
a question we'll probably answer another
600 times
it's in the docket to make a youtube
video on this we'll probably get a
trillion views because everyone wants to
know
should a skinny fat person 15 to 20 body
fat cut or maintain first how much of a
weekly weight loss would you recommend
so uh i'll answer this in two parts and
see james if james can
clean up anything i don't answer so well
three parts part one do not mass
um why because you could gain muscle
more efficiently
at a lower percent body fat but that's
not the big reason because you can still
gain lots of muscle when you're fat
the big reason is that you'll just hate
how you look
yeah it's like a sort of standard like
knock against a very mindless reading of
ripping toe
is that like everyone who's skinny fat
starts starting strength and they're
told to drink a gallon of milk and eat a
bunch of cookies and all of a sudden
they're
much stronger much bigger but much
fatter and they're like why the fuck did
i do this to myself so
because most people tend to not like
that we would say
that masking is off the table now the
following gets to be more of a specific
answer
the best approach for most skinny fat
people when they start training
the best approach from a long-term
optimality perspective if you put
psychology aside just for a second
is to maintain first and then cut why
because you can get great recomp as a
skinny fat person
for months and months and months when
you start eating relatively like a
normal person
um or rather rather the other way around
eating like someone who cares about body
composition
and training hard and that way you can
make tons of great gains
and you don't have to just cut your
gains right off by going into the
deficit
once you've sort of milked out your noob
gains for anywhere between
several months to a year uh if not
longer of training
once your sort of straight starts to
plateau a little bit you notice body
comp's not changing a lot anymore
then do a fat loss phase and check this
out you won't be 15 to 20
anymore if that's where you started
because the recom will take you
something like 10 to 15
and then you do a cut and then you're
close to 10 and then holy fuck like
you're you do standard periodization
after that go between 10 and 15 all the
time
so that really is the emphasis if james
and i can help it we usually try to get
skinny fat people to resist trying to
cut right away
because they really can build some
really great name and stuff and also a
lot of times when you just start
training
the cognitive overload of also starting
a restrictive diet yeah it could be a
lot
and it you don't get as strong it
doesn't pump you up you're like yeah my
gains are okay but what's like you're
fucking dieting of course you're not
gonna be okay
try to maintain first then cut if you
wanna cut right away though for the soul
if you just can't be fat anymore you can
cut
and then the recommended advice is to
cut relatively not quickly because
you just don't you don't you want to
still conserve an anabolic stimulus to
some extent
but you don't want to rush people into a
diet they're probably their first diet
so i would say what percent weekly
weight loss i would say no more than
half a percent a week so if you weigh
200 pounds just go for a pound a week of
loss
you get through 12 weeks like that you
lose 12 pounds of
fat shit you might lose 14 to 16 pounds
of fat and gain a couple pounds of
muscle because you are skinny fat and a
noob
and that's a great great result
especially if this comes after several
months
of maintaining and recomping at the end
of that man you're making some awesome
gains
and you made your easiest gains instead
of rushing right into a fat loss phase
james yeah really good so like when you
have like for me when we get clients
you know you have somebody and they're
like i want to start you're like what do
you want to do and they're like i don't
really know should i do this or that
i would say nine times out of ten you
usually will lean towards cutting
because most people will be very
enthused
to get leaner right and that's all like
getting heavier is always hit or miss
getting leaner is almost always a hit
the problem is when you have these
skinny fat people
right you get them leaner
and there's nothing underneath and
they're like where's my abs like you
don't have any they're like what do you
mean like what did you think you had
under there you have no muscle
like you never trained before you have
no biceps no chest no abs no
nothing and so that can be very
disheartening as well
so i i know most people have been there
before right where you lost
you know maybe maybe you weren't
overweight but you lost some weight
thinking you were going to look really
ripped at the end and you just
aren't that ripped and then you realize
like oh i actually need to gain some
muscle here to look more ripped
most of us go through that that's fine
so when you have the skinny fat person
just be cognizant of that you might
actually do more
harm than good by getting them lean
right away because they put a lot of
effort into cutting and
it's rigorous it's hard right and they
get to the end and they're like i don't
feel like i look that good and you're
like yeah you don't
you look like shit yeah and you know
that actually just real quick
uh james and i have to run in just a sec
but
i think it's worth and this is all good
trainers
all mediocre trainers and coaches should
be and
are of course doing this talk with your
client about time courses
ideas of what they want to look like
eventually and how much effort they're
willing to put in and how much time
delay
they're willing to put forth to look
like what they want to look like you
know
um because like look there's a lot of
clients who legitimately
just want to fucking lose 15 pounds they
want to do it in the next couple months
because either going to puerto vallarta
mexico at the end of december
and they just fucking nigga i'm not
trying to be phil heath here
i'm not trying to have a lifetime
transformation whatever just get me
fucking leaner
so i can go get married and not look
like a fat piece shit totally
that's reasonable not everyone's in it
for the super long haul and maybe
eventually they will be but they're just
starting out not
so for those people of course you'd
start them in a fat loss phase
but then you got a great conversation
where they come to understand what's
going on you're like
you're not going to be much more
muscular you're going to be much leaner
which i'm not going to look like
superman under there like you're going
to look a little skinnier
and if they're like yeah totally that's
all i want i would fucking have a tuxedo
to fit into
you're fucking golden but then other
folks which again
always have this conversation be like
here's the deal like what do you want
long-term if they tell you look like
i don't really care in the short term in
the long term i just like want to be one
of those guys
who comes to the gym and people like wow
he's like really jacked and lean
if you're like in that position then of
course you you want to tell them look we
probably start maintenance could a good
solid base of muscle burn a little fat
no weight loss yet then eventually when
you get a little bit more solid
um then we can start a little bit of a
fat loss phase get you cleaned up and
then start on the mascot mascot mascot
uh type of shit to get you more jack and
then they know that
they signed up for it so when like six
months down the line they haven't lost
any weight
but they look much better they're not
going to be like what the fuck am i
paying you for because imagine taking
the tuxedo guy
and doing that with him without a
conversation he's about to have a
wedding in two weeks i haven't lost any
weight in
in three months you know yeah but you're
recompening really well he's like what
the fuck is recomping people can't tell
in a tuxedo you're like
huh i should have had that conversation
with the guy so always make sure you
know where your clients are coming from
i know once this sort of negotiation
sometimes james like you said
sometimes they don't know sometimes they
don't know and then you have to talk
them through it and
lay off options and trade-offs like we
can do this we can do that
here are the trade-offs here's what this
is going to cost there are no right
answers no wrong answers
i just want to make sure that whatever
answer you choose
you get the right tools for the job and
the right expectation like if you're
going on a mystical quest you got two
doors
one you know is a you know uh super
fiery
quest the other is a super icy quest our
job is to give you a fucking
you know a flamethrower for one and a
warm coat for the other
our job is just to give you the right
thing for the right quest there's no
right answers but
you don't want to as people be like i
want the fire shit you throw them in the
cold with a fucking flamethrower
like okay this isn't helping anyone so
that's the deal
yeah totally totally cool
all right folks that's all we have this
week your questions answered
