hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
again today's topic is going to be about
how long your workouts should be or
really can be
at the very top end what's too long to
work out and we'll of course answer the
question
of uh you know maybe what's too short to
work out as well so
we're going to come at this from
multiple perspectives we're going to
talk about workouts for strength
we're going to talk about workouts for
hypertrophy we're going to talk about
workouts
for fat loss cardio like if you step on
the treadmill and try to lose some fat
uh through a session what's the longest
you should be on that thing
sports cardio like you're training for
triathlon and you have like a whatever
10 mile run what's too long
and sport practice let's say you're
doing wrestling or jiu jitsu or
gymnastics or whatever basketball
football
what's the longest practice should be
and what's the point at which it's like
probably a good idea to just go home
rest and maybe do another session
instead of just keeping going in one
session at a time so
first we can look at the most
theoretical
very top-end answers of what's for sure
too long
to do at any one time in one session so
for strength
you can hypothetically in some
circumstances continue to strength train
in a single session
until your performance falls below the
strength intensity threshold
like once the weights are too light
you're actually not training for
strength anymore
you're probably training for more like
hypertrophy or just getting tired the
weights just aren't challenging anymore
it's time to stop there are other
reasons we're going to stop sooner than
that we'll get to that in just a sec but
just
to outline the basics here for
hypertrophy
we train or can train until the latest
the target muscles are no longer the
limiting factors in our working sets
right because if you are so tired
centrally you just can't
give enough oomph to your muscles you're
probably done and the target muscles are
no longer what you're training you're
just training systemic resilience at
that point just being tough for
something like that
fat loss cardio has a bit more of a
nuanced cut off
it's when the stimulus to fatigue ratio
of calorie burning
becomes unacceptably low we'll get into
what that means in just a second
basically when the cardio tires you out
so much that it'd be better to just come
in
fresher and do another session later
we'll of course put
real world values to these things we'll
actually give you times we're just going
to talk pure theory
for sport cardio triathlon training or
something like that
it can be up until the performance falls
below
what is your target threshold for that
endurance training at the time
so if you're saying i'm gonna keep a
seven uh minute per mile pace
and all of a sudden you've trained so
long that you can't do that anymore
you can't you're not training to your
goals anymore not training hard enough
to get the sport adaptations you want
so it's time to cut it off and lastly
for sport practice
up until your technique is no longer
crisp because if you practice bad
technique fatigued
you learn bad technique you essentially
reinforce that technique
and then you become worse at technique
which is really really bad sport
practice is largely about technique
anyway
we'll talk about exactly when that point
seems to happen and how to detect it so
without further ado
let's move into strength okay
fundamentally you can train for strength
in one session until performance falls
below strength intensity threshold
what does that mean well for
intermediates and advanced folks because
beginners gain strength
lifting like thirty percent of the
winter max this usually means anything
below 75
1rm confers much less strength gain per
set
than anything above 75 percent one ram
so if you're training 80
one ram 775 75 percent on a rem and
you're doing quality sets again
you may very well be gaining strength if
you're training like 70
on a ram 65 60 one rm you may be
conferring other benefits such as
hypertrophy or something work capacity
or endurance
but you're probably not gaining a whole
lot of strength and if you're pretty
advanced any at all and if you're
actually very advanced you could be
regressing in strength
doing too much volume of that really
really light stuff now
the way we apply this rule is usually
you could hypothesize like okay so if i
can do still do a single at seventy-five
percent one rm
then i can still keep going i guess
technically by that metric you can
but we don't train with singles for
basic strength we train with
normal sets um you know in your target
rep range the target rep range for
strength is usually the three to six
range we can also use for example the
five to eight range to build like some
strength and hypertrophy at the same
time
so whatever your rep range is if you can
no longer do working sets in your target
rep range
at 75 percent one rm or heavier you're
no longer training for
strength so for example if your squat
1rm is 400 pounds
okay 75 of that is 300 pounds and if you
can't do
sets of like three to six or sets of
five to eight
with 300 pounds then you're for sure
done okay so then you're for sure just
not training for strength right however
however more than likely our workouts
are going to be cut
much shorter than that this is the very
very theoretical top end a lot of people
will reach other
caps which we say it's time to leave
before that
for example the most common next cap
is you're doing so much volume in this
session even though technically speaking
it's above the
strength threshold that you're creating
an excessive amount of fatigue that's
going to
interfere with your next session because
remember if you do squats on monday
and front squats on thursday for
strength yeah you can do a crap ton of
squats on monday
what if you do so many that your front
squats on thursday suffer you're still
sore you still beat up your nervous
system still messed up
you just have a dog ship performance you
want two high quality workouts you don't
want one over the top workout in one
workout that sucks
so a big concern there is to do
enough volume to stimulate gains but not
so much that your next workout sucks you
want to stop it at some point
to make sure you recover in time to have
your next workout be good
so tldr depending on the setup you're
using
the realistic top end for the number of
sets you're going to do
per workout okay not per muscle group
it's much smaller per muscle group
but total strength workout is usually
because remember these sets are hardcore
they're tough they're technically
demanding they're heavy you're not going
to be able to do an infinity of them
like you do for hypertrophy
hypothetically right
it's usually between 10 and 20 total
work sets
is the top end that doesn't mean all of
your workouts should have 10 to 20 work
sets a lot of them will have fewer than
10
but if you're anything above 20 work
sets and a strength workout
i start to suspect you're doing some
weird stuff towards the end it has
nothing to do with strength
it's needlessly fatiguing you it's
certainly not strength training now if
you have a strength workout
and after it you have a hypertrophy
workout in the same session yeah you can
do some more work there's some
interference effects with that we have
other advanced videos covering that
that's fundamentally okay but if our
strengths work sets of
three to eight reps roughly or two to
eight reps
you don't want to do any more than 10 to
20 total works that's split amongst
various parts of your body that means
even if you squat bench and deadlift on
the same workout
any more than 10 20 total working sets
of all those movements and and the
muscles that use them
is way too much for strength work that
usually under most normal circumstances
should take no longer than two hours
which means
maybe you'll get better and be having
excellent results training more than two
hours at a time for strength
but you should be skeptical if you're
training for more than two hours at a
time and if i see you training for more
than two hours at a time you
tell me that you're training for
strength i'm gonna be skeptical
that you're not uh organizing your
training efficiently
and that you're taking too much time or
doing too much volume so the two hour
cap
is a real world which means what someone
says like hey my power lifting workouts
when should i have a shake during them
and i'll be like well you don't have to
have a shake
you could if it's longer than an hour
how long do you work out you're like
what's three and a half hours
i'll be like what the hell are you doing
for three and a half hours it starts the
aunt towards the end of that
you're not training strength i don't
care what you say or
or you are training strength entire time
but you spend like
five minutes talking to the girl on the
cardio machine six minutes like
looking at your knee wraps or something
like that then you're just wasting time
so if you're working efficiently you're
taking just enough rest as you need
anything more than two hours is probably
overkill
hypertrophy is actually super simple so
let's move on to hypertrophy
hypertrophy can be trained until the
target muscles are no longer the
limiting factors in work sites
okay and you can stop way earlier for a
bunch of other reasons specifically
recovery
for not doing too much in the session
and being able to be ready to do good
high quality work in the next session to
recover but
top end is your muscles are no longer
the limiting factors which means
that if you have a pretty well practiced
mind muscle connection you can actually
feel
when this happens right like you're
doing bench press bench press bench
press
and your pecs and packs and pecs are
getting more and more pumped and you're
feeling it
and then at some point you're gonna do a
set of bench and you're gonna close
close to failure and you're gonna rack
and someone's like oh man did like your
muscles start to cramp and you couldn't
do it anymore like honestly man
i'm just so tired that i can't even get
my muscles to fire super hard
like it's just i'm just done i'm spent i
feel centrally limited right when you
feel like
your soul has been taken from your body
and all of you have trained harder
virtually training you know exactly what
i'm talking about like
someone's like you know at the end of a
really long leg workout someone's at
your quads right they're done
you could be like yes also but there's i
can't train anything after that
i can't train my quads after that i
can't train my hamstrings i'm done from
a central systemic perspective if that's
the case
your muscle can't be taken close to
local failure which means the quality of
every set is going to suck suck suck
which means you should be gone
and potentially just come back in
another session the skeptical limit on
this
is two hours if you tell me you're in
hypertrophy session and longer than two
hours i'm starting to really really
question
how high quality the later sets are the
later sets are probably junk volume
which is to say they're probably limited
much more by your central systemic
ability
to squeeze something out versus your
muscles actually getting close to
failure and getting their best
hypertrophic benefit
fat loss cardio okay this is cardio you
do not to get better at sport not to run
the mile faster
but just to burn fat okay tons of people
do it all the time
when you stop your cardio session can be
up until the stimulus to fatigue ratio
of calorie burning becomes unacceptably
low okay
stimulus to fatigation for cal burning
is really simple you
stimulate calorie burning just based on
your pace and the modality
so you're on the elliptical at 130 beats
per minute it just burns a certain
number of calories per minute so that's
your stimulus easy it's the easiest
stimulus ever decades
uh to calculate it's also completely
objective yeah you're not like ooh do
i'm feeling my bicep or like
am i doing 140 beats per minute yes do i
still weigh 190 pounds yes
i'm burning a certain number of calories
the machine tells me right however
the stimulus side is easy to calculate
but the bottom the denominator fatigue
side
is also really straightforward but is a
little bit more perceptive
fatigue is like you know you could be on
the elliptical like when you start on
the elliptical you usually feel like oh
this sucks but after five or six minutes
you're like oh man like
i'm starting to get my groove you got
your jams in you're staring at people in
the gym trying to
work on your mean face and all of a
sudden 30 uh 40 minutes pass and you're
grooving
towards the end you're gonna start to
feel like you're really really dragging
now look
if you still keep up the same pace you
still burn the same number of calories
right your stimulus side is really still
good
right but your fatigue side starts to
get higher and higher and higher which
means your stimulus to fatigue ratio
starts to suck suck suck
you're burning these calories and you're
paying an incrementally higher and
higher fatigue cost
every minute that you're on the machine
maybe it's best after a while
for you to get off the machine go home
rehydrate etc
take a rest have a meal and then maybe
come back the next day and do cardio so
people say like should i do cardio
monday wednesday friday
maybe but maybe if it's getting too long
each session and you're really dragging
towards the end
maybe doing cardio six days a week
monday through saturday and half the
time is best
how is it best it's better stimulus
fatigue ratio so over the course of the
week you burn the same number of
calories but you pay a smaller fatigue
cost
in the context of a fat loss diet the
less fatigue you can have the better
especially with muscle retention
and keeping up your lifting performance
so technically
you can just keep going with cardio
until you fall but fatigue exponentially
gets higher
okay so generally speaking there's going
to be in every cardio session you're
going to feel like crap in the beginning
which is totally fine you're not like oh
my sfr sucks let me get off of here
you're going to feel pretty good towards
the middle once you get your your groove
going
and then towards the end you're going to
have a systemically based
drag like usually the reason people stop
with cardio especially if they're in
decent shape
is the systemic uh rate limiting step in
your brain literally tells you like ah
we're done here man
and it's not because your muscles are
cramping or anything like that right
so it's okay to push through that tail
end
towards the bit you know you don't want
to just stop when you feel good
it's okay to feel that drag a little bit
and sometimes you got a goal and you
gotta hit it you only have so many
cardio sessions per week but you don't
want to be deep into that suck
okay you don't want to be like 30
minutes into the worst time of your life
and you're just incrementally adding
tons and tons of fatigue
if you say yeah willpower bro take that
willpower put a little duffel bag
and bring it back to the gym later that
day or another day get the same amount
of cardio over
the course of the week just spread into
more sessions that's how all good
athletes train is multiple sessions a
week
so what's the skeptical cutoff for you
guys at home just on just
raw numbers anything over about an hour
per session at roughly 120 to 140 beats
per minute which is a really good fat
loss cardio
uh heart rate anyway anything over about
an hour
man you just do another session people
post on instagram like two hours of
cardio like
good god right and it's fine right it's
fine but that
second hour pays a nasty fatigue cost
one hour of cardio not super fatiguing
burns tons of fat and you just do more
of those sessions
six sessions a week you're well on your
way and to be completely honest with you
guys
unless you're tracking steps and you're
getting your activity throughout the day
any more than like one hour of cardio
six days a week
if you do any more cardio than that for
fat loss purposes bodybuilding purposes
you probably should just lower more of
your calories instead because then at
that point you're becoming an endurance
athlete
and less of a bodybuilder all right so
give that some thought all right
second to last i think yeah is sport
cardio
okay this is cardiovascular exercise
performance exercise
designed to enhance your abilities at
your sport which often is a
cardiovascular sport
right so it's cardio training it's
either done for endurance sport or
a sport like maybe like rugby or
something which endurance is a factor
how do we know when to stop we can keep
going until the performance of the
cardio
falls below the threshold of intensity
that we're targeting for our endurance
training right
the good news is is your program and or
hopefully your coach
should have those numbers distinctly
defined for you as
what is the intensity we want almost
every if not every
cardio program for triathlon marathon
five thousand ten thousand so on and so
forth
any kind of swimming and any kind of
sport practice almost
all that cardio is gonna come with a
pace right they give you a pace
once you cannot maintain that pace and
until unless you get the prescribed
distance
you're no longer training for sport okay
if someone says your coach says okay we
need a seven minute mile pace
for for as many miles as you can go they
never say that but they said let's say
eight miles and they say maybe you'll
make it eight miles maybe not
if you fall below that pace you're no
longer training to that pace you're not
training in the exact way your coach
wants
for you to get really really good at
that sport because nobody gives a flying
fuck
excuse my language uh if you run a
marathon and succeed like
congratulations
you're not you're a participant that's
really great marathons are tough
if you're an athlete in the sport of
marathon
what matters is can you cross the finish
line at a certain time with a certain
pace and if you're not training to that
it doesn't matter
it's like someone who wants to squat 800
pounds squatting 200 pounds just for
more reps he's like hey i'm still
summing up the total right guys i'm
still crossing the finish line
what that's never you're never going to
squat 800 pounds if you just do 200
pounds just the same way
endurance training cardio training is
not about finishing and doing the work
it's about doing the work at the base if
you can no longer do the pace
folks it's time to cut off the session
and usually the coaches will cut off the
session way more in advance than that
right
but that's to minimize fatigue to keep
performance high but if you don't know
you're not super sure anytime the pace
falls below what you need
you're done right you're super done
there's no skeptical cutoff here
because some of the training can be a
very low pace could be for hours people
go on the cycle
uh they go they go on the bike they they
swim they run
uh for hours and hours hours on end and
that's totally fine as long as you're
hitting your pace but if you're not
hitting your pace
you're done so if you're having a really
really bad day off day and you tell your
coach like coach i can't keep up a six
minute mile pace
usually they'd be like all right finish
up do a little cool down
go home sleep a ton eat a ton relax and
we're going to wrap your intensity back
up
later this week as you recover that's it
all right lastly
sport practice this means actually
practicing practicing your sport
playing basketball playing football
wrestling jiu jitsu all this other stuff
how long do you maintain sport practice
and by the way this actually goes for
weightlifting when you're doing snatches
and cleaning jerks
okay because that's technically sport
practice so sport practice should almost
certainly stop
when technique is no longer crisp okay
now here's the thing that's when you do
sport practice at some point you get so
tired
that you're making obvious and annoying
mistakes
like stuff you shouldn't be doing when
you're like dude i feel like i have
butter fingers
what the hell is going on you're in a
crappy position all the time
here's the thing it's okay because we
all have moments like that every now and
again especially when we're learning a
new technique no big deal
so give yourself another round or
another set or another whatever another
little time slot
to see if it's a fluke because sometimes
you you raise
your bar again and you're good to go and
you're just grooving and moving and
doing great technique no big deal it
wasn't
it wasn't fatigue but if you give
yourself another round of things
and you're still doing some of the
following it might be a good idea to
shut the session down and just come back
in another time for example
making such mistakes still making more
such mistakes
okay so you weren't grabbing the
person's thigh and wrestling like you
were supposed to be yourself forgetting
okay when i shut down i grabbed the
thigh
and not only were you not grabbing the
thigh now you're just grabbing the knee
and your coach is like dude what you're
really you're you you messed up the last
three shots what are you doing you're
making more mistakes than before not a
good sign
you feel subjectively tired in addition
to that because if you feel fresh and
you're grooving with your sucking
technique
sometimes it's a rusty day no big deal
you don't have to quit but if you're
missing the positions you're supposed to
be or everything feels off groove
and you're also like oh i'm super
exhausted physically gee you is you know
the
fatigue is probably contributing to that
decline in technical ability
if you have all those things it's
probably best to cut yourself off
right technique learning is a very very
hampered
by fatigue because then you're learning
the techniques wrong
so the rationale to keep going in sport
is the worst of
all of these applications if you just
keep going and strengthen the intensity
is barely there
you might get some extra gains
hypertrophy maybe some extra gains
endurance shit your endurance might even
get better
if you continue to practice with
incrementally crappier and crappier
technique
you can get worse at your sport and you
almost certainly won't get better
the trick to getting really good at
sports is multiple sessions of a
relatively short frequency or sorry
relatively short duration
higher frequency that's how you get to
an advanced level okay
you look at the guys that go to jiu
jitsu worlds they don't train
for two hours at a time twice a week
nobody does that
they train 12 times a week for 30 or 20
minutes here and there doing high level
rolls
that's how they train that's how you get
to be the best so
tldr the goal of training
of all training is to have high quality
workouts that confer the best results
with the lowest price of fatigue
right by whatever measure you're using
if the quality of the workout has
degraded substantially and you know it
it's probably best to stop the workout
in the gym
that usually means anything about over
two hours should definitely raise some
eyebrows okay
if you really need to train for that
much longer you should probably
just come in and do more sessions so
people ask like hey
and this doesn't answer that question
directly when should i switch from a 4x
a week split to a 5x a week split
one of the answers there are other
answers could be
well can you get all your training done
in like an hour and a half and like nah
it's pushing two hours
probably better to do five sessions
right in hypertrophy training for
optimality
when any of your sessions exceed much
over an hour
or like for legs or something an hour
and a half after you're done warming up
into the hard stuff
splitting it's probably a good idea
right so people say like why does this
guy train quads by itself
by themselves and not quads and hams
because if you do quads and amps
together it'd be two and a half hours
because that's how long it takes to warm
up for 675 pounds stiff legged deadlift
or something right so super jack guys
sometimes split their muscle groups up a
lot because they can only do due
diligence
that's tough to say for one or two
muscle groups at a time and then they
just run out of time
they run out of systemic abilities and
then systemically they're more limited
than they are locally right
now once you accomplish your training
goal for the day you can leave
and people all we addressed was the top
end here we didn't address the bottom
end it's because the bottom end doesn't
exist
there is no such thing as too short of a
workout if you
have time to warm up and you get
whatever you have a goal for the day
you can leave if that takes you 35
minutes sweet see ya
now you may be planning your workouts in
a way that's arbitrarily too small
but as long as it's not too much you can
fill up all that workout time up to an
hour hour and a half or whatever
if it's not too much on any of these uh
sort of check marks
then you're going to condense your
workout so you can say like should i be
doing
six hypertrophy workouts a week i can
ask you a question can you get
all your high quality work done high
quality work done
in four sessions you'd be like yes be
like then six sessions a week would just
be you come to the gym more often if you
want to do that sweet
it'll confer slight advantage maybe but
probably not worth it for you sitting in
traffic and yelling at people out of
your car
an extra two days of the week when you
can get the work done in four but if you
can't
it's time to do more sessions right the
goal is never
to just do more for its own sake people
say
dumb ass shit like always be the first
to be to enter
the gym and the last to leave what the
fuck what are you doing in there
being a person that enters the gym on a
fucking mission
gets amazing training when that training
degrades leaves
plots his revenge and comes back later
that day
or the next day be a person who
frequents the gym often
for high quality workouts and is aware
of their recovery and is doing the right
shit
then you become a dangerous motherfucker
not just by showing up to the gym early
and
twiddling your thumbs and working out
way too hard and getting worse
and then waiting until that last guy
stops drilling and leaves the gym
there's no cop
nobody's watching the gym guys i mean
you know your gym owner could have like
a secret hidden camera somewhere i
wouldn't know anything about that
personally from many lawsuits many moons
ago but
nobody gives a shit how long you're at
the gym are you there to do quality
and when the quality degrades do you
leave and do you go recover and do you
come back when it's time to train again
that's the only thing that matters
and if you need more sessions add more
sessions don't just add duration folks
hopefully you find that sort of
interesting if you have any questions
about how to install a secret camera in
your gym
uh go ahead and shoot them my way i
would have some expertise on that folks
before i incriminate myself further see
you next time
you
