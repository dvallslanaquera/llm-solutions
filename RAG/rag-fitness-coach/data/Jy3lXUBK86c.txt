hey folks
lecture four for nutritional approaches
to muscle gain
this time ranges of weight gain
and durations of weight gain to make
sure we're on the right track for
gaining the most muscle and hopefully
the
not greatest amount of fat so what are
we going to talk about today
we're going to talk about first of all
answering the question of why waking is
important for muscle gain
because a lot of people say well i want
to gain muscle but i don't want to gain
weight
can be valid in some circumstances not
valid in others
we'll explore that we're going to talk
about in great depth how progress is
actually measured like how do you know
that you're probably gaining muscle
right versus just spinning your wheels
muscle gains cool word there's a cool
phrase to say and you can say that what
you're doing is muscle gain but you
might not be and how do we know well by
measuring we'll figure out how
we're going to talk about the potential
problems of gaining too slowly as well
as the problems of gaining too quickly
so we're going to set a nice middle
range there we're going to find out what
that range is
and then that's going to be reflected in
our discussion of best gain rates then
we're going to talk about the problems
of gaining for too short of a length of
time
like if you say i'm going to muscle gain
phase and you gain for a day and then
you start cutting
you're clearly that's too short we'll
talk about other situations that are too
short as well
gaining for too long and what the
downsides there can result in
and of course we'll end with best gain
durations so kind of give a good
sort of rubric a working guide of you
know what is an appropriate
amount of time to dedicate oneself to
the muscle gain process
before switching gears all right first
up
why is weight gain important for muscle
gain
in other words why can't we just
maintain the same weight and just aim
for quality gains i just want lean
tissue i don't want to get huge
well we actually can and you can gain
some muscle
by uh gaining no weight at all and even
losing fat during the process to such an
extent that you lose weight or losing
just enough fat and gaining
the concomitantly similar equal amount
of muscle
that leads to a stability of weight so
for example could be 170 pounds
20 body fat and months or years later
you can be 170 pounds
and 15 or 10 body fat that means you
have more muscle less fat it's possible
but it's not very reliable especially
for individuals that have been training
for quite some time
relatively advanced they're already
pretty lean what we mean by reliable
is that you want to give yourself the
best chances
for muscle growth and sometimes under
not so great conditions
we don't actually get much or any muscle
growth unless we give ourselves the best
chances
right so if you stay at 170 pounds
and you do everything you can to gain
muscle except gaining weight after
months and months of work
is sometimes it's not really clear if
you gain muscle or not uh and that's an
awful waste of months and months why
don't you give yourself the advantage
gain some weight so you can be almost
sure you've gained some muscle certainly
give yourself
the best opportunity so we mean by
reliable as if someone comes up to you
and they said look i've been training
for five years pretty hard i've been
dying really well
only 170 pounds and i want to gain
muscle for sure
do you think i should just maintain my
weight and just train and eat
it would not be a factual to say that
you could reliably do that so your
advice to them would be like i wouldn't
count on for sure gaining muscle like
it's possible but a certain way condom
and look if you're gaining muscle and
it's important to you you kind of want
to do something reliable
it makes a little bit of sense and even
if it's reliable
it's not the optimal way to go so if you
even if you can guarantee someone
that's relatively untrained or maybe uh
hasn't done a formal diet before
or is a very high body fat percent as on
their way down you can almost guarantee
that they're going to gain muscle so
it's reliable
but it's not optimal they could gain
more muscle if they gain weight at the
same time and we'll talk about why
right so there's kind of a soft limit
and a hard limit
for maintaining the same weight and
trying to uh gain muscle while losing
fat at the same
time the soft limit is this
recomposition is a lot slower and harder
than just net gains
right when you're recomping when you're
trying to gain muscle
and lose fat at the same time remember
there's a myriad of strategies
for losing fat and there's a myriad of
strategies for gaining muscle a lot of
strategies completely contradictory for
example weapon number one so long as
you're eating enough protein
of gaining muscle is a hyper caloric
diet eating more calories than you need
weapon number one by a long shot of
losing fat is a hypo caloric diet now
how the hell are you supposed to do both
those the same time
if you try that it's iso caloric and
it's not good for either one
right it's like someone's like okay do
you guys want to do like do you want to
play
uh you know uh paintball or basketball
and someone's like
oh how about both like that would just
be a really crappy game where you get
shot in the face
with a paintball gun when you're trying
to shoot hoops maybe i just invented the
next greatest game
and i'm just gonna eat my words but
probably not some things are just better
left alone
and recomposition kind of makes two
things that are
much better alone fight each other
particularly hypo and hypercaloric
dieting right
so if you do want to recomposition the
sort of soft limit there on gains this
is just not the fastest way to do things
it's just a lot harder now
a lot harder for intermediates for
advanced people it could be
damn near impossible and you certainly
don't want to set yourself up for
impossibilities
now the harder limit is this you can
recomp
at 15 body fat if you're female at 20
if you're male for sure at 20 and
everything above you can almost
certainly because you have lots of
excess fat and your body's not so
worried about getting rid of it like it
gives it up pretty easily
that you could potentially gain muscle
and lose fat at the same time
when your fat dips to below 10 percent
for meals and 15 percent for females or
thereabouts
your body gets real real concerned about
your body fat and holding on to as much
of it as possible
that is when you want to employ a
hypocaloric diet
to give that added boost to fat loss
because without a hypochloric diet
you're probably not going to lose a
whole lot of fat
or anything at all no matter what you do
with your nutrient timing your macros or
anything like that
if you're already at 10 or 15 for
females so the hard limit is this
if you want to recomp let's say you get
to 170 pounds you want to be jacked
you get to 170 pounds and you're now at
9
body fat or 14 if you're a female how
much muscle you're going to add
your body's not giving up any more fat
which means you're not going to add any
weight for muscle if it's not losing any
more fat how are you going to gain
muscle you have to gain that weight what
if you say oh i'm not getting that
weight you're just going to go nowhere
so at some point this process breaks
down and if you really want to put on
more muscle you have to gain weight at
some point right
now a lot of folks think you know i'm
too fat to be gaining weight you'll get
females that are 26
body fat and they'll say i'm not going
to go on a gain phase look how fat i
already am
where the heck am i going to go with
this gain phase i'm just going to
balloon up and it's going to be crazy
the thing is a muscle gain phase needs
to be hypercaloric for optimum results
but nobody said hypercaloric means you
you iv oreos into yourself and gain a
pound a day
a really reasonable mass gain can be as
easy as gaining five pounds
over three months time look you gain
five pounds of tissue
over three months you don't look super
different your belt stuff doesn't fit
differently
when does when do clothes start fitting
differently when do you start looking
differently
to different people uh that see you man
you know 10 pounds 15 pounds for sure
five pounds is barely anything you know
that's really you're just really not
going to be that much fatter
and and maybe just a couple pounds of
that will be fat the rest will be muscle
so there's not a ton to worry about i
think a lot of people when you say hey
weight gain
is really a good thing with my with with
muscle gain they say oh my god weight
gain then they're like 140 pound you
know uh crossfit or female and they're
like weight gain and the first image
that comes to mind is like 450 pound
like jabba the hut like eating princess
leia
right this is not exactly what happens
you know you go from 140 to 145 over
three months you gain yourself plenty of
muscle and nobody even noticed
that you even got you know remotely
fatter because by percent you barely did
so
this doesn't mean extremes but some
weight should probably be gained for
best results
all right measuring progress
here's the deal how do we measure
progress how do we know
if we're gaining muscle and so gaining
weight and specifically gaining muscle
there's a couple of ways one and
probably one of the most important is
body weight
multiple trackings of body weight per
week are best
two or more up to seven is fine but you
know if you have like three or four
you're
cancelling a lot of the noise out you
take those averages per week so you take
three or four body weight measurements
per week or even seven you average them
that's your weekly average
the next week you do the same thing you
take a weekly average
if your weekly average is going up
you're gaining weight and because you're
gaining weight under a situation where
you're hopefully
training logically and your nutrition is
good and you're getting plenty of rest
then you're probably gaining some muscle
now the degree of muscle gain is going
to depend on your genetics your training
age so on and so forth
but more or less you're doing something
right you're definitely headed in the
right direction
second one your repetitions you're
getting on your lifts
or keeping repetitions constant how
strong are you for example
let's say your best set of squats is 200
pounds for 10 reps
if months later you're squatting 220 for
10 reps or if months later you're
squatting 200
for 13 or 14 reps with the same level of
effort let's say to failure or something
like that
then that improvement is a sign that
something got better now
if it's a new exercise or if it's a
compound movement especially which you
haven't done in a while
nervous system alterations can make
strength gains and endurance gains for
you and exercise
so it's a little harder to tell if
that's muscle if that's the nervous
system technique so on and so forth
but uh generally speaking if you've done
the movements a while
it's not probably neural learning and at
least some of that muscle mass
is going to be uh oh sorry some of that
strength gain is going to be related to
that muscle mass it's going to be
indicative of muscle mass
in addition to that over long term years
there's just stuff you can't do with
neural alterations
you don't go from squatting 315 for sets
of 10 to squatting 365 for sets of 10
because you learn how to squat better
but you probably knew how to squat
pretty well by the time you were hitting
315.
365 for ten you just plain old have to
have bigger legs i mean the muscle just
doesn't come
or the strength it doesn't come from the
magic nervous system theory or something
like that
a way to obviate this technical thing
there's two ways two good ones
one use exercises that you do really
really frequently sort of all the time
squats bench presses deadlifts pull ups
bent rows you might never really remove
them from your program or or use very
close variations but never get away from
from the basic moves and if you're using
those and doing those
man if they're going up it's probably
not because you're getting better at an
early you do something for three years
your nervous system improvements are
very very small
most of the improvements are going to
come from muscle size right makes makes
very good sense
another way to obviate this technical
problem is to focus
in your training on compound heavy
basics with some isolations
but use the isolations more to measure
so for example
how much neural efficiency are you going
to be able to make on a leg press
on a hack squat on a machine chest press
where you're pinned in and the range of
motion is predetermined
there's just really nowhere to go it
really has been shown
that isolation more isolation moves and
not necessarily even isolation but more
machine moves that restrict your
uh your motion and your technique like
what's your tack squat techniques damn
near the same all the time after the
first
six or eight weeks you pretty much have
your technique down if you use those
machines
that's a pretty good way to tell that
you're gaining muscle so nervous system
wise you could get
really good oh i have a virus and threat
protection windows defender summary
isn't that nice thanks windows
don't take that out sky you can just
leave that in people need to know about
viruses
so if you know your low bar squat can go
up by
you know 50 pounds potentially in
several months just because you figured
out the technique really well
but once you have the hack squat down
that kind of only goes up if your legs
get bigger
right and and that's a good way to use
that stuff
point number three mirror appearance and
clothes fit
so if you look more jacked in the mirror
you might be more jacked and especially
if you're honest with yourself or even
if you're like
a little pessimistic like when you start
to notice that your traps look pretty
different yeah they're probably bigger
right and it's really possible to track
things in the mirror it's
quite subjective but if you've been
doing it for long enough you can at
least say
use the following test if you really
just don't look
any different in the mirror you can say
okay i can't be sure that i gain muscle
right because you don't want to cut
yourself slack and be like oh i gained
muscle because i maybe could look a
little different
but if it's staring you in the face like
oh my god what happened to my pecs like
why are they so big
you probably gain muscles probably not a
light trick
another one and of course you never use
mirror by itself and we'll get to that
in a second
another one is close fit like if you for
the first time ever
got up to 180 pounds from weighing 160
your belt
went up like one inch and your waist on
your shirts and stuff and your
are fitting pretty normally but like you
can't fit your pants around your glutes
and your quads
and your chest is like busting buttons
open on your collared shirts
yeah you probably put on some muscle on
the other hand
if your arms don't feel any tighter if
your legs don't feel any tighter
but it's getting three or four belt
notches up from where you used to be
maybe you gained quite a bit more fat
quite a bit less muscle it's subjective
but it adds to the picture and the
adding to the picture
is a really big part of this
what about formal body composition
measurement devices
can use dexas bod pods skin folds bias
ba bioelectrical impedance analysis uh
is okay to use in
statistical trials and research
populations large groups of athletes
for the same person over time it's
largely an appropriate measure because
the
error rate is like really kind of
nonsensical if you take a bia
twice a week the entire year you might
actually be able to get some good
reliability data
so that if the but it's going to give
you a body fat you can see if it but
it's going up or going down and that'll
be accurate
the actual body fat itself especially
for people that are very muscular and
lean such as yourself
it's more or less a make-believe number
how many belief is it a lot of bias have
a button you process athlete
or non-athlete it gives you like 10
differences in body fat what the hell is
that
that's not clearly not measuring
anything that actually you know directly
is accurately impinging on whether or
not your whatever muscle or whatever fat
so a huge grain of salt for baa but it's
fine if you use it all the time and take
it
all year round skin folds a really good
skin fold practitioner can give you a
real general range of what you're at but
i'll put it to you this way there's a
three or four percent margin of error
for good skinfold practitioners
which means what if you gained three
percent
muscle which is ungodly amount of muscle
that's huge
gain it took you six months the skin
full could say that's all error and
could say you didn't change at all
so how often should you skin fold
yourself man i don't know if you have a
really good practitioner
once a month could give you real general
trends but what i'll say in a bit is all
this other stuff
is is going to make up for that and make
it very clear where the skin fold just
adds data you don't even need at that
point bod pod
is okay not super duper accurate better
than skin folds dexa is very accurate
but the level of accuracy and precision
it has doesn't
is does not have the power uh yet to
track over weeks of muscle or even
months of muscle
or few months what i would do is i would
get a dexa
once or twice a year if i had access to
one bod same thing but dexa's preferred
when you do a dexa once or twice a year
you can track long-term changes in
muscle and fat here's the thing take
them at the same time in every phase
if it's at the end of a fat loss phase
once take it the next time at the end of
a fat loss phase because body water and
stuff have huge effects on dexa results
if you take it at the end of the same
kind of phase or you know once or twice
a year you get a pretty good picture
remember the dexa results taken with a
grain of salt because sometimes the
error is going to be
either making you think that you're
superman you know you'll lose 10 pounds
on a fat loss face and gain 2 pounds of
muscle
unlikely right and then the next time
you gain 10 pounds on a muscle gain
phase and it says you only gain 2 pounds
of tissue
of muscle and you're super disappointed
it says you lost muscle i've seen that
before
so take it with a grain of salt here's
how i would use
uh these measures so i would focus over
the weeks
on body weight and rep lifts is your
body weight going up within the ranges
and we'll talk about what those
are are your rep lifts going up or lifts
on your you know your
compound movements and your isolations
are you getting stronger
for reps if that is doing well over
weeks you're doing great
on mirror appearance and close fit just
keep an eye on that over the course of
you know multiple months three months
uh you know sort of take uh sort of okay
my clothes are fitting pretty well
and a little tighter in the arms and
chest and back and not so much in the
waist then you're good to go
and then yearly for dexa's and bod pod
skin folds bi is to be really careful
with that stuff
i wish i had better news for you guys to
be honest we've got to cut you the real
deal here in rp plus so
um i wish there was a really good body
fat assessment device there probably uh
will be in the future but currently
unless you can you know a really good
one actually you probably take once a
week as mri
now the if you can afford a thousand
dollars a week and afford to
the i'm sure at a hospital if you just
came up with cash and be like i hit my
head again i need a full body mri
somebody some some doctor might be able
to do that for you it just costs a lot
to run the device
so unlikely you know that's if i'm ever
a trillionaire i'm just going to get an
mri machine at home and
just scan my limbs after each meal it'd
be really sweet so
here's the deal folks any one of these
by themselves
does not give you the whole picture if
you use all of them especially the first
three
and they're all consistent they all
point in the same direction
that's good data so for example if your
body weight is going up
if you're getting stronger for reps and
your mirror appearances you're looking
more jacked
not too much fatter and you're closer
fitting like a more jacked person's
you're almost certainly gaining muscle
on the other hand
if some of them are discordant then i
just wouldn't be super confident keep
doing what you're doing
but maybe play with the approach a
little bit double and triple check your
approach to make sure you're doing some
good stuff for example
your body weight is going up but your
rep lifts are like and you're kind of
getting a little bit of fat in the waist
and not in a whole lot of other places
as far as gaining a circumference and
girth
for either your mirror appearance or
your clothes fit are you gonna you know
if
you were to ask me like hey am i gaining
muscle like i really like to see
your your your strength for reps go up
um that's probably one of the better
ones and i just without it i can't
i don't know it could just be you're
gaining fat right or if you're getting
stronger and your mirror appearance is
looking good but you're not gaining body
weight
man you know where's that muscle going
you know he's supposed to be gaining it
where is it really so if all of the
three top things align and of course
especially if the fourth body
composition analysis
if all of them align you're golden if
they're discordant
give it some thought if all of them say
you're not doing so well you're almost
certainly not gaining muscle so
that's how i would interpret that now
let's say we're trying to gain
we talked about weight gain being an
important factor
and all right so uh well weight gain is
good but
what if we gain super super slowly let's
say we're really afraid of fat gains
what are some problems with that
and remember the purpose of this
discussion is to eventually get us into
normal rate ranges
to pick logical weight ranges that are
very effective we have to essentially
refute very slow gains and very fast
gains
and how we refute them will constrain us
to a certain effective range
so if we decide to gain super duper slow
what are the problems with that and
super duper slow we're defining as a
very clear definition
less than a quarter percent 0.25 percent
of body weight per week
right that means if i am 200 pounds and
i gain
less than half a pound per week uh
what am i risking there remember half a
pound's okay 0.25 is okay less than that
significantly less what's the problem
there first
is the weight tracking problem
how do you track one pound per month
how in the hell is that possible i've
seen recommendations out there you can
gain a pound you should be gaining a
pound per month
a pound per month here's the real big
problem
with that you could have a caloric
intake
and a balance of energy expenditure that
results in a one pound per month weight
gain
but you would be blind to the
directionality
or the question of that weight gain for
months
until your weight averages exited
the zone of just off probability and
fluctuation here's what i mean
you keep your calories constant but you
eat some salty food your weight's three
pounds up the next day
you go to the amusement park with your
friends your calories are great
everything's fine you ain't normally but
you get a little dehydrated in your
pound your weight is six pounds down
from that high one three pounds down
from the average
weight calibrates right all the time
and it it is never constant and it goes
up and down up and down up and down
so that's what we call noise in a
statistical analysis
and the only way we can conclude that
you're getting actual weight gain
is once that weight gain exceeds
at least the band of statistical noise
because if it doesn't we can't say
you're probably gaining weight because
it could just all be noise
so for example if we're getting a pound
a month let's say we start in august
and then in september first we look at
our weight averages and on average
it looked like we weighed you know 150
pounds all right sweet
then september and on average it looks
like we weigh 151 pounds like okay
that's cool like i guess we're on track
october comes around and it turns out
you know
the reason that we're weighing so much
is it was because it was really humid or
something like that to september
as we sort of drink more water and
because it wasn't as dry we didn't expel
more of sweat
and just a couple of weeks that on
average led us to retain just a little
bit more water
right we started a new allergy
medication and just retained a little
bit more water there's about 500 000
things
that can make your weight on average a
pound heavier because it's
pointless to even count them all in
october our
weight average is 149 pounds so
what the fuck for lack of a better term
have we been doing for
three months now we've been telling
people that we've been gaining weight
we've been telling ourselves we've been
gaining weight
we're on a muscle gain plan bro but
we've gained negative one pound
that's awful that's three months damn
near pissed away now were you training
hard of course
did you probably gain some lean tissue
just from training hard of course but
you're basically doing a recomposition
diet
we just can't be sure right is there
theoretically a problem with
gaining that slow yes there is we'll
talk about it later but probably the
bigger problem is you can't even tell if
you're gaining
when can you tell if you're gaining well
at least three months and uh you know
up in isla you should be up three pounds
and if you're not then probably you're
not going fast enough well
geez three months pissed away i don't
know about you guys but i'd like to know
if i'm pissing away time
after a few weeks not after a few months
right now
point number two is probably the most
more direct critique here actual muscle
gain is faster with faster rates
they've done multiple studies the more
you eat the faster your gain the more
muscle you gain problem you gain a whole
hell of a lot more fat too
but muscle gain is also there right and
it's higher the more food you eat up to
a point that's probably pretty high
like two percent per week which is
insane if you're not recommending that
but if you go these needless rates
people say man i just want to gain
you know like half a pound a month or
something you could just gain more
muscle
if you accepted a little bit of fat gain
and we'll talk about later how we can
just deal with the fat no problem
right so so that's a big deal actual
muscle gain is just literally going to
be faster
you're going to be telling yourself hey
i'm going slow it's on purpose your
buddies are going to be going around you
eating more food having more fun
eating bigger pr's and getting more
muscular and they're like yeah but
they're getting fatter
and then they do a six week mini cut get
rid of all their fat and they're way
ahead of you the months ahead of you and
you're like damn why the hell am i going
so slow
right it's almost like being worried
about speed on the freeway getting hurt
in a car accident
and only ever going 15 miles an hour
look you know
the probability of a fatal crash doesn't
really start until
30 45 miles an hour so if you're going
15 miles an hour just to be super safe
you could go 30 miles an hour and be
basically just a safe from anything
serious happening to you
is there an argument against going 90
for sure but if you're doing 15 and
everyone's doing 30 that's really not
really much of a defense there
right here's the deal really really
buttressing point number two
fat gain is faster too when you gain
faster than 0.25 a week
but fat can be lost much easier than
muscle is gained
you can lose 0.75 percent of body weight
in fat in
pure fat every single week for six weeks
straight without hardly risking muscle
at all people do this
all the time it's routine right as a
matter of fact if you just check the
major boxes
losing a lot of muscle during a fat loss
phase is really actually quite difficult
right in the sense that it's just not
very likely
so there's a low risk to muscle loss
there you can lose a ton of fat so
here's the deal
if you go a little bit faster right
then 0.25 per week while you're gaining
weight and then you just take a couple
of weeks to get rid of the
the fat then you're back to square one
with four pounds of muscle on you at the
exact time that a slower gainer is only
up to two percent
uh muscle or two you know uh you're up
to four pounds of muscle
they're at two pounds of muscle you're
two pounds of muscle ahead of them
and they're say but but but you're
fatter and you're like no actually i'm
not fatter as a matter of fact i'm
leaner than you now because i cut off
all the fat that i gained
in that short window of time so it's
basically like
if you have if someone tells you hey
listen i don't ever work
more than six hours a day or more than
four hours a day more than four hours a
day
because i work every day and i'll just
accumulate way too much fatigue and just
lose my mind if i work more than that
you say hey you know what if you worked
eight hours a day but you took two days
off
every every week and you fully let the
fatigue come back and then you could
grind again for eight hours a day
you're like i never really thought of
that i guess you'd get a lot more work
done oh yeah no shit but that's why we
have weekends right
there's a reason that pulsatile phasic
behavior is advantageous you get the
best of both worlds
right if it works like that and it does
in muscle gain for sure
so when people say hey you shouldn't be
gaining that fast you're getting fatter
it's okay to a point because you can
lose the fat no problem
fat loss is easier than muscle gain by a
long shot so we have to integrate that
into our approach
right in other words point number four
gain faster lose fat and repeat is a
better process
than just super slow gait we don't have
to be needlessly afraid of gaining
because we can always lose the fat
is there a point at which there's too
much of a good thing absolutely and
we're going to talk about that next
so problems with gaining too fast
clearly we've made a hell of a case that
gaining too slow is probably a bad idea
what about gaining too fast let's say we
just decide to get huge
just monstrous what's going to go on
there what do we define as too fat well
our range is pretty narrow here more
than half a percent of body weight per
week
so basically if you weigh 200 pounds
right and you're trying to gain more
than about a pound a week let's say two
pounds a week
two pounds a week takes a lot of eating
by the way that's a uh
if memory serves roughly thousand pound
a thousand calorie surplus
every day that's gnarly right so let's
say you decide to go that route what are
some of the downsides well
the first thing is that for at least a
couple of weeks you get a huge
food volume and this gnarly mega bloat
that can mask the tracking process
when i'm really pushing my body weight
even with half a percent per week
i get like a five pound perma bloat from
just eating that much food and that much
water in the gi tract plus food when i
switch from mass gain to maintenance i
just drop five pounds
automatically none of its tissue is just
bloat a lot of its gi bloat subcutaneous
bloat from just stuffing yourself with
that much
food right so if you decide to go real
fast
for weeks on end you can't tell what's
bloat and what's actual tissue gain
so you'll be like oh it's okay i'm up
ten pounds in two weeks but that's just
bloat maybe it's
a lot of bloat maybe it's a lot of fat
so we can't quite tell tracking problem
much worse problem is number two as you
gain faster and faster especially beyond
point five percent body weight per week
the fractional increase in body fat just
goes and nuts
so like if you know a normal conditions
intermediate with good genetics good
setup
they can gain roughly in some cases
fifty percent muscle and fifty percent
fat you have half and half that's not
terrible right it's a lot of muscle
if you go one percent 1.5 body weight
per week we can see ratios
of like eight to one nine to one fat to
muscle holy crap like folks fat is
easier to get rid of the muscle but not
on a ten to 1 ratio
and as a matter of fact if you gain you
know 20 pounds of fat and two pounds of
muscle or three pounds of muscle
20 pounds of fats a lot to lose you
might actually lose most if not all the
muscle on the way down right which i
think is an independent
uh problem we get here so
basically yeah the ratio works but
if you skew to really really high rates
the ratio starts to not work in your
favor you gain tons of fat
and not enough muscle to justify that
fat gain either on timeline basis health
basis you name it
definitely appearance basis it's tough
to tell your friends your bodybuilder
when you're 30
body fat right so
you definitely gain more muscle right
but the ratio is off so that's point
number three
and and here's the thing here's the
worst part as you add more and more body
fat
your p ratio what's called your
partitioning ratio is how many of your
calories
and nutrients go to muscle versus fat
gets worse and worse and worse we have
good reason to believe that so if at 10
body fat
you could get you know from 10 to 15
body fat you could gain a decent amount
of muscle and not so much fat
15 body fat to 20 body fat as you keep
going and gaining super fast
your fat gain skyrockets and your muscle
gain
actually starts to decline a little bit
you still gain muscle but not as has
faster rates
so it's not just that the majority of
gains are fat from the get-go
with a super super high surplus it's the
longer you do that surplus the worse the
ratio is
that's real real real bad news right we
don't want to do anything like that
here's another addition as you get mega
fat because if you want to do this and
it's going to work you got to do it for
months
as your body fat really gets out of
control your training performance
suffers
right good luck doing sets of 15 in the
squat when you're super out of shape
i've been there it's awful your hormones
start to misbehave particularly natural
testosterone secretion
still occurs just fine you have plenty
of testosterone when you have a high
body fat
but your conversion of testosterone to
estrogen increases
pretty much linearly with how much body
fat you have so you started out
having a lot of tests and not a ton of
estrogen great environment for muscle
gain
at the end of that process when you're
super duper fat you're producing a ton
of estrogen
which is good for strength gains
actually pretty decent for muscle gains
but is a sort of positive uh feedback
loop for more and more fat gains
bad deal bad deal for sure your health
is being degraded
right so if you get super fat all the
time on muscle gain phases you're just
you're literally
you're you're paying the piper the
entire time or you're taking months off
your life every time you're doing one of
those phases not an exaggeration
you do decades of those phases you've
taken years off your life no debate
whatsoever
and in addition there's an inflammatory
effect of high body fat
the higher body fat the higher systemic
inflammation
not terrible thing but it probably
doesn't go super well with recovery
with injury management and even with
hypertrophy you want to keep your
systemic inflammation your chronic
inflammation relatively low
and use pulsatile inflammation around
the training process that goes south
when you gain super fat so i probably
made a pretty decent case
getting out of hand fat it's not neutral
so people say like oh
i do the oreos and milk diet when i gain
weight and i gain a shitload of strength
i don't give a fuck about being fat
because i don't give a shit i want to be
huge
like that's all good and well but you
know there's not a neutrality there
that's not like oh but just if you can
psychologically handle the fat you'll be
fine well no if it's a ton of fat it has
all these other physiological effects
which are not bad only for muscle gain
and performance but other parts of your
life and your life particularly is how
long it's going to be
right lastly and i mentioned this
earlier you're going to have to do a
mega diet
or multiple diets at some point to get
leaner again to reset all those things
so you can gain productive muscle right
because you can't super be fat forever
you probably want to look jacked at some
point and not just like a balloon
and even if you know you're okay looking
like a balloon just to stimulate more
muscle gain you probably want to get
leaner it's going to take a long time to
get leaner
a high fatiguing long diet that's
probably going to risk some of that
added muscle
so basically you put on weight so fast
and so much fat that now you have to cut
so much
fat in order to get back to lean that
you might risk the very muscle you put
on
boy is that shooting yourself in the
foot real real look back to you
right moderate gain rates are better for
all of these respects
right they're absolutely better so that
takes us into the following discussion
of what are the best gain rates
right so you can gain slower than
a quarter percent of body fat or sorry
40 of body weight per week you can do it
but you'll have to explain why right so
if someone tells you hey i'm getting
really
slow your first question shouldn't be
like oh like
you know how are you doing it or
something you should be like why are you
getting that slow and not faster right
then they're gonna have to give you a
pretty good answer
and you can gain faster than half a
percent
right uh it and and there are situations
in which you can if you're really
like ranked beginner amazing genetics
something like that
um but you'll have to explain why right
you can't just be like oh well there's
just because normally i just do this
it's not normal it's not usually
going to work so you're going to have to
have some really good reasons for it
right
and here's where we get into the
specific recommendations individuals
prone to rapid muscle gains
with minimal fat gains fuck all of you
wherever the hell you are
cheating bastards right you can start
closer to half a percent
per week why because you're going to get
a lot of muscle you don't usually gain a
lot of fat why would you pit her around
at the low end when you could have
high-end gains totally
and the thing is i just insulted all of
us because almost all of us are prone to
rapid muscle gains or minimal fat gains
when we start lifting
and we start scientific dieting for the
first time so beginners
probably closer to half a percent it's
pointless to start
training and lifting and if unless
you're like you know super super duper
high body fat
you can probably gain at pretty
aggressive rates now
those who gain muscle relatively easily
but gain fat easily as well probably
want to start closer to 0.25
why because they gain muscle relatively
easily they don't need the big boost
of half a percent to really potentiate
muscle gain with a real hypercaloric
diet right
they'll gain muscle no problem but
because they gain fat relatively easily
they want to be easy on the weight gain
because it's going to cause a lot of fat
gain so 0.25
is probably a good recommendation for
them so what if you're option number
three
you're someone who doesn't gain fat
easily or muscle easily that probably
means
that you're a relatively skinny person
right a hard gainer so to speak
and for folks like that because they
have trouble
gaining muscle they need some more oomph
some hyper caloric oomph
we say oh but hold on they're going to
gain a lot of fat well they don't gain
fat easily either right skinny people
don't get super fatties living neither
so somebody who's relatively skinny and
doesn't you know gain muscle super
easily they probably need to start
closer to that point five percent
a little bit on the higher end now for
folks who struggle with both
and you know it's unfortunate and all
advanced people struggle with both
folks that gain muscle relatively slowly
and gain fat
relatively quickly right you probably
want to split the difference and go
middle of the road
because either one of the extremes is
going to cost you a little bit too much
if you're an advanced individual if you
struggle with both if you go super slow
you
just might get a whole lot of muscle out
of the process if you go super fast you
get super super duper fat
split the difference for a start and
then find your own own individual best
results from there on
right all right
duration time what is the problem of
gaining for too short of a time let's
say you only gain
for about a month and then you're like
oh my god i'm getting super fat or
you're like damn i got a ton of muscle
let's start a fat loss phase what are
the problems there
well there's a concept of a settling
point
okay and a settling point is very
similar to a set point but it's a little
bit more malleable it basically
is the body weight that your body likes
to settle at
usually it's regulated by activity and
kind of hunger cues like if you just eat
whatever however you're hungry you're
not stuffing yourself
and if you're active like you normally
are where does your body weight settle
here's the deal
if you don't gain enough weight for your
body's settling point to rise
significantly
a lot of the muscle you gain might just
not be very permanent your body's just
going to go back down to whatever weight
it used to weigh and not much changes
all right there's a part of weight gain
that is intentionally disruptive of
homeostasis
it's taking your body outside if it's
pulling it outside
of its normal settling point and
dragging it up higher
to click it into place to a higher
weight a higher muscle mass that sticks
the way to do that is to go up high
enough and the only way to go up high
enough short of just
eating oreos every day and getting super
fat and over a month is to go
multiple months and really not just get
your weight up
higher but keep your weight up higher
and get it up higher over a long time to
really convince your body it belongs
up there right if you don't you might
just shrink back to the same size over a
couple weeks
jesus i feel like i didn't even do
anything right
if you only gained for a month
especially if you go at the low rates
you might not even confirm
that you gained any weight but if you go
at a low rate of gains but you gain for
six months then i mean even with a low
rate of gains you're gonna confirm that
your body weight has gone up
but even at a pretty fast rate of gain a
month geez that's like two pounds maybe
four pounds that could all be body water
glycogen shift water shift etc you want
to be sure that your gain
actually worked you don't want to work
on it so little that you're like i think
i think it was a good month but i'd have
to do another month to be sure and
just do another month right so it could
just be not enough time to even see if
we had a working process
point number three very very interesting
stuff some new literature coming out
uh on this um there is probably a little
bit of a difference at least
between actual gains of contractile
tissue or fully functioning muscle
with more sarcomeres etc and actin and
myosin and everything
versus what are called preparatory gains
which could in part be
more gains of the actual volume of the
muscle more gains
in in the sarcoplasm itself right the
sort of the fluid of the muscle itself
maybe some more gains of titan nebula
and other connective tissue proteins
that sort of work as you know in our
skyscraper analogy for the building
that maybe work as the frame of the
building you can gain a frame in a month
you probably can't fill the frame in
with actual you know printers and
computers and walls and plumbing and so
on and so forth that probably takes
longer
there's some really interesting data
that after multiple weeks of gaining
even months
uh the actual contractile tissue didn't
seem to go up yet and this is
in people who are training with weights
and intentionally trying to gain muscle
so
there's uh you know this stuff may pan
out in the future as one way or another
but to give ourselves the extra edge we
don't want to find out in
five years that the first two months of
any gain process is only just
preparatory gains or the first month
and that if we stop and go back that
just preparatory stuff just goes away
and we never capitalize on it so
we might not actually have a lot of
contractile which is probably very true
for beginners
more than advanced individuals but
potentially there's some variants there
as well
i just wouldn't bet on a month or less
of muscle gain quote unquote even if you
look bigger because the cells have
swelled
to be real lasting muscle growth at
least for that reason itself
here's another one exercise selection
whether or not you pick the moves that
work for you to put on muscle size
whether or not your technique has stable
to one that allows you to overload and
one that allows you to track
and if you're building momentum where
you're overloading getting stronger
overloading getting stronger overloading
getting stronger and constantly
producing really really good effects for
muscle gain
that takes time right you're gonna find
moves that fit you're gonna stabilize
your technique and just
really begin to overload and then after
a month you stop gaining mass and switch
gears
you're really just catching that
momentum it's kind of like trying to
learn a foreign language
for a month and then leaving the country
and going to another country you might
as well stick around for six months or
so and learn stuff that actually sticks
versus switching so fast that as soon as
you start feeling the groove
you're ending the process so for all
those reasons it's probably a really
really good idea
to gain for longer than a month right
and sort of to that point
people that stop really soon you know if
you're gaining good muscle and you can
potentially gain more why stop so soon
right
if muscle gain is a serious priority
maybe you can give it two or three
months maybe you can give it four months
right why is there this rush to just do
it for a month and then stop we know
it's not going to be a lot of size
anyway
and if the going is good let's keep
getting it
now that logic only goes so far what if
we're gaining for too
long what are the problems there game
for too long we're going to define
as more than six months for especially a
non-beginner i think beginners can
probably gain for like a year
and be totally fine but six months for
an intermediate and advanced
there might be some problems there
here's the deal
proper gaining requires not just
nutritionally gaining
but training to gain which means as we
reviewed earlier in the introductory
lecture
training at above minimum effect of
volume consistently and somewhere
between mev and mrv maximum recoverable
volume
which means that you're going to be
training hard fundamentally in
relatively high volumes that's the way
you gain muscle
your body can't do that for longer than
six months it's going to need a break
it's going to need an iso caloric
maintenance phase and you can't gain
during one of those because you're just
by definition gaining pure body fat
because you're not
doing anything to gain muscle right so
people say i want to gain for 12
months straight can you really train to
gain for 12 months straight the answer
is unless you're a beginner probably not
so you're going to need a break for at
least that reason
here's another one if you gain even at
the low end of rate
uh for six months straight you've gained
six percent body weight
and at the faster end twelve percent
body weight you probably got quite a bit
of body fat
to improve your partitioning ratio and
just to get leaner again so you look
like a lifter and you look like you like
you probably need another fat loss phase
then so you can say i'm going to gain
weight
for 12 months straight and that might be
some decent muscle there but your fat's
going to get pretty much out of hand
on that note worse p ratios the further
you go so for example
if you've gained for six months you gain
a certain amount of fat certain amount
of muscle
if you choose to go for another month
month seven month eight you're really
choosing
to gain very suboptimal levels of muscle
and very optimal so to speak levels of
fat you're just essentially planning to
gain fat at that point if you can live
with yourself
and if a little bit of muscle is worth
it to you fine or if the going's really
good on muscle gain fine if you're a
beginner fine
but if you're not those things man jeez
you're just kind of designing a program
to get super fat and not a lot of muscle
it's tempting to keep going sometimes
because your strength is still improving
but sometimes you gotta call it quits
right so all of those gain duration
problems they're pretty serious problems
so folks that are relatively advanced
probably don't recommend sequential
gaining
gain gain gain for longer than six
months at a time so where does that
leave us with
gain durations well gaining phases of
less than
one month long very speculative this is
by no means clear they work super well
and they definitely don't work the best
if you're a beginner i think it's
probably okay to gain for up to a year
at a time
right which is a hell of a lot of gains
but probably the only time you'll be
able to pull that off
for intermediates the cap isn't six
months or so
and for advanced individuals uh probably
six months or even shorter
or the results might not be so great
that doesn't mean that anything magical
is going to happen your results are
going to be met
and you could have got better results by
taking a maintenance phase reducing
fatigue
taking a fat loss phase getting rid of
the fat blank slate and then going up
and gaining more muscle again
right two month gains can work so
you say okay a month six months i'm
gonna gain for two months they can work
especially if that's the max you have as
an athlete with distinct competition
dates plans for example
let's say you're a power lifter and you
have a in a meet in six months
and your peaking face takes a month your
strength phase let's say takes three
months
that means four months are gone and you
only have two months for a hypertrophy
phase
would ideally you take four months for
hypertrophy yeah but you got a meat
coming up you can't do that
so two months is okay especially if it's
something you're constrained to maybe
it's not something we would design if we
didn't have that constraint but two
months is fine
right two months is fine the sweet spot
for most people in most situations
that aren't constrained by competition
dates is going to be three to five
months of continual gaining that's where
we get
real good momentum the real good stuff
anymo much more than five months can
work under some circumstances probably
not for the best in most cases
less than three months is definitely
totally cool but you probably get the
best gains
best momentum the best uh you know bang
for your buck if you really commit to
the process for three to five months now
that's three to ten percent weight gain
three to five months at the various
conditions that we can potentially have
0.25 to 0.5
it's no laughing matter right um
so you know that's a lot of weight
potentially
but here's the deal if you opt
for the high end of duration
five months you probably want to opt for
the slower rates
because you you don't want to gain a ton
of fat like ten percent body weight gain
even if three percent of that is muscle
which is amazing that's seven percent
body fat it's gonna change the way you
look it's going to change your health
for the worse
it's going to be a real difference and
it's going to be a hell of a time
working that off later that's not a mini
cut
that's a cut cut right and if you are on
the
short end of the stick if you're three
months of gain then maybe you can go on
the faster end
and gain a little bit more weight and
then cut it off later so
what this boils down to is five to six
percent
body weight shifts over a mass phase or
a muscle gain phase is probably kind of
the top end if you're gaining more than
five percent
of your body weight uh in a dedicated
massing phase
that's after body water suggestion so
folks coming off of bodybuilding shows
going from 160
to 190 pounds in six months if it's
totally fine because 20 pounds of that
was just body water at the front end
that's totally cool because you were
dehydrated as crap
that's fine but after you get into your
momentum to you know one or two weeks
after you start gaining
any more than five percent body weight
gain is probably something that's just
rushing the process is gonna result in
more fat for most folks i said six
percent body weight in the slides
seven eight is okay anything getting
closer to ten or above
probably needless probably not the best
idea
that's a lot of info in one presentation
unless
it's really bad info and then it's a lot
of really bad info in one presentation
folks next time i promise the info
at least be as good muscle gain
periodization
we hinted at it today right we hinted at
it in this lecture
that okay so gaining can only go on for
so long and it can only be structured in
a certain way and then we sort of said
well this is the maintenance phases you
might want to take and there's
definitely these fat loss phases
next time we examine what the structure
is going to look like switching from one
face to another
how to sequence them for best results
i'll see you then
