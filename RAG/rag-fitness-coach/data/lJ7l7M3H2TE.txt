hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization rp plus hypertrophy
concepts and tools
lecture number 25 how individualization
alters each of the other training
principles
we looked at the variables that
individualization affects the most in
the last lecture
this time it's on for principles
specificity overload fatigue management
stimulus recovery adaptation variation
and face potentiation
in that order how does individualization
alter the application of specificity
first is the needs analysis which is the
core of specificity is going to be very
different between individuals and
over time do should a person train their
pecs more
should they train their quads more do
they want their arms bigger or their
calves smaller
it's a thing that is going to be
different between individuals like
crazy alright so that's some big thing
to pay attention to
specifically very very altered in that
way by individualization
and then directing program design to
reflect priorities
is raw stimulus magnitude what you're
looking for best because you have
you know really to grow a lot of muscle
you really want to grow and you don't
have a big fatigue gap and you have all
the time in the world like an
undergraduate
lifting in college for the first time
during the summer semester
is it uh str that you really want you
know do you have a limited time to train
unless you have to smash
a lot of stimulus into a very limited
time or is it sfr are you someone who's
really heavily invested into this
you have time to train but your fatigue
is starting to be a cap because you're
getting stronger and bigger
those will be very individual questions
and they will alter the specificity of
your program based on how you design it
one last one is you know how many of
your activities compete with hypertrophy
program design for specificity for
someone who also plays
soccer five times a week is going to be
very different from someone who
just bodybuilds and that's it
overload individual differences
affecting the overload
principle application volume landmarks
are absolutely critical here
okay what is mev for someone might not
be me for someone else what is mrv for
someone might not be remotely very
stimulating for someone else
and they differ between different
muscles within the same individual
your biceps might need at least three
sets per session to grow
your hamstrings might need six sets per
session to grow and there's no telling
which one it is
only auto regulation can tell you that
and there's differences in the same
individual over time
used to be your pecs grew from 10 sets
of chest a week now you need 12 and then
later you need 15 sets of chest a week
to make noticeable gains
the same amount of training is not
always going to lead to robust gains
because
muscles adapt to that kind of stuff over
time as
long as you're in the 30 to 85 100 m
range volume is the main driver of
hypertrophy so there
has to be a lot of volume auto
regulation with that that can
really accommodate these overload
differences if you apply a certain
volume and it turns out individuals are
not getting a ton of stimulus they're
not getting a ton of fatigue
you can probably do more if they are
getting a ton of stimulus and a lot of
fatigue
probably doing the same or even less is
a good idea only throughout regulation
something like the set progression
algorithm from early lectures
is going to be able to tell you that
there's huge individual differences
there's no guarantee that was
overloading for one person is going to
be overloading for another
or for was overloading for one person
earlier is going to be overloading for
them
again later fatigue management
super straightforward volume landmarks
and keeping shy of our mrv
people have very different mrvs and what
is a volume that someone can survive
comfortably is a volume that will wreck
somebody else
huge thing to keep a luck out there and
applying fatigue management
another more intricate one is very
interesting is the ratio of
muscle versus joint connective tissue
recovery might be different in some
people some people have
muscles that recover very fast that is
like they don't even get sore
but their joints and connective tissues
don't so their muscles won't get sore
but joints and connective tissues after
a few
sessions of training get kind of beat up
it takes a while for them to recover
you might choose to do lower frequency
training for folks like that
some folks that have muscles that
recover very slowly but joints and
connective tissues that recover very
very quickly
so for them you might actually want to
limit how much you do
per session for the muscles but you can
use more hardcore movements
uh you know like that would stress the
joints more without fear of recovery you
might be able to pull off higher
frequency training
and of course you know for some folks
muscle and connective fissure recovery
occurs at a very similar time
scale and for those folks the training
program is much easier because you don't
have to worry about joint
connective tissues really really falling
off um
these might change over time right if
you are not super strong yet your
muscles aren't very big they can recover
very quickly but so can your joints
as you get bigger and stronger your
muscles can slow in their recovery but
not a ton
but your joints and connective tissues
because you're so much bigger and
stronger can really slow in recovery
and all of a sudden that ratio is
different which means and we'll get to
this in a bit
you might have to take different ratios
in your phases of accumulation to deload
you might have to do more active
recovery phases more maintenance phases
because your joints get beat up
more than they did relative to your
muscles
stimulus recovery adaptation training
frequencies
can differ radically between individuals
especially male to female
and larger to smaller females especially
smaller ones
neither disrupt their muscles a lot nor
their joints a lot with any given
session and thus they can do five or six
sessions a week for the same muscle
group and recover hunky-dory no problem
for months on end larger males
especially that have been training for a
long time might be in a position where
some muscles the quads the hamstrings
the chest
may only be trained really hard once a
week in an
easier one or other one or two other
times of the week because they can do no
more
than recover from that because the sra
curve is just
that long for them specifically on the
fatigue side
the way to do it properly is take a best
guess at what you think is gonna happen
so if you have a female client that's
100 pounds just you know three months
into her lifting and she hires you as a
coach
probably wouldn't train her once a week
per muscle group that's kind of stupid
but if you have an ib pro come to train
with you and he's already 260 pounds and
he's very fast twitch former collegiate
sprinter
you're not going to be like hey let's
put you on a six day a week split where
you train every single muscle
uh once a week or uh six times a week
that would be insane so take your first
best guess then
auto regulate frequency based on their
recovery with you give them a certain
amount of volume per session see when
they recover
certain amount procession see when they
recover and see how cluster the recovery
is keeping the muscle and joint
connective tissue ratio in mind because
their muscles could recover
with you know two days of rest but their
connective tissues might need
three days of rest to be better so more
sustainable program would have to take
that hit
and on average be lower frequency than
you may have wanted
next and this is sort of another
implication in the last lecture
different muscles within the same
individuals can be very different
people say you know how often you train
arms and how often do you train chest
and back
you may train chest and back twice a
week but you may train arms three times
a week because your arms recover so fast
and it could be vice versa people say
how often do you train legs well you may
train hamstrings double as often as you
train your quads or vice versa you may
train calves every day
but who the hell will train their quads
every day right there are differences
within the same individual between
muscles so don't just assume i'm going
to do
you know wait what frequency are you
running like 4x a week every muscle
group like that might not be the correct
answer to things
it might be that every muscle needs
something different and over time
frequencies per muscle within an
individual can change
it used to be that you trained your back
four times a week but now you've gotten
much better your fitness has increased
your technique your sfr
you're more intelligent with your
training your load management is better
now you can train it five times a week
and then later when you get much
stronger
the sessions are more disruptive
connective tissue takes a toll you're
back to four sessions a week so that can
change
sfr and detecting what's going on with
performance
and soreness and so on and so forth is a
huge huge role to play
in making sure you get the right best
guess
every other week on how much frequency
you're doing and for sure every other
mesocycle
variation uh
what are the best exercises which ones
someone asked me on instagram what are
the is there a list
of the best sfr exercises no and there
cannot be such a list
there can be a list of average
overpopulation best sfr exercises but
that's not very instructive if that
exercise just happens to suck for you
so there's a huge difference between
individuals over time yeah some
exercises are going to have crappier
sfrs you know the bosu ball
one leg peck extensions are stupid
shitty sfr
and then you know properly executed
deficit push-ups or really great sfr for
most people
it's super different within individuals
and over time
for example i used to get a ton out of
overhead
tricep extensions until my shoulders got
so big
that my elbows are pulled out i can't
physically pull my shit in anymore just
my pecs get in the way and everything
gets in the way
and all of a sudden that's not a great
safari exercise for me because while it
stimulates the triceps pretty well
although i lost range of motion because
my biceps got too big
not as well of stimulus and it's a super
awkward position and my joints hurt more
and i'm super uncomfortable and i have
to use a ton of weight overhead
we could be doing you know i've done
like 225 overhead tricep extensions
before for a set of 10.
uh lit the sfr and that is just not
great but it used to be like when i was
doing that with 115 pounds and i was
smaller i could bring my elbows in
it was the greatest exercise i've ever
used so things change over time
don't be like man i just don't feel pec
flies anymore what the hell is wrong
that it's okay try your best but if you
don't feel them switch to another
exercise you might
feel much better a lot of the reason not
all but the pros use
very different exercises sometimes
really weird setups you're like why is
that guy setting up that weird
you know one one arm row variation where
he could just do a normal one he might
not be able to because he's so big he
has to pull around his body
new variation is the only thing you can
actually do so
it can change over time sfr consistent
reanalysis of stimulus and fatigue ratio
is the only guarantee that you're going
to be doing a good job over time
don't assume that these are the good
variants these are the bad ones for
yourself or for everyone
and just keep going loading zone bias
some
uh folks are going to really like to
train much more heavy they're going to
get the best of
as far as heavy some folks moderate some
folks on the lighter end there's no
right answer there it's what's best for
you
and this can change over time as well a
lot of times
folks who are beginners will be
insufficiently strong to get a lot out
of very high rep
sets on the other hand folks that are
intermediate that we're getting a lot of
higher up sets but not lower upsets
develop a mind muscle connection and a
really really good technique
so that when they go back to lower up
heavier training they take that with
them
you know as an intermediate the lower up
sets you just like okay i'm moving point
a to point b
in these squats for sets of eight like
whatever my technique is fine i don't
have to feel anything but as an advanced
lifter
you may be so in touch with your muscles
in the biomechanics and the technique
and have such a great personal technique
that sets of eight are awesome for mind
muscle connection now they didn't used
to be
so these things can change over time
don't defy anything don't put any dogma
into it
always be on the lookout for slight
changes and slight alterations even in
your own training for how much of it is
heavy how much is moderate how much is
light
and this applies as well between
individuals and within
to exercise orders some people can start
with an isolation
go to a compound everything's great for
some other people it might just zap them
and it makes the compound go
not so well cadences some folks love
slow eccentric and some people think
it's a total fucking waste of time
like not think but feel that it's a
total waste of time and they may be very
well correct
some folks earlier in their careers
might not have liked slower centrics but
later in their careers developed a real
affinity for them because their sfrs are
better
and training modalities drop sets super
sense etc we already talked about in the
last lecture male versus female
uh females usually don't get a lot out
of drops out supersets etc but males do
but that can change over time
you may not have used to get a lot
gotten a lot out of supersets but now
you've mind muscle connection is better
your technique is better you've found
the right things to superset
two exercises you didn't think you
should superset you do and all of a
sudden it's a super golden zone
this stuff changes and is different
person to person to person
so when folks ask me for example what's
your favorite superset
sometimes i share that you know my
favorite tricep superset is xyz
but also say like it's not always my
favorite because it gets stale and also
it may not be your favorite so
really really good thing to look out for
lastly as far as the training principles
are concerned is face potentiation this
is a huge one
this slide and this super quick 30
seconds i'm about to do justice to it
may be one of the more important things
you ever hear as far as program design
uh on certainly on this channel on
youtube here it is
the mesocycle length
people say how long should a mezzo be
you know roughly four to eight weeks the
mezzo length
is going to be hugely individual for
some people any more than three
accumulation weeks in a row is a total
disaster
for some people that's just when they're
getting warmed up huge individual
differences there so there's no dogma
there
number two mesocycles number per block
some people can do five
progressive mesocycles in a mass gaining
block and be totally fine some people do
two and they fall off the face of the
earth
as long as both people are doing their
best there is gonna be there are gonna
be differences and over the career there
are gonna be differences
you may have used to being able to do 20
consistent weeks of hard training but
now that you're bigger stronger and so
and so forth and especially
your joints and connective tissues and
total system get a bigger beating you
may not be able to do
five anymore maybe now it's four and
maybe later is three and so on and so
forth
re-sensitization and active rest phase
length look if you're a beginner
you re-sensitize uh for one week okay a
week of deload is as good for you as it
is for an ifbb pro taking a month away
from training
but on the other hand that ifb pro may
need that month they may not want to
take a month off of training or a month
of easier training
but they have to in order to
re-sensitize it's different between
individuals nutrition phase length and
the intensity you bring to your
nutrition stuff some people can gain a
pound a week
and it's mostly muscle for weeks and
weeks some people gain half a pound a
week
and it's mostly fat and they have to go
even slower or just take take the fat on
the chin
some of the lengths some people can do a
16 week fat loss diet
feel hunky dory no crazy cortisol stuff
no crazy hunger they lose a bunch of fat
super good
some people can get even leaner than
those people but they need to go in
shorter bursts so they may do a 12-week
diet
take a maintenance phase and then do
another 12-week diet because they know
they can't hang for 16 weeks
that is a difference that will come up
right so again there's no
broad swath of things that work for
everyone it all has to be to some extent
individualized degree of muscle group
specialization
some people will be able to have a
systemic mrv that's so high
they can specialize all their muscle
groups at once for years and years and
years and just make great gains
other individuals after getting to be
intermediates their systemic mr v is so
low
that they really have to start cycling
muscle groups okay it's upper body focus
for the next several mesos
after that next several muscles lower
body focus and there's a lot of
tinkering that goes on because they
can't smash it all in big differences
there and of course
loading range bias across the block some
folks
can start with just a little bit more
heavy stuff
and pretty close to moderate light stuff
and then switch to exactly the same of
all three and then a little bit
less heavy moderate up a little and
light up a little towards the
last meso cycle of the block some
individuals so
most of their work is heavy in the
beginning a little bit of moderate tiny
bit of light or even no light work
the middle block is 50 50 moderate and
heavy
the next block they're just done as far
as getting anything out of heavy
responses or joints or trash
there's very little heavy training if
any plenty of moderate training and a
ton of light training to really push
metabolites
myself and my colleague jared feather
here at renaissance periodization
i like a slightly more even approach he
likes a nice big pulsatile approach
there's not a correct answer there it's
very very individual
so a couple of final implications
from this lecture no individual is
exempt from the training principles okay
so there's no one there that doesn't
need to manage fatigue
no one doesn't have to apply overload
specificity works for everyone
but every individual needs this applied
a little bit differently with attention
to their needs
and responses and abilities this is true
for any single individual
between one individual another and it
becomes
more important as training age increases
the more if you give a decent program to
a beginner they're going to get great
results
if you give a decent program to an
immediate they're going to get decent
results
if you give a decent program to an
advanced lifter they may get no results
or even regress okay it would just get
crappy results
as you get more and more advanced and
you reach your genetic ceiling
individualization becomes more and more
important which when beginners are like
oh i wonder what rep range is best for
me it's kind of like shut up
just do regular lifting and you'll learn
and when you will learn by the time you
learn years later then you will need it
it's really one of those things and
how do you do this in the real world you
begin with your best guess
was your average conservative guess you
detect the responses am i healing on
time does the squat technique work for
me or is another one better
auto regulate and change the plan on the
margins not completely throwing things
away
okay if two time a week training worked
okay for you
don't go to five time a week training
for the same muscle group go from two to
three
right or from four down to three so on
and so forth slowly
as indicated and over time two things
will happen you'll be making way better
gains than you could be
and you'll be learning more and more and
more what your body is doing so that you
can get better
and you know every single beginning of a
meso is to some extent to guess
like you're going to do some exercise
rotations differently some rep range
just differently and you're just like
i hope this works i still say it i've
been training for like 20 years
and i'm supposed to be this whatever
expert every time i make a new mezzo for
myself i'm like
it is going to work pretty well but i
don't know sometimes i do hack squats in
the new lunges and i realize like that's
not hitting my glutes at all it's just
all quads
i'm an idiot i should have seen this
coming sometimes i could have never seen
it coming so you will get better
if you apply individualization over time
but remember there are always surprises
and there's always time for auto
regulation folks thank you so much for
tuning in
see you next time
you
