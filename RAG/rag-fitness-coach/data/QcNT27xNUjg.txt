more more who's underneath you slow
what's underneath deep
speed
more again we're going all the way here
[Music]
yo
youtube i'm dr mike you probably know
that that's jared feather he's not sure
he knows that because he's in prep and
his brain doesn't work anymore he's
gonna make an attempt to introduce these
very very lovely ladies today jared
feather who are your friends oh god
which i'm just kidding
we are here with kelly klein and
jennifer
dory
like the fish
like the fish
this is number two uh miss bikini
olympia actually and she is seven days
out from the arnold
classic in columbus ohio it's just the
show this year right it's just the show
they're not even doing the expo anything
only her show yeah the first show
actually
so we're going to be pushing her seven
days out is probably about when people
do their last hard session for their
prep so she's gonna be pushed fairly
hard but kelly here says she feels
fantastic on four hours of sleep only so
she's gonna be pushed a little harder
but it's gonna be a good glute session
uh gonna be starting off some hit
thrusts and
taking it from there probably doing a
little bit of like a really cool lunge
machine action you guys will get a kick
out of that and then i think we're
probably gonna finish up with maybe sumo
squats
but uh who knows you know life's this
beautiful wonderful thing that you
explore you don't just do we're gonna
smell the roses we might vomit blood
glutes are getting destroyed see you in
the next exercise
definitely not
[Music]
hey yo it's philly guy mike glutes
whatever fuck
jk list the best glute exercise is
actually a stack of exercises that have
good sfrs and you rotate them to
variation
fucking beautiful
today glute hip thrust actually people
say glute bridges and hip thrusts are
different i don't think they're
different i think it's just different
setup and pointless nomenclature a
distinction without a difference as
intellectuals say hip thrust machine
here at powerhouse is actually really
awesome and uh it allows a really good
peak contraction it's nice and comfy you
can overload a lot we're going to be
doing sets of 10 to 20 reps because
jared feather and i have the belief that
low rep hip thrusts for most people not
all don't do a whole lot of good it's
really difficult to get a good mind
muscle connection with the glutes and
that seems to be important to hitting
them up um
we're gonna do a few sets here uh
real focus on technique because one of
these ladies is super close to her show
she's shredded she's peeled she's really
low on energy technique has to be the
focus otherwise injury can result we're
trying to avoid the fuck out of that
you like seeing me talking this ugly
face nonsense let's get over to the
glute training you feel me
try to keep it on the boots you got it
good
stop at the top convince me
good three more
one hole yep
two hold
yep three hold two more bonus round and
you're done
one
it's okay
two
[Music]
by the way no big deal but
god's listening and swear words are not
funny
sometimes they're neither they're needed
though let's get those good paws the top
okay you got it
good
there it is perfect
three
hold it at the top 11. last one all the
way through push 12. very good
so again jen is seven days out from the
arnold uh generally this is not
something you would put first
or a lunge first you would mostly want
to put in a heavy compound glute
hamstring based exercise straight leg
deadlifts sumo squats uh deficit tumor
deadlifts things like that that you
normally see us do with people
unless you're trying to pre-exhaust the
glutes so the glutes can take over even
more in those types of exercises bikini
wellness things of that nature those
types of competitions you kind of want
to try to do that in some of your
sessions and some other sessions you
want to put the heavy compounds first so
this one because she's seven days out
we're treating this as her lighter
session and we are pre-exhausting those
boots so the next exercise is going to
be a lunge just still not a heavy
compound and then we'll move to a heavy
compound after that so that way the
glutes are taking over the majority of
the stimulus at the end of the session
and we're not putting too much in the
quads in the hamstrings
all the way through deep
push
there
push 20 keep going keep going you're a
fucking animal good all the way through
yes two more all the way through and one
last one all the way through in rack
good stuff
on that one you didn't you were such a
you were such a lady
[Music]
so on to exercise number two which is
technically kind of a lunge movement but
it's accomplished by a super crazy super
futuristic sliding machine i know that's
not what the exercise is really called
but why wouldn't we call that wouldn't
that be fun anyway
sets of we'll see how many reps maybe
around 10 somewhere because this is a
real tough movement requires a crapload
of eccentric control tends to fly the
fly fry the glutes fry the hams
adductors as well and you do get a bit
of quad work out of this but the way
we're going to be doing it is try to sit
real far back
one leg at a time and get it done
let's see what's cooking
off
phenomenal two more let's go pressure on
the inside of your heel on this side of
your heel
push that knee into forward
and one last one
nice and deep
slow
and up with some force
beautiful switch legs
right here
right here and should we stay here shin
stays here use the glue
good
why don't you take a half second pause
at the bottom
right there pull yourself
yes beautiful and then again
pause
and then pull
a few more you're doing great
good stuff
pause
pull
awesome
sure of course
kelly come on
we're gonna get to do the arnold also oh
yeah okay there you go
let's go slow
chest up
pause pull
good
more
[Music]
[Applause]
and up
good
and again
you get the biggest glutes of all time
[Music]
off bigger than jared good bigger than
jareds
slow chest stop
up
good two more
let's do it again same thing it's
supposed to be hard we are here for the
difficult let's go
good switch hands take your time chest
up
and pull good a little deeper just a
tiny bit deeper
feel that pressure this one hit up
everything is flawless stay a little bit
more upright
slow
controlled upright pause into the pad
into the pad
better and one more
slow control stay upright
oh there it is
yes
good
very good very good
ladies this way
[Music]
the lunch machine thing really
overloaded the glutes and of course
stood some adductor and a bit of ham and
a bit of quad and now we do sumo spots
on typically sumo squats with a slow
eccentric and a pause are a good
adductor exercise actually a good quad
exercise okay glute exercise but because
the glutes are pre-exhausted they tend
to be the weak link in the chain now
making this a fractionally better
stimulus the raw stimulus isn't as high
but the amount of it that goes to the
glutes and is limited by the glutes is
now higher because they got a lot of
stimulus already they don't need a ton
they just need to go right into the
glutes that sounded better in my head
let's get these done multiple sets of
around 5 to 15 reps we start at 15 and
they fall down just because of fatigue
the real big focus here is to descend
slowly take a full pause and ask jared
will be cueing to activate the glutes on
the way up let's all do it together on
youtube
better
again
the harder it is the closer to failure
you are the less you have to do a great
thing
ah there it is good two more let's get
this open make these perfect slow pause
open open up open open open open good
one last one keep your chest up the
whole time don't let the bar punch you
out
