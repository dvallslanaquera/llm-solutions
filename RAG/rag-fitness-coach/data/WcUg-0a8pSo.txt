my name is milo wolf i'm a phd student
in
sports science i've actually been
prepping for
in some form
nearly half a year
initially super easy as i mentioned when
you get down from like 20 10 it's a fun
ride you look better every day
performance is pretty much the same the
whole way or maybe it's like the better
uh hunger is a non-issue usually
so firstly 10 15 weeks very pleasant
very fun uh you know everyone gasses you
up and gives you compliments on how good
you look how you've been losing weight
and
you know you start thinking oh this is
going to be pretty easy
but then i would say the last
sort of month out now i would say the
last five weeks or so i've been quite
rough and so it's been
kind of like a
test of discipline habit formation and
willpower
where
all i want to do now is sit down and eat
but instead i gotta walk around train
when i don't feel like at all and not
eat and so it's been challenging and i
think the last 10 weeks have been
the most challenging
i'm
fairly nervous
um
obviously it's my first time sitting on
stage
and so just the idea of being fully
tanned
being backstage and everything is sort
of surreal
um
but at the same time because i've got
some experience competing in
powerlifting in various sports
i know that when you're on stage you
don't see anyone you don't hear anything
really you're just doing your thing
it's over in a flash
and then you're off and competition's
over ultimately i
entered a competition story called this
prep mostly for the experience not to
win
not to
achieve this understand or anything just
do my best and to see how i enjoy it so
in the future i can decide whether or
not i want to dedicate myself more so to
this
so yeah i'm going in with mineral
expectations we'll see what happens um
but i'll do my best
