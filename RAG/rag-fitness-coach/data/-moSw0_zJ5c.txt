hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance position
i'm here with the great
the one the only jared feather
and we are going to be demonstrating
barbell
curls to get huge guns a few mistakes
and how to correct them just a quick
obvious note the target of the barbell
curl
is the biceps but remember that there's
a few other muscles in there
that are called forearm flexors they do
this they're also targets
and your actual form is going to get
pretty jacked too so yeah the biceps are
the most important
but in general we want bigger arms
bigger forearms
all the flexors there let's get at it
let's take a look at the first mistake
[Music]
all right the first mistake as you may
have predicted is using
too low of a range of motion it's
tempting
because you can use more weight but
unfortunately it doesn't stress the
muscle
using all of its motor units it doesn't
provide any attention under stretch it
doesn't provide a peak contraction
which is not exactly great you end up
using a lot of weight to accomplish
as much or less which is just super
fatiguing to the rest of your body
because you have to
pick up 135 pounds and drag it out and
do curls with it there's a certain
amount of spinal loading so on and so
forth and leaning forward with it
just sucks if you can use less weight
through a bigger range of motion that's
best jared show us a typical
partial range of motion bicep curl that
folks do
yeah like hey we're doing curls sort of
and you know
it doesn't even come all the way down or
go all the way up
so there are two ways to fix this
because that's good enough
two ways to fix this one way is to do
the traditional barbell curl where you
start fully extended
and come up with no elbow movement until
your biceps are taken through a full
range of motion that's totally fine way
to do it that's super cool
the other way to do it is to actually
involve some shoulder flexion
your elbows end up moving up and you
move the curl all the way up to your
face
people say like weight but you're using
front delts the thing is
the biceps are a shoulder flexor they
are involved in the movement
of pushing your elbows forward so it's
totally fine to use them there as well
which technique is best it's not clear
and it really comes down
to preference and comfort you can do
either one just make sure that if you're
telling yourself you're not doing any
flexion
stop when your biceps hit and don't stop
here or something like that
full range of motion either way is
totally fine
the next mistake as you may have also
predicted is an uncontrolled eccentric
the descent of the bicep curl if it is
controlled supplies an eccentric
contraction to the biceps which grows
them a ton
if you curl as hard as you can of the
way up but then drop the weight
you can do more reps but there's no
magic rep counter in the sky that's
saying oh you're amazing if you did 10
reps or whatever
it's all about making sure you milk
everything out of each rep which means
control and tons of force on the
concentric and controlling eccentric as
well jared show us what the mistake
looks like
pretty decent curl and then bloop it
drops down in pretty decent curl
and bloop and it's really tempting to do
this good enough
it's really tempting to do this because
you can do more reps and it's
really tough to do an eccentric control
contraction does the eccentric have to
be like three or five seconds long no
that's definitely an option if you want
to try it as a variation
but in general just make sure you're
actively contracting the muscles
and slowing the bar down against gravity
jared can you show us what that looks
like
so the concentric movement is going to
look pretty much the same
but then the eccentric is controlled and
notice he's not going super slow
but he's making sure that he's fighting
against gravity on the way
down which provides an independent
hypertrophic stimulus
to his biceps
the next mistake in bicep curls happens
all the time in gyms all across the
world
is not having a standard range of motion
for each rep
some reps are full some reps are partial
some reps are somewhere in between
you can't count how many reps you're
doing accurately you can't accurately
track your performance
you can't tell if you're overloading
enough you need 15 reps last week
how many reps do you do at the same
weight this week well what the hell is a
rep if some of the reps were different
uh degrees of range of motion you don't
even know if you're doing more
mechanical work this week than last week
even if you do know the rep number in
order to be accurate about progressively
overloading and tracking
see if you're actually getting stronger
actually getting bigger you have to use
essentially very similar technique
rep to wrap to rep the cool thing is is
if you go all the way up
and all the way down it self
standardizes jared show us the mistake
here that some folks make do about three
reps
and one of them is pretty decent and
then the next one's like uh
sort of stopped halfway and then one
just doesn't go all the way down
every rep looks weird every lip is not
countable against the others
or against other weeks and so on and so
forth but if jared was to do proper
barbell curls
then every rep was essentially going to
look almost identical
he's going to curl up and all the way
down and all the way up
and all the way down it's super easy to
keep track and let's say he goes to
failure jared can you fake failure for
us
oh and then
let's do one more let's say hey fail
halfway through just go halfway up
oh he can't do any more boom that's it
so that failure point
remember we've had let's say it was 14
reps
and then that half rep because you know
all the reps were the same distance
moved
you can count that 14. it's like okay i
got exactly 14.
i couldn't get 15. because some people
say like when they fail right here
they put it down to like 15 like 15 of
what that wasn't a full rep motherfucker
that doesn't count so you know you did
14 at a certain weight
deload or whatever move on to your next
week later
when you're progressing and you're
tracking you can okay at 65
pounds i got 14 reps for sure because
everything was the same range of motion
and i couldn't get my full range of
motion i failed on the 15th rep
which is to say i can check only 14 then
you got 15 reps or 16 reps you can be
sure
you got bigger stronger and you're
progressing because all the reps were
identical
you know you actually made gains whereas
if you do this and some
reps are weird and you sort of hit maybe
failure or one of the reps you sort of
maybe count it you have no idea what's
going on anymore it prevents accurate
overloading and accurate tracking
how much should your body lean during
curls a lot of folks get really
particular about making sure to stand up
super straight
not leaning back at all not leaning
forward the answer is if you don't move
with a ton of momentum which we'll get
to in another mistake
you can lean whatever feels best make
sure it's standardized and it's the same
rep to rep so for example
some folks like to do curls straight up
and down so they have a very rigid body
posture
and they'll do a curl just like that and
their whole body is straight up and down
yep just like that perfect and then some
folks like to tilt their hips back
get a little bit of uh some action here
in the biceps and then they're gonna be
curling more forward
it's a different sensation slightly
different mind muscle connection for the
biceps
this is not wrong as long as you know
it's a separate
type of approach separate kind of
exercise so go ahead and rack
don't mix the reps in the same set and
don't mix
the reps set to set to set but tell
yourself in your log book i'm doing
curls
normal just say barbell curls and then
you do them straight with no lean
and then you later a month or two you
can use a variant you can say okay i'm
doing slightly lean curls
in which case you lean forward a little
bit and get that real nasty contraction
at the top
not any one of those is wrong or right
it's just a matter of preference
some people even like to lean back a bit
and that's totally fine as long as they
stay that way
the next mistake maybe the most common
mistakes in gyms across the world for
any exercise
it's cheating by using swinging and
momentum
on the barbell bicep curl what is the
point of cheating to use more weight
so that that guy over there in the
corner finally gives you the kind of
look you're
asking for and you won the best date
ever he buys you champagne
it's fucking love at first sight
unbelievable it's all because you
cheated your way
to curling 205 pounds where you really
weren't strong enough to curl 65 pounds
for more reps so here's the deal
the target is the biceps we're gonna
make our body rigid
and only move our shoulder and elbow to
target the biceps
none of this bullshit jared show us what
a real
manly swing curl looks like cheat to
grow bro
you got us all starts at the hips oh man
yep
it's basically a glute exercise with
your arms sort of cursorily involved
good enough very good show us the right
way to do it
right everything's rigid notice his
shoulders move
a little bit his elbows move a ton and
that's it and if you start approaching
failure do you start cheating
yeah no right if you start approaching
failure show us what going to actual
failure looks like
up and then there's a huge temptation to
get another rep with cheating don't
do it that's it that's failure let the
biceps be the limiting factor
there is a technical reason why cheating
is a bad idea it's not just like some
ego shit we're like don't fuck cheat bro
if you cheat and you move with your hips
you're getting more stimulus to the
muscles of your hips
your back your glutes are you fucking
training those when you're doing curls
no you're not you're training your
biceps does it help activate your biceps
more
by swinging no not really as a matter of
fact it takes your technique and your
mind muscle connection away from your
biceps
and it makes you sort of think about
just get the weight up the best way to
do it
is really focus on your biceps strict
technique don't move and grind
your biceps into the movement when they
fail
push them harder and then when you can't
do it anymore
that entire set was first of all limited
by biceps so you know you got a great
set
you went truly as close to failure as
you wanted you didn't use any other
systems muscles and also
if you start using the other muscles
they start to fatigue
if you're using way more weight than you
need to swinging it around
that's more volume for the rest of your
body that you're using
instead of recovering as best as you can
for later glute training and later back
training
you're essentially adding a bit of
fatigue using bicep curls with too much
weight it's either going to interfere
with your back workouts with your
deadlifts
with your squats and so on and so forth
keep muscle training
to the target muscle use your biceps for
bicep curls
fucking weird idea i know and then if
you want bigger glutes
do some deadlifts or do some uh you know
elevated glute bridges or something
to actually target the glutes when
they're supposed to go don't mix the two
and don't fucking cheat yourself and
don't lie to yourself if you can only
curl
65 pounds on a barbell for a set of 10
that doesn't matter
who gives a shit all that matters is how
big your biceps are and that's the
statement about life in general
how do you get bigger biceps you start
where you start the 65
and you slowly do a few more reps and
then you're doing 70 and then you're
doing 75 and then you have giant biceps
and everything in your life is
perfect
an interesting mistake that a lot of
folks make when they get into the super
technique and biomechanics heavy side of
things
is thinking that their technique has to
be so perfect that it actually starts
violating the laws of physics
specifically mechanics people will say
you know watch you curl a really decent
weight and they'll say how come you're
not standing straight up
like when you're curling you lean back a
little bit when you're curling
you lean back a little bit because your
center of gravity moves
forward when you push weight ahead of
you you have to lean back to compensate
so you don't fall forward
it has to happen to some extent and the
more weight you're using relative to
your body weight the more you have to
lean back a little bit
to in order not to fall jared show us
what that looks like people get really
strict
they do that oh and then they have to
adjust with a step do a real curl
it's okay to lean back a little bit and
if we had more weight on the bar
jared would have to lean back even a
little more to make sure that he didn't
fall forward
so perfect good enough when you're
aiming for strictness
make sure it's realistic strictness and
not
something that's completely insane
violates the laws of physics
and doesn't allow for body compensation
it's okay for your body
to naturally move forward and back a
little bit to adjust for momentum
differences
and adjust for center of gravity
differences the center of mass
differences
that's totally fine and you know you're
doing that well when you're not actively
trying to cheat because people say well
that's cheating
cheating you fucking know when you're
cheating when you're totally stable but
you're like
i'm going to use my hips that's fucking
cheating if as you're currently you have
to lean back a little bit so you don't
fall for that's 100
fine
the next mistake is grip confusion
and failing to detect a really good mind
muscle connection and get a really good
stimulus
two are very very much tied together so
folks will say what's the optimal grip
for barbara colors it doesn't exist
because human genetic variation in
anthropometry is really high
some folks actually feel their biceps
most when they get a wide grip
and it hurts their elbows and shoulders
the least and they can use the most
weight
under control some folks prefer a medium
grip which is going to look something
like that
and some folks prefer a closer grip and
with this grip their elbows and
shoulders feel the best they can produce
the most force and they feel the tension
most
in their biceps and at higher reps they
feel the burn
that is the answer to what grip you
should use you should experiment
figure out what's best for you folks
some people don't even like barbell
curls
some people prefer easy curls the bent
bar so much more that that's all they do
that's totally fine some people like
neither and they prefer dumbbells
that's totally fine you don't have to do
this exercise but if you're gonna do
barbell curls be at the straight bar or
the easy bar
find a grip that works well for you
experiment here's what you're looking
for
do my shoulders feel weird and so weird
and so often
perhaps so painful that they get in the
way of my being able to do the movement
properly with full
effort unrestricted if that's the case
find a different grip
elbows same thing if my elbows feel
weird if my elbows hurt
find something else wrists sometimes
your wrists will feel weird in some grip
or another so you've got to play around
with all of those and lastly
are you getting a good stimulus to your
biceps specifically
with heavier weights do you feel tension
running through your biceps or do you
feel tension sometimes with some grips
you're like your forearms feel really
tense but your biceps you're like i
don't know i don't know if a whole lot
is happening
with higher reps do you feel the burn
the lactic acid accumulating in your
biceps or do you feel it somewhere else
some people do curls in their forearms
or other parts of their arm will start
to feel it sometimes their elbows just
hurt
and then it's absolutely no good do you
get a bicep pump from it after
successive sets
and later on do you feel disruption in
the bicep do you feel weakness in the
bicep potentially soreness
in the bicep you don't have to feel sore
in the biceps and most people don't but
after a bicep workout do you have a
bicep pump and do your biceps kind of
feel like jello
if that's the case great but if you do
curls with a certain grip your forearms
feel like jello and they're the ones
that get sore but your biceps feel
nothing
choose a different grip choose a
different execution
only you know what's best for you you
have to experiment to find what works
what is too heavy or too light for
bicep curls it really between
doing sets of five and doing sets of 30
there's no right answer there
except the one that you find in your own
experimentation
some folks will curl in a five to ten
rep range sets of eight with a barbell
and feel an
unbelievable amount of tension their
joints will feel totally fine it trashes
them and it really gets them great
results and they're able to progress
in reps and in weight very very robustly
over the course of weeks and months
some folks really prefer the 10 to 20
rep range for that combination of pump
and burn or really really good
connection in the bicep that's totally
fine
some folks can do barbell curls in the
20 to 30 rep range although i would say
that's more rare
because in that rep range a lot of folks
their forearms will start to be the
limiting factor
and they don't really feel the biceps
anymore it's one of those where you put
the bar down and you're like
you're trying to shake out your forearm
cramps that's not great because the
bicep might not be the limiting factor
on that
it doesn't itself approach very close to
failure your forearm does
and the reason you stop the set is
because your forearms got tired great
way to get massive forearms
but there's better ways through actual
wrist curls and so on and so forth so
find the rep range in which
the biceps feel a ton of tension and or
burn and
seem to be the limiting factor for most
people that'll be between
5 and 20 reps sets some people prefer
higher you'll never know
unless you try it yourself and just
because barbell curls are no good for
super high reps doesn't mean everything
is you might find a machine
or dumbbells or cables that you can do
for a different rep range
much more comfortably give it a shot
no dogma try all these tips and tricks
see what works for you give it some time
do your best and be honest with yourself
about what good technique really is
if you have a question write it in the
comments below if you have a good answer
if you know what you're talking about
try to answer questions we'll all help
each other out folks thank you so much
for joining us see you next time
for the next exercise and hey real quick
if you have an exercise
that you want us to break down good
technique bad technique let us know in
the comments and we'll try to ignore you
because remember
you don't matter
