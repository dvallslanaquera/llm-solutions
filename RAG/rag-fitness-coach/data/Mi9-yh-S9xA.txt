and if we agree that there's such a
thing as not training hard enough and
that there's such a thing as training
too hard which i think anybody who
really knows anything would probably
agree on then we have to define
what this zone actually means in a way
that people can measure in some way
what's up guys sean dallawani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today i wanted to give
you my thoughts on
this whole rpe discussion that quite a
few fitness channels have been talking
about lately
athleanx made a video about it where he
referred to rpe
as a really poor excuse and basically
said that it will cause people to not
train hard enough
jeff nippard did a response pretty
strongly defending the use of rpe
so did vegan gains and then greg ducette
and scott herman they've also talked
about it as well
and they were kind of in the middle but
it does seem to me like they lean more
toward the side of rpe not being
necessary
and then there are plenty of other
channels who have discussed this as well
with different opinions
and then not to mention lots of
discussion in the comments on those
videos as well
and the central question is basically
just about whether or not rpe
is a useful metric to use in your
training program when you're trying to
build
muscle and for those who don't know rpe
stands for
rating of perceived exertion and what it
basically describes is just
how hard you're pushing yourself on your
sets or in other words how close to
muscular failure you are training
rpe 10 would mean going 100 all out
until you can't get another rep
in proper form no matter how hard you
try rpe 9
means stopping one rep before that point
rpe 8 is 2 reps before that point and so
on
now i'm not going to go through and play
a bunch of clips from all these
different videos because it would just
be way
too hard to piece that all together i'm
just going to mention some of the
common points that i've seen mentioned
and give you my overall stance on this
subject
so first off should you use rpe in your
training
what i would say is that at the end of
the day if we are creating a description
of how someone should train
in order to build muscle optimally which
is what we're doing when we put out this
fitness content
then just like we talk about training
volume and rep ranges
exercise selection forum cues weekly
training splits
rest periods progression schemes
advanced techniques so on and so forth
just like we give guidelines for all of
those things i think it goes without
saying that we definitely
should also give guidelines when it
comes to the most primary training
variable there is
the one that actually stimulates muscle
growth at the most basic level
which is effort or you could call it
intensiveness
you could call it intensity technically
intensity means percentage of one rep
max but
in bodybuilding terms sometimes we use
the word intensity to mean effort as
well
um or you could just say how close to
failure you're training uh or of course
you can call it rpe rating of perceived
exertion
or rir which stands for reps in reserve
they're all different terms
but they describe the same basic thing
there should be no reason
why giving guidelines for all of those
other training variables
is perfectly fine and is expected but
then if we apply a concrete metric
for uh effort level per set all of a
sudden it's an over complication and
it's too scientific
since there's really nothing more
complicated or more scientific
about rpe than there is about training
volume or rep ranges or frequency or
anything else
and a very common response that i've
seen in videos and in the comments
sections as well
is that people should just forget about
rpe stop overthinking it and just get
under the bar and train
hard now people who follow my content
know that i am not at
all in favor of over complicating things
and i think for most average people
watching these videos who just want to
build a strong
lean muscular physique but they're not
necessarily competing and they're not
trying to do it at the very highest
level
in that case effective hypertrophy
training really is not that complicated
and it's not something that you're going
to need
to analyze to death to get very good
results
but given the fact that effort level per
set is an extremely important factor for
gaining muscle
uh and i would argue that it's actually
the most important factor because it's
the primary stimulus that actually
triggers growth in the first place
because of that we definitely should
talk about it with some level of detail
and we need to establish some sort of
measurable framework of some kind
to say you know this is what it means to
not train hard enough for maximum gains
and this is what it means to train
too hard um and yes there is such a
thing as training too hard
because if you're doing too many sets at
too high of an rpe then it can
ultimately push you
past your ability to optimally recover
and it can increase your chances for
injury as well
and the problem with telling people to
just train hard or to train harder
and i know this firsthand through years
and years of coaching people and lifting
with tons of different training partners
uh observing different people in the gym
watching different people's youtube
videos
different people can have very different
ideas of what it means to
train hard and so telling somebody to
just train hard
now yeah that might be totally fine
advice for a segment of people don't get
me wrong
there are plenty of trainees out there
who can just go into the gym lift
slowly add weight to the bar over time
and they'll just naturally fall into
the right intensity zone and they'll
make great gains that way okay there's
always individual variation at play
but i'm just saying that overall across
the board
that type of advice just isn't clear
enough and it does not guarantee that
somebody will actually train hard enough
and it also doesn't guarantee that they
won't take things too far
so we need some kind of concrete
reference range to go by
so one person uh training hard could
mean going to all-out failure and beyond
on every single set
to another person it could mean one to
two reps in reserve
um it could mean four reps in reserve
for somebody else uh hell to another it
might not even involve putting real
weights on the bar at all
and i also don't agree with the common
argument that rpe
will cause people to under train because
they'll end up leaving too many reps in
the tank i think it's really just a
matter of giving them the proper
instructions on how to apply it
anything will give poor results if it's
not applied properly and i would
actually say that
in a lot of cases rpe or rir is
exactly what somebody who isn't training
hard enough is going to need
so that they can get a clear idea of
where their effort level truly needs to
be and i've seen this many
many times when coaching people over the
years by using a concrete metric
you're getting rid of that subjective
component and you're giving an
objective standard that can actually be
quantified in the real world
instead of something abstract like just
go hard
or push yourself or get uncomfortable or
whatever else
rpe or rir just gives people an
objective standard that they can
actually make
sense of and that doesn't mean that rpe
or rar is gonna be
a hundred percent perfect all the time
but it doesn't have to be perfect okay
it just has to be accurate enough and as
long as it's
more accurate than just saying train
hard then i would say that it's
definitely worth using and i think there
can also be
a bit of a bias from the more advanced
trainees out there
because to them it's a lot more obvious
what training hard means
since they have so much experience from
years and years of lifting but they tend
to forget that for a less experienced
lifter it's not necessarily obvious
what training hard really means and if
you just take a look around most
commercial gyms i would say that
that's pretty clear to see once you're
more advanced then proper training
effort becomes
a much more intuitive thing and you can
probably just apply it automatically in
a lot of cases
but for a lot of novices that's really
not the case they truly don't know
how hard they're supposed to be going so
i would say that the question
isn't should we or should we not give
guidelines for effort level per set i
would say that we absolutely should
because it's such a fundamental factor
for muscle growth and it's
open to a wide range of interpretations
and if we agree
that there's such a thing as not
training hard enough and that there's
such a thing as training too hard which
i think anybody who
really knows anything would probably
agree on then we have to define
what this zone actually means in a way
that people can measure in some way
so the real questions are what is the
optimal effort level per set in the
first place
and just how closely do you actually
need to track this
so first off how hard should you train
to build muscle what rpe or rir
should you use now i've talked about
this many times before so i'll just
briefly go over it
there's no one definitive answer that
applies across the board for every
single person
in all situations so we can only give
general guidelines
but i think if you really uh look at it
you will find that
most experts out there tend to give
pretty similar advice on this question
aside from maybe which direction they
lean a bit more toward
i think most people will agree that
around three to four reps in a reserve
is sort of the minimum effort level that
you need to use to stimulate
meaningful muscle growth if you're
consistently not training to at least
that level
then not much is gonna happen it's not
gonna be a strong enough incentive for
your body to really adapt and grow and
if you're only ever training at that
level
yeah you will get some results but it
definitely won't be anywhere near your
maximum potential
and then on the other end most will
agree not all but most
that you probably shouldn't be going to
all-out failure all the time or in other
words you shouldn't be always going to
rpe 10 or 0 rir
you can go there in moderation you can
even have phases of training using
a lower volume to fail your style but it
shouldn't be
on every set of every workout over the
long term because in the overall picture
you're going to be creating an excessive
amount of fatigue relative to
muscle stimulus so if those are the sort
of
minimum and maximum levels that you can
train at on a moderate percentage of
your overall sets
then generally speaking you'll find that
about an
rpe of eight to nine or a rir
of one to two that's going to be the
approximate sweet spot where the highest
percentage of your overall sets should
probably fall
meaning that if you were pushing with a
hundred percent maximum effort okay gun
to your head life on the line
the absolute most you could perform
would be about one to two more reps
while maintaining proper form that's the
point where the set should end
that's going to be high enough to create
a significant stimulus for growth
but not so high that you push yourself
beyond your ability
to optimally recover and then where
exactly you
kind of fall on that scale that'll
depend at least partly on
your experience level so the more of a
beginner you are the more you can get
away with
slightly lower rpes you probably don't
need to be going to failure
and then as you become more experienced
the more muscle you gain uh the more
your body is adapted to weight training
the more you're gonna need to kind of
push that envelope in the other
direction
and concentrate more of your efforts at
higher rpes
and mixing in some of those rpe 10 slash
zero rer failure sets or even going
beyond that point and then keep in mind
that genetics
also play a role in this as well some
people just respond better at
varying levels of effort and volume and
that's something that you're going to
have to experiment with for yourself
over time through your training career
basically
some lifters can get great results doing
lower volume but higher rpes
i can personally vouch for that that
style of training always worked really
well for me in the past and it still
does
um and it's actually what i'm doing
right now at the moment and then some
other trainees
can do very well at a lower rpe but
doing more total sets
and then of course some go in the middle
as well so there is some individual
variation at play here
and as you learn more about how your
body responds to training you can go
ahead and tweak things for yourself
and then the other question on the whole
rpe rir subject
is just how detailed do you actually
need to go with this so do you need to
specifically track your rpe on paper
and if so to what degree and i think
probably uh for a lot of the more
anti-rpe guys out there this is probably
one of their main gripes
i'm sure most of them recognize that
there is a general effort zone that most
people should aim for during their
workouts but they're more so arguing
against getting too caught up in it
and over analyzing it uh and yeah i
think if we're talking strictly in terms
of building muscle okay this has nothing
whatsoever to do with powerlifting
that's an entirely separate question
just basic hypertrophy training then
yeah i don't think that the majority of
typical lifters out there
need to get super hung up on this with
an exact rpe mapped out
for every set of every exercise over a
complete training cycle
and using some highly detailed rpe
cycling waving deloading protocol
if you're someone who really prefers the
analytical side of things um you like
having that training structure or you're
a more advanced lifter who's really
trying to nail down their training
and squeeze out every bit of muscle
growth and strength gain that you can
um or again you're a competitive
strength athlete then sure have at it
you know map
out the entire thing all down to the
exact rpe for every set but for the
majority of
average hypertrophy trainees out there
uh the demographic who are mostly
watching this content i don't think
that's going to be necessary i think
just understanding where muscular
failure truly is
and then having a general rpe slash rar
range in mind
that you're aiming for i think that
that's probably going to be good enough
as
long as you're consistently landing in
that zone and you're making steady
strength progress over time
the main thing is to just make sure that
you're not consistently under training
and that you're not consistently over
training and you can use rpe
as a general gauge for that just as a
general reference to make sure
and if you're a novice lifter then
contrary to what a lot of others have
said
i think you absolutely should strive uh
to learn
what that zero to three rir zone feels
like to lay the foundation for your
training moving forward
one of the biggest arguments i've seen
against rpe
is that beginners are really bad at
assessing rpe and so therefore they
shouldn't use it and i find that to be a
very
uh bizarre argument because the reality
is that most beginners
they aren't good at anything okay that's
called being a beginner uh we don't say
well beginners aren't very good at
squatting so therefore beginners
shouldn't squat
right they don't know how to squat so
they shouldn't do squats that really
doesn't make sense
no they just learn how to squat all they
need is the proper instructions
just like a beginner can learn the
proper form for all of their exercises
and they can learn about proper
programming and progression
and calories and macros and everything
else they can also learn how to gauge
their effort level i don't know why
we're talking about beginners
like they're these absolute brain dead
morons who have no ability to learn or
to figure anything out okay gauging reps
in reserve is not this
magical elusive thing that takes years
and years to solve it's actually not
that complicated
personally i started training when i was
13 years old and i didn't have any
problem at all learning what muscular
failure was or how to train to that
level
and anybody that i've coached has also
been able to learn it pretty quickly
just by giving them the proper guidance
it's really not that hard
obviously people need to learn proper
form and technique first and foremost
before they go and push to that level
but if you can just get someone to
understand that rpe 10
or 0r or muscular failure it really just
means that you're pushing as hard as you
possibly can
and that even if your life was on the
line you couldn't do another rep in
proper form
so either your form is still very solid
but you just can't get the bar to move
no matter how hard you try or the bar is
moving but your form has
noticeably broken down and yeah it'll
take a bit of time to really get a feel
for that
but if someone is truly serious about
their training then they can understand
what that generally means and they can
learn to push to that level and then as
a result
they're also going to learn what one to
three rar generally feels like as well
and now they can use that to
gauge their training moving forward it's
not an overcomplication
you know if i tell someone to tuck their
elbows and retract their scapula
and lower the bar under control during a
bench press no one says
stop over complicating it just unwrap
the bar and press so i don't see
why teaching somebody how to gauge what
is arguably the single most important
factor in their entire training program
i don't see why that should be looked at
any differently if you found the
