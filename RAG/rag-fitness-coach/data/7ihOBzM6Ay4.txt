hey dr mike how many calories should i
be eating to put on muscle hey youtube
user we've got an answer for you don't
you worry i'm doctor mike clearly this
is renaissance productions youtube
channel they let me use it when they're
out of town let's get into the super
simple way to figure out how many
calories you need to be eating in order
to become gigantic so big in fact that
you swell up inside the gym and
everyone's like oh they're like up
against the windows and boom the gym
explodes you're
on skyscrapers
um
biplane uh 1930's era 20's biplane and
and you're on top of the empire state
you're going to become king kong
with this diet plan and my diet plan i
mean one actual number here it is your
body weight in pounds you probably know
it i sure hope you do if you're from the
countries of europe then you need to
look up this weird american reconversion
calculator that is my european guy
accent if you hate it let us know in the
comments if you love it let us know in
the comments but
if you love it and the way you let us
know in the comments please
make it european style so like don't say
this is the greatest european impression
it's got to be like starts with a z this
is like the greatest maybe second
third best european impression i've seen
outside of uh of munich
anyway
take your body weight in pounds now you
know it
multiply it by 16.5 that's right the
number 16.5 not an integer i'm really
sorry that is going to result in roughly
on average
quarter of a percent to half a percent
body weight gain per week
that's a really good place to gain any
less than that and you're risking
miscalculating into maintenance and
essentially just don't gain much
any more than that and
you will become a fat slob
like i have many times gaining too fast
so 0.25 to 0.5 weekly weight gain is
great so an example is if you weigh 200
pounds and you multiply that by 16.5
that's 3
300 daily calories and a good first
guess
at how many calories you need in order
to continue to gain at a decent rate now
you may be advanced or this might not
work for you because you're unique
aren't we all unique in a certain sense
no
just kidding of course we are
some are just less unique than others
that's always funny to say
you might be more active than normal
you might sleep more or less than normal
you might be on some special supplements
a whole lot of stuff is different how do
you adjust this one number ridiculously
awful simple formula
into the real world of your body well
you start out at whatever it says
and then you monitor how your weight
changes if you're gaining weight too
fast cut some calories a couple hundred
if you're gaining weight too slow or
seemingly not at all a couple hundred
calories up you can do this every week
or two and it really just keeps you on
track
if
you don't want to do this maintenance
formula and you actually are sorry if
you don't want to do this muscle gain
formula
the 16.5 number because you're like i
think i know more about my body than one
tiny little number and my body weight
maybe you're correct but then you should
probably know your maintenance calories
already and then bulking is simply a
matter of adding 250 to 500 calories to
that and then using the same gas and
check system to keep you on track over
the you know 10 or 12 weeks of your
muscle gain diet
good news
very good news
there is
an app called the rp diet coach app it's
on itunes it's on google play and it
does two things super well
the one thing it does is it builds you a
mass gaining plan according to your
preferences you choose all the foods it
tells you what to eat and when you can
move the meals around you can move the
macros around all kinds of crazy stuff
and it automatically calculates how many
calories you need and updates this for
you every single week so for 15 bucks a
month
or so
you can just have all this done for you
you don't even need to worry about shit
multiplication numbers i don't do any of
that 16.5 nope i'm not using the decimal
i'm just getting the rp data i said it
does two things that's just one the
second thing it does is grandiosely more
important than the first guess what it
is i'll give you time think
a slight fraction
of the money from that app from your
bank account
goes to me and you may be asking already
what is it that i do with it i have a
few things to do with my money one
i breed german shepherds
some of them half are attack dogs i
never look them in the eyes
the other half are friendly and cuddly
you could come over and we could play
with them together if you can afford the
fee which is 500 a minute to play with
my german shepherds i told you the rp
died app does well
in addition to that i am building a
dirigible
i don't like getting to a place fast
you you buy ticket to hong kong go from
new york to hong kong 15 hours later i'm
in a different city different culture i
need time to adjust no no no also i
don't sit in these little seats look at
how big this seat is
i'm building a dirigible
which uh you pump it with i believe
hydrogen and a hydrogen gas is lighter
than air and it goes up and it floats
we've got a water slide in it it's under
construction a swimming pool
um people permanently paid to dress up
as furry stuffed animals that bring you
food they bring you various other things
it's an adult theme derisable and over
the course of weeks
it floats
across the pacific to hong kong
from new york i guess it also floats
across the united states and no you may
be thinking if you're super smart but dr
mike hong kong to new york we should go
really close to north pole because
that's actually on a sphere the shores
we're not in we're in short distances i
want to be able to see hawaii that's
right we dip south as i pass in my
dirigible and wave to people throw some
middle fingers occasionally you have to
what are they going to do you're in a
fucking derivative
see you guys next time
