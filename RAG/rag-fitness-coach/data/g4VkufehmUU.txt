for the close grip bench we're going to
lay back just like
usual we're going to Arch the back a
little bit retract the shoulder blades
just a bit and for small female clients
like Lauren we're going to keep our
hands right inside the grip right there
going to go all the way down to the
nipple line middle of the chest and all
the way back up full extension and we're
going to focus on keeping our elbows a
little bit more inside the body than
usual pressing straight up and just a
little bit back as we press full lock
out all the way down to the chest every
single time that's good and
wreck
