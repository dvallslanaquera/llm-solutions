welcome back to another episode of this
qantas prep series
in today's episode i want to talk about
a few things
uh but primarily how this contest prep
is informing my off-season
in a few different areas like health
areas for improvement and finally the
feedback from judges
first up how is this prep going for my
offseason in terms of health
i think during prep you can
learn a lot about where your health is
optimized
both psychologically and physiologically
so
first up i want to talk about blood
pressure i
used to have
somewhat elevated blood pressure
my systolic blood pressure was
consistently
high as in above 120 roughly
um
especially when i was at the
tail end of my masking phases
for example back in 2019 i walked all
the way up to
11314 kilograms which is around
250 pounds
and back then my systolic blood pressure
was quite bad uh i didn't get it
measured properly too often um
maybe out of shame what have you
but i was certainly above 140 or so um
and so prep is a good opportunity for
you to sort of obviously there are
confounders like
calorie intake being lower than usual
which can impact blood pressure
uh your salt intake might vary and so
forth
but and also stimulant use can be
different for example drink prep i think
most people use more stimulants than
they do during the off season
and so they can be confounders but it's
still a good metric to track to see okay
what sort of body weight or body fat
range am i most healthy in in terms of
blood pressure for me personally i've
found that my blood pressure is at its
best in a healthy range both
systolically and diastolically um in the
sort of 95 to 100 kilogram range
much above 100 kilograms or 220 pounds
and my systolic blood pressure gets
above 120 consistently
and much below 95 and i actually get an
issue where my systolic blood pressure
is fine
but my diastolic blood pressure is low
as of this recording
around three weeks out from my show
i pretty consistently have
very healthy systolic blood pressure so
it's around 105
but my diastolic blood pressure is
around
55 or 50
which is outside the healthy range of 60
to 90. sorry about that there's a siren
and they're having a great time
um
and so as far as blood pressure is
concerned it would seem like in the off
season
health-wise i would be pretty well off
in the sort of 95 to 100 kilogram range
plus or minus few kilograms i wanted to
um and that would make me quite healthy
next i think prep can be useful for
assessing side effects and sort of
establishing
what a sustainable body fat ranges for
you
for me personally up until about 10
weeks out from my show
roughly when i came back from my
holidays essentially um
i was not experiencing many side effects
from prep or from having a
body fat that was too low
that was around the time i was maybe
to 95 kilograms
um
past that point is when i started
experiencing
side effects like
having some depressed depression come
back having
more irritability than usual being
hungry a lot more food focus more body
image concerns and so forth
and so
obviously once again there are
confounders like if you've been dieting
for
20 weeks then
it's hard to discern or delineate
whether you're experiencing the side
effects from cutting for that long or
from just existing that body fat and
body weight
but that being said i think much below
93 or 94 probably isn't good for me
psychologically and
in terms of side effects like hunger and
food focus body image and so forth
and so once again the range of maybe
around
assuming i'm maintaining or massing 93
to
100 102 kilograms seems like a pretty
good range
and so i think
the second way in terms of health how
prep can inform your offseason is
looking at side effects you get at
various body fat percentages
or various
um
body weights
next up i think can also inform you on
being a more accurate judge of your own
body fat if you know what you look like
during prep as you reach lower and lower
body fat percentages
in the off season it becomes a lot
easier to make an estimated guess
estimated yes educated guess
as to how much body fat you're carrying
in my case for example i estimate my
stage weight is going to be around
maybe slightly below 200 pounds
um or 90 kilograms
and if i
you know just as a rough estimate assume
that my body fell around then should be
around 45 percent
um i can then have a pretty good idea
when the body fat is
and once again that would sort of
make me think that
i should be around
maybe ten percent nine percent somewhere
between eight and twelve percent broadly
speaking
at around 95 kilograms or 210 pounds
and then
i should be around 100 kilograms or 102
kilograms roughly
which is around 220 225 pounds
when i'm around 15 body fat at least
right now with my current amount of fat
free mass or muscle mass
and so once again for the offseason
should i want to stay in that body fat
range of say around 10 to 15 percent
um it would seem like around 95 to 100
kilograms or 210 to 220 pounds is a
pretty good range
next the final way in which i think prep
can inform your offseason as far as
health is concerned or sort of just
sustainability i suppose
would be your energy levels or sort of
how much you can
tolerate being physically active yeah
sorry my cat is interrupting me
um
so yeah energy levels can also vary
throughout prep and it can give you some
information on
where you're going to be most
comfortable have the best sessions and
so forth and once again my energy levels
were pretty good until i reached about
10 weeks out which for me was around
210 pounds or 95 kilograms
but afterwards is when my energy levels
and my sessions and my overall energy
levels for daily steps daily tasks start
taking hit
so overall in terms of health it seems
like around
94 kilograms to 102 kilograms is a
pretty good range
and that's information that i was able
to lean throughout this prep and that's
one way in which
contest prep can then inform your
upcoming off-season or subsequent
off-season
next i want to discuss how prep can
inform your offseason in terms of areas
for improvement
now in the offseason it can sometimes be
hard to tell what your weak points are
from a bodybuilding perspective and so
forth
um
extra body fat can make certain body
parts look a lot bigger or lack
definition and thus make it look smaller
or because you have a big waist certain
body parts can look bigger or smaller
and so getting lean
can make it a lot more accurate as far
as
assessing your body parts and your weak
points goes
in my case it would appear as though
my chest and arms are still
the primary weak point that i have in
terms of physique
in terms of informing my
specialization phases during my
offseason
this has just confirmed the fact that i
need to spend some time specializing on
chest norms
with that said though um
that provides me with good information
on
what i should be specializing on first
and from then because i'll be staying in
a reasonable body fat range and i can
sort of know
what my physique looks like during the
off season versus doing contest prep
i will be reevaluating my weak points
every macro cycle or so
so once every
three to four meso cycles of massing
i'll be re-establishing what my weak
points are
for example it's very possible that
after
one or two macro cycles of specializing
on chest and arms
i then decide okay
my chest and arms come a long way but
now my shoulders and back
or weaker body parts
and then i can reestablish what my
priority should be and
go from there
next up
after health and areas for improvement
i think the third category of how prep
can inform your offseason
is feedback from judges
not every federation does this to the
same extent or at all really
but the wnbf does provide feedback from
the judges after your show
you can ask for it
so
i'll be asking for feedback from judges
regarding what i could have done better
what was good what was bad and so forth
and so it's very possible that
you know there's a few different types
of feedback you can get
some of which you can address during the
offseason some of which you can't
i think the most common type of feedback
after a show
would be
either
not conditioned enough so body fat was
too high or you messed up your peak that
sort of thing
or you lacked muscularity overall so you
just lacked
muscle mass compared to your competitors
and that's why you didn't do well
or
the i think less common feedback would
be specific body parts need walk
like for example let's say in my case i
might have a slightly weaker upper body
compared to my lower body
overall
and so they might say yeah for some
better symmetry and better flow to your
physique
you might want to consider bringing up
your upper body especially or people
could also get feedback that your rear
side wasn't as muscular as your front
side so for example i think matt ogus
for the ogs that used to watch madogas
in like 2015 2012 whatever
um he got the feedback from
judges and from eric helms that
his
back shots so his rear bicep re-relaxed
and
relaxed bread just weren't as strong as
his front poses
likely because you know
bigger quads bigger chests bigger front
delts and so forth but then relatively
weaker hamstrings back
and so forth
and then the final area of feedback i
think that is generally given
and it's probably the least common from
what i've seen
would be that your opposing leads work
i think in my case while posing won't be
ideal
um it'll be pretty good like it won't be
the thing that needs the most work
so
in terms of what feedback you get that
can then inform your offseason obviously
if the feedback is hey you just weren't
lean enough there's not a whole lot you
can do about that in the offseason
except for maybe start your
next contest prep at a lower body fat or
make sure you're in a better position to
start the contest prep
but then the rest of the feedback can be
pretty informative
so if it's posing i think typically
that's also best addressed during prep
as long as you spend enough time
improving your posing and playing to
your strengths
that can be done during prep
but then the muscularity feedback is
really where it's at as far as informing
your offseason goes
for example if my feedback turns out to
be
you didn't have enough muscle overall
okay that just means overall i need to
spend roughly
equal amounts of time training
everything uh and just bring everything
up because i didn't have enough muscle
overall
and so i might switch between
specialization phases for chest and arms
and then for a macro cycle to back and
doubts
and then for a micro cycle do legs and
repeat until i do my next show or until
i realize there's a glaring weakness in
my physique
um
alternatively if the feedback is oh
your chest and arms were weak body parts
compared to the rest like your side
chest and side tricep poses were pretty
weak
then in that case you can also say okay
let's spend a few micro cycles mostly
specializing on chest and arms to bring
those up
so that next time you compete you can
have a better chance at placing better
finally if they just say oh your
uh
side poses or your front poses or your
rear poses just weren't as good as
everyone else's and that's weight in
place as well
in that case you can also
base your off-season plans
on that feedback so
for example in my case i think
my front poses might be my weakest
because i have fairly smaller arms and
my chest isn't quite as big as the rest
in my side poses i can sort of get away
with it by decent posing but for my
front door but i suppose my
front lat spread and my most muscular
poses i think i can sometimes appear a
bit smaller than what i expect my
competition is going to look like
i haven't really been following my
competition too closely so it's hard to
tell
but it's possible that i'll get that
feedback so if they say yep your front
poses need some work
then i'll spend time mostly training my
chest arms
front doubts perhaps
and maybe my quads if they also think my
quads are a weak point and potentially
my calves if my calves really are that
weaker body part
but overall feedback from the judges can
help inform your
plans for the offseason
now
in terms of how
my offseason is structured thus far
because i've made some
plans in the past few weeks
i'll be
bulking or maintaining for the six
months following my show
at this point i am carrying a lot of
diet fatigue and a lot of countless
fatigue like i have low energy i'm
irritable
quite irritable uh to not use any strong
language
and
overall life has just taken a hit
and so for me to sort of get back to a
more comfortable point
the plan is to run a recovery diet
wherein in the first month or so i'm
probably gonna regain around
three to six percent of my body weight
which is around three to six kilograms
or
seven to 14 pounds ish give or take
um
and then after that first month of
rebounding in weight and eating a lot of
food and hopefully getting back into a
more comfortable body fat range as far
as
both my physiological health concerned
and my psychological health concern
and also just sort of lifestyle overall
where
um up until around 10 weeks out from my
show i was still able to be quite
sociable as far as eating out went as
far as staying out etc
but then
once i dropped past that i couldn't and
so the first month is really just gonna
be a phase where i regain around
seven to fourteen pounds to get back
into that more comfortable range and
sort of put out the fire um that was
burning and wrecking my body during prep
during the last around 10 weeks
but then from there the plan is to
mostly mass for another five months with
some brief maintenance phases drop
fatigue or to allow for some holidays
for christmas and that sort of thing
and so overall over six months i'll be
going from around 90 kilograms or 200
pounds to
around 100 kilograms or 220 pounds
so get around 20 pounds or 10 kilograms
across six months
by the end of that hopefully my contest
per fatigue should be
non-existent and i should be ready to
do a mini cut or do a full cut to get
back down to around 95 kilograms or 210
pounds
and then continue massing from that i
don't have any plans competing again for
a while
unless my life situation
really
is in a position where i can compete
well successfully without it hitting or
impacting my life too much
unless that happens and or i do quite
well at this show and i enjoy the
process a lot
unless that happens i'll probably just
stick to an off season for a few years
anyways we're reaching the end of the
video
um you saw me do some super sets and
some intensity techniques you saw me do
some occlusion training for my biceps
now you're seeing me do some occlusion
training for my triceps it's just some
fun stuff that keeps training from being
too monotonous you also saw me doing
some super sets for quads and side belts
specifically city squats into hack
squats which was rough
and
lateral raises into upright rows again
just to break off the monotony it also
looks cool as you'll see now
doing bfr training can make your
vascularity pop out a little bit and it
can be fun to see that deep into prep
especially when getting a pump can be a
bit more of a challenge
[Music]
so yeah
that about wraps up this video if you
enjoyed it please leave a comment like
subscribe it does help out the channel
um
a video will be coming out soon with
physique update so i'll be going through
all the poses so you can see what i look
like at around
three weeks out
and yeah that'll be it i'll see you
again next week
