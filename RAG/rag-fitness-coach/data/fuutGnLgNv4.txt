the conversation me Nick we're just
having was basically about
how the controlled eccentric training in
the LinkedIn position
that stretch mediated hypertrophy is
being shown more and more to have the
largest magnitude of effect on muscle
growth and virtual speed
so you're going to notice we really
control the hell out of these e-centrics
especially on stuff like this hip hinges
like Peck flies things that are super
long range of motion with a really hard
eccentric
awesome exercises to really get your
Technique down and focus on that that
basically rep Cadence if you get the
rough Cadence down on these and you can
really control your hip hinging motions
you'll be fine everywhere else

oh yeah

you're probably sore man you haven't
done hit pinches in a while
