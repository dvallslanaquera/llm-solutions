I'll just use straps and anything I need
to even hypothetically get a small
benefit from as Angus Bradley recently
put it if you can RDL without straps or
do back training without straps it's not
that your grip is strong it's that your
back and hamstrings are weak if you've
been training for more than say 6 or 12
months you should probably be using
straps on all of your deadlift work most
if not all of your back work ultimately
whenever you're doing a compound
movement like the RDL or like a row or
like a pull down or a pullup you're not
really trying to train your forearms off
optimally if you were you'd be doing
wrist curls so try and maximize the
stimulus that your back gets by having
it it be the limiting factor versus your
fors don't be silly use SLS
