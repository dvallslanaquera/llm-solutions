[Music]
that was bullshit do it again
slow
chest down
control
down
yes good three more
[Music]
hey youtube i'm dr mike that's jared
feather this is elise
bohus
bois yes boas
oh boss
so she is a theory competitor she is six
weeks out for an impending show and she
is training upper body that's mostly
pull focused with a little bit of
pushing a bit of side delts and a bit of
biceps coach jared wrote the program uh
he doesn't really know what he's doing
but he's sort of cobbled together
something that looks halfway decent i
don't know how to read so i sort of
halfway read it
i think elise is going to know we're
really doing better than we are and uh
we're going to narrate we're going to
explain we're going to train
how are you feeling awesome
that was very loud all right jared
anything to say uh i would say stuff in
that good guys but you don't want to
hear me talk
jared has uh bronchitis or something so
he's gonna die soon and he can't speak a
lot in any case you ready to work yeah
let's do it one two three team
[Music]
all right so the first exercise is gonna
be pull downs in her program elise
actually has assisted pull-ups but she's
traveling she doesn't live in vegas she
doesn't train here
so
it's a decent modification it's a decent
replacement ideally of course it'd be an
assisted pull-up but pull-downs are
essentially a very similar movement
pattern if not almost the same
and
how the big question is okay i don't
have my same machine and even let's say
you're doing pull-downs but it's at a
different gym the cable stack is a
different weight
the connections all have different
resistance the friction is different so
you're like well i don't know how strong
i'm in this machine how do i pick a load
easy you just pick a load as you warm up
to target the same rep range so let's
say you're doing a system pull-ups in
the 15 to 20 rep range on a first set
you just warm up and fucks around with
weight for the pull down and a
replacement exercise in which you can
get roughly 15 to 20 reps on a first set
it shouldn't be that hard to figure out
if you've been lifting weights for some
time and then that's how you select your
load and you go from there because the
most important part physiologically that
your muscles receive about the stimulus
of course the movement pattern but
different movement pattern
next most important thing is the load
slash reps and that you can essentially
almost nail you don't have to say well i
did 100 pounds last week 17 reps this
week any machine i'm on i have to do 100
pounds
for 18 reps or 105 pounds for
you know 17 reps it doesn't have to be
that precise if you just get into that
similar rep range the overload still
happens is it ideal by a small margin no
but only by very small margin on the
other hand it's a little bit of an
injection of variation so maybe that
even cancels out it's nothing to worry
about just get into that same rep range
or similar rep range and you're good to
go let's see what elise has to do as far
as training
[Music]
way to stretch that one that was awesome
control that eccentric
[Music]
that was really good thank you really
good coming from you it means a lot
yeah i say this every now and again but
if jared and i walk into a random gym
and we see some guy who's really strong
doing partials we just like
turn around but like if we see someone
who's like well you're in super fucking
good shape so you have all the things
going for you if you see someone like
not remotely trained but they're doing
incredible technique we just like we'll
literally come up to them be like who
taught you how to do that
like well blah blah blah dude you're
doing great like i've had a conversation
with old ladies like that
slow
stretch
controlling eastenders good stuff
[Music]
that's it
[Music]
so you guys will notice that elise is
leaving quite a few reps in the tank
that is on purpose
she is in week one of her metal cycle
this is the first session and a lot of
you have asked like well if you guys say
don't train to failure all the time how
come you train a failure time in your
videos well because mostly it's peak
week training because honestly that's
like the most fun and that's what people
want to see on youtube and it's good to
be able to see that but here's one of
these videos that's at least in week one
you'll notice she's talking with price
rental tank that's on purpose
all right so if anyone doesn't see this
comment and comments below soon
she's like five ira what the fuck feel
free if you read this comment the shit
on them write in their own comments but
politely
there you go good stuff
[Music]
anymore
[Music]
good pump good pump yeah good stuff
warmed up
[Music]
all right finish pull downs
now it is time for cambered bar rose
if you're cool with the gym owner poke
poke poke ass ass ask for that person to
get you a cambered bar at the gym or
just buy it yourself it's like 300 bucks
it's amazing it allows you an unreal
range of motion in a row and everything
in your upper back even your lower back
blows up at the same time a crazy
pre-contraction
big ass stretch no sweetie no bs elise
is a technique goddess
watch this that's a 10 to 20 reps
ah
i can't wait
stand a little bit more upright
just like that yes
yes now you're rolling chest up at the
bottom yes
chest up
oh yeah
good keep going these are great
chest up
just like that chest stop
three more big chest
one chest up
[Music]
so when i say chest up at the bottom
when you're coming down it's easy to do
this we don't want you to do that okay
we want you to protract your shoulders
that's great but keep your chest sky
high
touch chest up
like that it's going to pull your whole
back out for you
dig back out boom chest up it's gonna
want to do this to you don't let it okay
just like that that was perfect chest
[Music]
chest two more
one more chest
yeah
that's it
oh these are bitch feel it back there oh
yeah good
like should i be
kind of parallel to the deck
parallel like my body a little above
parallel right there

[Music]
chest stop

[Music]
get one more one more one more chest up
fuck yeah fuck yeah that's it good job
yes i know that was really good that was
really good
[Music]
all right lap prayer time
prayer is good it's a nice thing to do
to talk to god but you might as well get
jacked while you're at it so
a couple of good technique cues and lap
prayers
is
as you come up for the eccentric you
want your torso to lower so you can get
a big stretch so instead of doing them
stationary which is fine a slightly
perhaps enhanced way of doing them
enhanced
is as you go down
stretch into it gently come up
stretch into it now notice i'm only
coming up to here that's because my shit
is in the way and everything i'm not
warmed up if i get an appropriate amount
of weight i can really go up what you
want is an unreal stretch at the top
that fucks the light up gets us
everything we want multiple sets of 10
to 20 reps where's elise at

was really condescending
you guys want to see oh yeah those are
the same spot away from the pokemon
that's a big show that you were at
i did okay
this exercise is amazing for the traps
the side belts and the rear dots i want
you guys to watch something from this
camera angle when she does her set her
rear delt sorry is it okay if i do that
absolutely her rear delt is right here
watch it visibly shorten by like
two-thirds of its length it's crazy

these are a bitch yeah they're heavy
i do that exercise with the 20s so
yeah i usually do it with 12 and a half
but i was feeling extra today
[Music]
strict technique is a huge premium here
we do these jared style or she does
anyway i'm not flexible enough anymore
where you keep your elbows in hard
and you arc the bar towards your face
unbelievable always your control no
bobbing and weaving with the rest of
your body
elise is a technique
mistress master feminine and she's gonna
do a fucking great job watch this and
just in general all of jared's clients
seem to have really good technique well
i'm kicking rocks around because i don't
have any clients
oh my god these are flawless
do not lean over this is not a glute
exercise
now we're talking
[Music]
two more

[Music]
oh man those are so good
folks comment every now and again on my
training videos that they're like asmr
because all the technique is so like
smooth and shit like that
ah whatever i think my training is fine
i'm watching elise right now i'm
forgetting to give her technique tips
because she first of all doesn't need
any and second of all i'm just like that
peak contraction i'm like oh fucking
beautiful it's like tasting a pasta dish
oh yo whoa whoa whoa
[Music]
supposed to be hard
[Music]
one more
make it good
no bullshit yes go go go and slow on the
way down
that's it oh wow what's next
that's it
you didn't have an incline press or
something like that oh yeah oh yeah
goddammit am i the only one memory here
[Music]
[Applause]
all right this is the last intro i'll
ever make because i'm thinking fuck this
youtube shit i'm gonna get my rap career
started but while i'm still at this one
last exercise elise actually only trains
four days a week because she has a super
important job and she can only change so
much so she has to mix push and pull a
lot of these are pull emphasis with a
little bit of push and then the other
way around so she's just doing one
exercise incline smith machine press
pretty high incline actually to get a
lot of upper chest and shoulders and
triceps why high incline she's a figure
and the figure they don't reward like
big ass muscle titties like they do in
my division
men's figure so she's gonna do multiple
sets oh
around
10 reps each plus or minus and watch the
technique and watch her shoulders and
upper back
fuck control that eccentric
[Music]
slow
