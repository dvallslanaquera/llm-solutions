hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization i have a question for you
should you be wearing a lifting belt
maybe good news we also have answers
here we go
for strength and hypertrophy training is
a lifting belt a good idea
we're actually going to break down the
discussion into a couple of sub points
first what does a belt
do goes over your body
we know that but what does it do
physiologically anatomically so on and
so forth and that's going to have
implications for when it's a good idea
when it's a bad idea
then we're going to talk about when a
belt is not a good idea when it's a
great idea
and what kind of belt is good especially
depending on your training age so here
we go
what does a belt do fundamentally a belt
increases your intra-abdominal pressure
and
it does this when you put it on for
lifting and it does it especially if you
know how to brace into the belt
so if you have a belt on it should be
nice and tight then you breathe in
and you push out against the belt it's
like pushing out against your own abs
except now your abs are unbreakable
and that allows the internal pressure
your intra-abdominal intrathoracic so on
and so forth
all that pressure to be much higher by
itself that sounds like a neat trick
that has no point whatsoever
but increase in intra-abdominal pressure
has some really really cool effects
first it allows for more spinal
stability at any given load which
automatically at a very high load
reduces the chance of injury or reduces
the chance
that your technique sort of skirts off
and you have lower power production then
you miss a repetition so first benefit
secondly in an interesting pathway when
you have a high degree of spinal
stability because of a high degree of
intra-abdominal pressure from the belt
what actually ends up happening is your
nervous system
allows more neural drive to go to the
periphery
for example if you put on a belt and you
brace properly into it
the amount of force you can generate
with your quads glutes and hamstrings
actually goes up
when your body detects a huge amount of
spinal stability
and a huge amount of intra abdominal
pressure causing that it actually
sort of disinhibits its own neural drive
to the quads glutes hams etc
and now you can push and pull harder
with your legs the same effect also also
works for your upper body but it really
works well with your legs
when your body especially for your legs
detects spinal instability
it caps how much of neural drive it
sends to your legs and then you can't
push as hard as you otherwise would
ultimate example of this is when you're
squatting on a bosu ball and
everything's wiggly
you literally can't produce a whole lot
of force with your legs
putting on a belt is the polar opposite
of squatting on a bosu ball it makes
everything rigid
tight in your spinal columns just like
this your body can tell
and it allows higher forces to be
transmitted which means
you could lift more with a belt than
without a belt
and that means that you also get
potentially better stimulus
to the local muscles like your quads can
get
literally more out of every set because
you can contract them harder
more fully than you would without a belt
without that extra added stability
now this is especially true if you're
used to wearing the belt you put on a
belt for the first
two three or four times look it feels
weird it's off it may be pinching into
you
there's usually no enhancement with a
one-time two or three time belt use
but as you learn to use the belt your
performance with the belt
can really really notably elevate
allowing you to stimulate those muscles
of the lower body especially
upper body as well more and to do so
safely and produce higher forces so on
and so forth
in addition if your core is a limiting
factor on your lifts
a belt can reduce the limiting factor of
your core
what do we mean by this let's say you
can leg press a fuck ton with really
good technique because your legs are
really really strong
but every time you do squats your core
your back let's say is what's
interfering
you may be able to do with your legs 12
reps but you stop at like eight reps
because you just start to fold over be
sure to feel really weak because your
core is super weak
if you put on a belt nice and tight and
you know how to use it
it buys you two three four more reps
before your core gets weak again because
it reinforces your core
and all of a sudden you can get closer
to actual leg failure within a set
than just having it limited by the core
because people be like hey you stop that
set of squats you're one from fail do
your legs feel like they're getting hit
like honestly i
fucking don't like it's just my back
gets tired and i start folding over my
force production goes down i can't do
any more reps
you throw on a belt you learn how to use
it all of a sudden someone says hey how
was that set you're like dude it was
fucking awesome
my core didn't prevent me from um doing
more reps
like my legs are failing now they're the
limiting factor which is great because
you get so much more out of your leg
tree
all right now putting on a belt
has effects on core musculature you
might be thinking like look if you're
throwing on a belt
isn't that a crutch you're right to a
certain extent so at any absolute given
load
200-pound squat 200-pound squat without
a belt
core muscle activity is pretty high with
the belt it's lower
you think fuck if i use a belt
at 200 pounds both times i'm going to
actually be making my core muscles even
weaker
making the problem worse true however
remember
a belt allows you to lift more weight so
if
as a relative percent of your max let's
say 200 pounds something you could do
for sets of 10
without a belt the real comparison isn't
to say how core muscle activity does
with 200 pounds the answer is less if
you put on a belt
the real comparison is okay your 10rm is
200
fine core muscle activity is a certain
level what if we
check with your 10rm with the belt on
okay now after you learn how to use your
belt
your 10 rep max isn't 200 anymore with a
belt it's still 200 without a belt
with the belt it's 225 right or
something like that
now what's your core muscle activity
then it's the same
so your core muscle activity if you're
trying just as hard
is the same with a belt or without a
belt so if you're trying super hard
and not just using a belt as a literal
crutch to just get the same reps you
used to except with that one
if you're really pushing yourself as
hard as you ever were the belt
doesn't make your core muscles any
weaker it makes them just as strong
as lifting without a belt did period
really really cool
right now lastly another thing you can
expect with the belt and this is a big
deal
is an ever so slight but notable change
in technique
right it's going to take a bit to get
used to a lot of times people throw on a
belt for the first time and they do a
squat and like what the fuck like their
butt shoots back further
a lot of times what people will do is
they'll flex or extend the spine as they
get lower in a squat for example
and now that flexion or extension
because you have a belt around you is
not really possible
that your back is now more of a rigid
segment so
instead of you know having your knees
come up this way and you'll be able to
flex and extend into it
now you're rigid your knees do this and
you're like what the shit
so it's definitely something that takes
some easing into don't just assume it's
this magic tool that instantly makes you
stronger
some people are lucky and that's the
effect they get for most people the
first time they put on a belt they may
actually get weaker
during that session than usual because
their technique is thrown off so
remember that that's a really really big
deal
to that effect when is a belt a bad idea
okay first bad idea for a belt is after
peripheral injury
okay if you hurt your quad or you hurt
your adductor
throwing on a belt is just going to let
you put higher forces through your
quadrant adductor and that's a terrible
terrible idea
you don't need to put high forces you
need to put low forces so the belt is
really kind of completely pointless at
this point
worse than pointless it can give you a
false sense of confidence and then you
get hurt again
bad news second for beginners people
that have been only lifting for
uh you know one to three years maybe one
to two belt isn't a good idea because we
need to have them establish core
awareness
learn how to brace properly using their
own abs
and establish really good technique in
way too early reliance on a belt
can never teach you how to brace so if
you ever take your belt off you are
fucking useless
and you have no idea how to do anything
and everything feels super super weird
also when you're relatively weak which
all of us are more beginners you don't
need a fucking belt
for safety or for anything else right
you just don't
so in beginners highly recommended
there's no belt used whatsoever
that answers probably a bunch of your
questions
next when you're preparing for a
non-belt exertion
if you have an uh you know if you're
trying to test your beltless max in your
deadlift or you have a competition in
which a belt is not allowed or something
like that
why in god's name would you wear a belt
you get used to wearing a belt then when
you actually
do the exertion itself the competition
whatever is showing off
you don't get to wear a belt it throws
you off it's really crazy it's nothing
good you don't really ever train
especially in a peaking phase with
anything you can't use in competition or
in showing off so
if you've got like beltless deadlift
effort coming up for the next month
take the belt off don't use it at all
for the deadlift really really really
good idea
next one point d
when you want to train your core as the
limiting factor in a compound move
especially without needlessly fatigue in
the periphery don't wear a belt
so for example some people will do
overhead squats to get more core
stability they're using the overhead
squat
to enhance their core strength and
stability it's really great for that
actually
if you throw out a belt you just have to
use more weight in your hands
and then your shoulders hurt more your
legs are struggling more
you're not really training course you're
still training core stability but at a
bigger expense
if you don't throw on a belt you get
just as much core stability training but
with less external load
safety is actually up so on and so forth
so
if you really want your core to get
stronger and stronger and stronger
as a focus of your training and you
don't care about your periphery as much
in that time
don't use a belt right next one and this
is a huge one i've made this mistake a
bunch
if you've been training without a belt
and a competition is coming up very soon
or it's the day of the competition do
not throw on a belt
because there is a lag time for learning
how to use it in most cases
look if it's your last deadlift attempt
and you look at your coaching like i
just don't
you know i want to get this attempt
maybe you missed the second to last one
and you're just like look i don't know
we got to pull rabbit out of a hat
is it okay to roll the dice and try a
belt sure sure
are the dice always going to come up on
the right side no like sometimes you put
on a belt you start pulling on it like
this is a fucking disaster and sometimes
you're like oh it gave me a little bit
of an edge a little bit of a placebo
effect too as well
but generally speaking if you've got a
competition coming up or some kind of
effort where you're showing off
don't throw on a belt last minute that's
a really really terrible idea right it
oftentimes hurts more than helps
lastly for very high reps the belt is
usually not recommended
because it makes your breathing more
difficult and it also uh sometimes
restricts blood flow to and
from the legs so it's a real bad deal so
if you're doing uh
reps of 20 plus like i see people doing
sets of
15 20 25 reps on a leg press and they
have a belt on the fucking god
god's name are you doing and they're
like man it's really hard to breathe no
fucking shit you take the belt off and
you can breathe again
you actually get more reps uh this is
something i've encountered many many
times
with hack squats and stuff sometimes
i'll use a belt and since you're really
tight
and when i do sets of 20 i'm like i'm
like
this isn't my legs anymore i physically
can't fucking breathe i take the belt
off and each rep feels harder
because obviously it's lower in term
abdominal pressure but i get more reps
right
if the point is to get lots of reps
ta-da kind of a self-solving problem
for those of you more advanced you can
modulate this problem
incrementally by just cinching your belt
not as tight or tighter so if you've got
high reps coming up
you can keep your belt on but since
you're less tight but just know that
this is a thing
no to expect all right
when is a belt a good idea first when
your core is limiting your periphery
like you're doing squats and lunges or
overhead presses
and you know you're not failing because
of your actual target muscles you're
failing because your core gets tired
gets weak and throws you out of position
if that's the case and you really want
bigger quads or bigger shoulders or
whatever you're actually targeting
throwing on a belt on is a really really
good idea especially if you get a lot on
the belt
and if you don't get a lot off a belt a
lot of times it's learning how to use
the belt properly which takes weeks and
weeks and then eventually like oh my god
the belt is really doing wonders for me
okay so that's a really good use
next if your core cumulative fatigue is
limiting your periphery
so yeah you can actually do really well
without a belt
but you're doing stiff like a deadlift
deadlift bent rows squats
overhead presses all the shit in the
same week and you're noticing like your
core
like your back and everything your abs
your your obliques
they're getting really tired and over
time not only one session but over time
you're training degrades because your
core is holding it back
if you throw on a belt every now and
again and just do the same sets and reps
you normally would
yeah that actually fatigues your core
less and
you end up doing really well with it
because the core isn't limiting the rest
of your program on a systemic level so
sometimes you see people
doing a belt on a bent row and you're
like what are you doing like you don't
need a belt for the bent mode totally
but for them it just takes the stress
off their core just a little bit of
course we could accomplish that with
just doing machines or something
but sometimes a belt is good just to
take it easy on your core when you know
your course limiting factor in a
cumulative sense
next this is kind of a no-brainer when
you're training for a competition
andy belt is allowed okay duh
it's usually a good idea it's a big
advantage in most cases try to think of
how many
times you've seen world's strongest man
i highly recommend you watch it if you
haven't
and they have that like 700 pound
pre-fixed squat
gigantic barbell challenge thing where
they do as many squats with like 700 or
whatever as possible
think of how many of the guys don't use
a belt almost everyone uses belt because
it's just a fucking big deal as a matter
of fact in strongman
they often have custom belts that are
much wider and thicker than regular
belts
because it's that big of a deal it's a
huge deal so if you have the opportunity
to use it use it
sometimes you see people breaking world
records and stuff not as often world
records competing at national meets
with no belt and like squad or deadlift
and you think like damn
do we not need a belt no that person
probably just like hasn't figured some
shit out yet
a really good example of uh by analogy
is i remember the
eric lillabridge i believe used to squat
high bar in competition and everyone
kind of knew biomechanically low bar was
better
and he was like nope highbar feels good
for me and he was breaking tons of
records doing him
and people were like see eric does it
like fucking high bar is the way to go
low bars and myth is fucking stupid
and then he transitioned to low bar and
within like a period of like six months
added like 200 pounds to a squat okay
nothing else really changed
and people were like huh god damn it so
low bar works better
and having a belt works better which is
why almost every squat world record is
broken low bar
with a fucking belt so sometimes there's
kind of a pride we have
like fuck i don't need a belt if you
want your best possible performance
about this is a really really good idea
and some people say you know does a belt
reduce injury risk if you keep the loads
to what they normally are
it almost certainly reduces your risk to
the area that it directly
supports so if you have kind of a back
injury or something like that
can you throw on a belt and still have
normal workouts sometimes yes so that's
the last point when you can lift
pain-free
with a belt but you can't without one
however that's a short-term fix
with something to maybe get you through
the end of a mesocycle or something like
let's say you have smith machine squats
and it's week five of a five-week
progression and on week four you kind of
dinged your back a little bit and you're
like uh
and you were doing them beltless and you
throw on a belt for week five
and you do your warm-ups and you're like
oh actually this feels fucking great
let's see how it feels without a belt
you try a warm without a belt you're
like out fuck that
throw the belt back on finish your sets
with the hat with the uh smith machine
squad
finish that out but don't be like a
permanent thing don't be like ever since
i heard my back i can't
can't squat without a belt like holy
fuck that's a real serious injury
sometimes that's permanent and sometimes
you always have to have the belt
very rarely usually a belt is a fine
band-aid
for a short time and eventually have to
transition off of it get your injury
diagnosed
get it fixed asap so you can have a
choice of where to go beltless or not
not just be stuck with a belt all the
time all right
lastly what kind of belt is good well i
have my own belt company drmiksbelts.net
don't go on that website that's not a
real website it may very well be
pornography so it's not safe for work
here's the deal it's a real good idea if
you've never had a belt before to start
with a fabric belt or a velcro
belt because it's easy to adjust it's
easy to get used to it's not this crazy
thing if you start with a
like a real power lifting belt i mean
you can shoot a gun into that shit it
won't go through
and if you put it on really tight
sometimes it pushes up against your ribs
pushes into your hips
it hurts it's weird it really changes
your your mechanics for lifting because
it keeps that
lower spinal segment super rigid and you
may be used to some movement in there
which is fine
so as a transitional tool a fabric belt
is a really great idea
a reband makes a fine product um vallejo
makes a fine product
just one of those like just like little
belts that you can bend really easy
they're usually black in color and like
about this wide
get one of them shits they're usually
velcro and just start putting on a belt
in training if you're into that sort of
thing and you want someone out
and then eventually tighten tighten
tighten and then after a few months
you're tightening it really tight and
you feel like sometimes when you really
brace against it the velcro starts to
slip
and you're really comfortable you're
really used to it that's when
you're getting a lot out of it but it's
time to transition to a serious belt and
a serious belt
is usually a power lifting belt and it's
usually a certain width certain
thickness
and most folks interested in the very
best results will transition to that
belt
bodybuilders included should be using a
real serious belt
if they're real serious about training
in most cases and
especially a single prong belt is a good
idea single prong belt means it has just
one of these prong latches
and then you close it just with a single
prong y because if you're blowing all
your air out and you're trying to close
two prongs
sometimes you close one and then it
fulcrums away and then closing the
others like mechanically impossible so
you have to peel off the
one and try to guide two prongs in at
the same time fuck all that
single prong belt is like you know what
is that like reddit term the
master race of belts or whatever uh a
single prong belt is
is the shit single prong polishing belt
you put it on
get it as tight as you can or as tight
as is comfy and then all of a sudden
it's easy to
to put on easy to take off wonderful
wonderful product
um i have a super interesting custom
made belt which is double wide
because god decided to make me wrong and
gave me like a six foot five person's
torso with
the arms and legs of a five foot three
person
i'm i'm five six in reality guys but in
any case i'm built all fucking weird so
for me an extra wide belt works really
well
i got it custom made by a company called
pioneer check them out on instagram
whatever other media they have
pioneers awesome super high quality
products i'm not sponsored they don't
pay me fucking shit
i paid actual real money for that belt
uh but it's great quality product great
people that run it so give a pioneer
belt or any other of the great companies
in that space of thought
and you don't have to get your belt
super custom although pioneer doesn't
make custom belts
but just get a good belt make sure you
got the velcro belt first
it's weird to me when people have been
training for two years and the first
belt they get is like a reinforced
like ceramic belt that they can't even
move and they're like oh man i guess i
just gotta wiggle into it like you
should be waving the velcro first
so take your time ease in use a belt for
what it's good for
don't use it for what it's not good for
and if you have any questions comments
concerns
type them into the uh into the comments
and uh hopefully we'll make a follow-up
video if anything is unclear
guys enjoy your belt of lifting use your
powers for good see you next time
you
