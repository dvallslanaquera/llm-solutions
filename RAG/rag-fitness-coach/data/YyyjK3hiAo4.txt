stay there don't go anywhere Jordan
don't reach for that handle
[Music]
I wish I got an arm pump or something
you can just stand in front of us
you make me look small guys no no you
said like a little bit in front of us I
only have king size brother yeah
folks I'm Dr Mike
that's Jared feather ifb Pro we are in
Montreal Canada
in Atlantis gym they think about
corporate structures because all
corporations almost all have a CEO a
chief executive officer and this is
genre
and he just happens to be the CEO of
Atlantis and it's one of these
situations where like you guys know how
like in all the like Spider-Man is shit
comic movies the the guy the CEO of the
company that has all the defense
contractor nanotech bugs at some point
he's like ah fuck Spider-Man I'm using
my own shit well Sheldon had a little
altercation outside here just a little
while ago I didn't want to talk about it
I was in the elevator guy pushed him he
pushed him back he's like and Jordan's
like enough enough being mortal enough
and then he's like what is it I do for a
living oh that's right I make the
world's best exercise equipment to make
me jacked and mean he said make me mean
how do you say that in French what do
you say make me mean in French
it was it just it Jared and I were like
we can't not help you so he hired us as
defense contractor defense contractors
leg day hamstrings quads glutes
CEO of Atlantis on his own equipment and
uh it looks like it's gonna be a very
easy
surgery
operation to install the Nano lasers and
stuff it'll be great
how are you feeling
good I just had pre-workout just making
sure I could get through it but uh we'll
get you through it yeah one way or
another in support yeah oh please all
right you guys ready to see this three
two one
shopping that's how we get big shop our
way to size
shopping for Trent I guess
really control the e-sensor and pause
for a full stretch at the bottom all the
way down slow slow right there pause up
good how does that feel I actually don't
use this too often but this one looks
pretty nice
you want to give it a try as well want
to jump in yeah oh I can't I have uh my
my spleen uh
leg curls first we get a cool Atlantis
piece here we're using it's a single leg
leg curl works really well
you'll notice that when we start doing
these sets here towards the last couple
reps I'm going to help Jordan at the
very top
so that he can continue to complete the
Reps and get more reps in for that
bottom half of the exercise which is the
most hypertrophic this is technically
four straps it's okay to do every now
and again it's a special workout for fun
maximum stimulus the thing at RP the
reason why we don't do a lot of this
stuff is because of tracking you know
week one week two week three week four
how much is your buddy pulling on you
who the fuck knows so we usually don't
do stuff like that but this is a once in
a blue moon special CEO workout we get
after it
when you want to help the person in the
part of the range of motion that they
need to help the most in to get through
the rep so you get more reps and the
part of the range of motion that's least
hypertrophic so they can do the most
hypertrophic part for themselves this is
exactly what's happening with that top
range ship we're gonna do two sets here
about 15 reps each
he's gonna get 15 on the first and we're
gonna iron rep the rest of them he
doesn't know that yet I don't know if he
knows what my reps are you sure I should
about to find out well three more I'm
right here with you
[Music]
keep that technique nice control
[Music]
good one last one
slow
beautiful
rest a little bit relax yeah it's hard
to finish a range of motion when you get
tired yes of course yeah like squash
that's why I'm helping you at the very
top that makes sense
[Music]
the reason I'm saying keep the hip
forward is because you're putting
yourself in a more mechanically
advantageous position to like curl the
weight up which is fine but to produce a
lot of high pressure you want yourself
in a disadvantageous position so when
you're pushing your hip back as you're
going down you're just making it easier
on yourself yeah yeah when you keep your
hip forward on this as you're coming
down it's kind of like if you push your
elbows out on a bicep curl like this
instead of being here and in order to
get a huge stretch and as we know that
stretch mediated is huge you want to
keep that hit forward so the lever
length is longer
that makes sense the lever length
becomes longer unless you're here it's
shorter now so if you can keep the hip
forward and reach out you're gonna get a
way better stretch control that last bit
more slow control rest for a second
after this don't go anywhere rest
breathe
two more last two
yes
[Music]
two
and that's it
cool I think that's it for hamstrings
yeah yeah
oh yeah this one on everything
the Atlantis hack squat actually
[Applause]
[Music]
next up is the hack squat the Atlantis
hack squat because look no joke the best
hot spot I've ever used it's the
smoothest it's an adjustable plate the
plate itself is super super fucking high
friction so there's no way to like slip
off in or anything just you're like
fucking buried in there the shoulder
pads are even comfortable it's full
depth like to the max like your quads
are stretched to the Bone and uh gee
whiz we're gonna do two sets of like
10 to 20 reps my reps Style
pray for Mr Salsa C
um
how many reps ah yes we'll see
do you want a number or do you do you
want to just go
it won't matter it won't matter I'll
just write Google as far as possible I
guess cool cool
go go go one more one more get together
slow slow
pause
rest breathe
breathe just slow at the bottom knees
out knees out slow
wait

press
rap
[Music]
now it's fun yeah if shit hits the fan
and a gentleman is not able to get
enough reps to our liking with whatever
weight we have on there sometimes we
just drop it so we'll go like 225 or go
to 185 or go to 135. sometimes we even
go to there's nothing on the machine and
we'll see if that comes to pass today
[Music]
[Laughter]

even just so it goes down as though as
possible is yeah yeah I was going faster
and faster I was doing our best pause
for like seem like eternity even for me
yeah
it's like uh really
in the moment working on being a stoic
because yeah like I kept telling you the
Pain's not going anywhere just accept
that it's there yeah like you just have
to accept this is not going to feel any
fucking better no matter what because I
have to keep doing reps and there's
gonna be more of a pump more metabolites
the pain is literally just going to get
worse so like you have to like get used
to it and tell yourself that exactly
yeah
