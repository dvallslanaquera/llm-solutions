many likely agree pull-ups can be
difficult to progress
a study by sanchez mourinho and
colleagues suggest trading easier on the
pull-up might enable faster progress
29 men with two to four years of
training experience perform pull-ups
with maximal intended lifting velocities
for 2 to 4 sets twice per week for 8
weeks
group 1 perform reps until their lifting
velocity decreased by 25 percent
this corresponds to performing 50
percent of the maximum number of reps
you can
so if you could perform ten max reps
you'd only perform five
group two perform reps until their
lifting velocity decreased by fifty
percent
this corresponds to performing
eighty-five percent of the maximum
number of reps you can
so if you could perform 10 max reps
you'd perform 8 or 9
at the end of the study group 1 saw much
greater increases in pull up warner at
max and the number of maximum body
weight pull-ups they could perform
