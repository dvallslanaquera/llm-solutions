hey folks it's dr mike from renaissance
periodization and i have an interesting
list of common beginner mistakes
that you can avoid if you're a beginner
just don't make them and they'll be
great for you because they'll save you
lots of time and effort in the gym and
give you better results if you are a
personal trainer or an online coach you
can
watch this video and really learn how
training beginners works and make sure
not to the bad stuff so that all of your
potential future clients many former
beginners get the a plus service from
you the third group of folks i'm
targeting with this video is people who
involuntarily
capture other
people not even at the gym you just get
someone in a big
potato sack bag dump them in the back of
an unmarked white van and then walmart
parking lot take them to your own
private gym and they're like
please don't kill me shut up shut up
wipe those tears off your face
okay okay
you're like you're gonna work out for
the first time ever they're like what do
you mean workout you be quiet you're
gonna do lunges and squats and you're
not gonna make any of these mistakes
because i'm through with beginner
mistakes do you understand me and
they're like yeah
but then they have a fine time and
afterwards like i was actually pretty
good uh pretty good workout i might
start doing this by myself and you're
like really even after i let you go in
the water on a parking lot and they're
like yeah maybe and then after you let
them go and they wave your
cargo van away
uh you know they'll probably say like
i'm never doing that shit even though
getting kidnapped was kind of cool that
lunge squat combo
sucked it really was torture i'm filing
a police report
in any case
all that aside
at least five mistakes that i can think
of in beginner training happen so often
they are worthy of mention mistake
number one and this is super fucking
common
the beginners often
bite off more than they can chew in at
least two ways that i can think of first
their sessions are often too long
there is nothing in this world that
beginner to resistance training needs
that takes more than like 45 minutes to
do in one session
some people just start with two hour
workouts the number one reason that they
do this is the rocky balboa mentality of
i'm gonna do everything i can i'm gonna
work really hard and get tons of
benefits really quick but there's a
point of diminishing returns with
working out in one session and there's
even a point of negative returns
so that point isn't very hard to reach
for beginners it's like 45 minutes of
relatively tough activity is more than
enough when you're an intermediate when
you're really advanced
you'll need to spend more time in the
gym save that shit for when you need it
okay
so
one hour or less workouts is almost
standard for beginners and the second
thing is
a lot of people try to do lots of
sessions they're going to say oh i'm
going to get started working out i'm
going to train seven days a week no days
off and you coax them and they're like
okay six days but i'm really serious the
thing is beginners burn out like crazy
beginners burn out more predictably than
they get results
that's how predictable burnouts are
you guys have been to your gym
new year's resolution time january 1st
through january 15th or so
there's so many people in the gym like
our gym will have to expand tenfold if
it's gonna have this many members
sustainably and they never do why
because your gym and everyone else knows
except for those people that after the
first two weeks most of them are gone
and after six weeks you'll never see
anyone but three or four of those new
people again
one of the reasons that people burn
themselves out is because they set these
napoleonic goals for themselves
they're thinking
i'm gonna train six days a week for two
hours at a time
napoleon thought that he was gonna march
all the way to moscow and conquer all
that shit
vladimir putin thought that he was just
going to march into kiev she didn't work
either motherfucker
so in any case
beginners have this interesting
confluence of of fates
on the one hand they're easily burnt out
by many sessions a week
on the other hand
their stimulus sensitivity is so high
that they could just do two sessions
whole body per week and get
undifferentiably great results from
people that train four days a week for
like three weeks straight and then just
a little more volume increase and they
hang in for six weeks
why would you train more than is
necessary to get the best results the
only upside is risk of burnout so my
huge huge impetus to beginner folks
starting out
personal trainers and online coaches
that are working with beginners or about
to
and people who
go to walmart parking lots to steal
people away and make them work out
is not too many sessions
four sessions or less per week a good
place to start with many beginners is
two or three weight training sessions
per week that's it
after several months when they have
amazing results just with a tiny amount
of work if they want to do a little bit
more then you let them but they have to
ask for it because you don't want to
impose it on them because the chance of
burnout is very very high
that's the first problem
don't bite off more than the beginner
can chew which is not a lot
second inconsistency
so yes beginners need to be pulled away
from doing too many sessions or going
for too long because you don't want them
to burn out
but
whatever it is they commit to that is
within the realm of ability you have to
coax them to make sure they show up
beginners are terrible at inconsistency
and for them even as beginners
if they skip a whole week of training
here and there the results are going to
be much tougher to come by but even if
they train only twice a week and
consistently make every single week two
sessions hey that's
stable dependable great progress that
will change their physiques and their
health over time
so as a personal trainer as a coach you
want to get on your clients
psychologically
culturally at the very beginning of
training gently calmly politely
reinforcing constantly the idea of
consistency and you can tell them look
there's myths here no you don't have to
train for two hours no you have to bleed
out of your face when you train no you
don't have to train six days a week and
a lot of this news is they're going to
be like oh that's so great
and then you got to say but the sessions
you do commit to we need you here
because you can't
build a skyscraper without physically
fucking being there to build it get all
the raw materials in place it doesn't
fucking matter
you gotta do the work consistently over
and over and over again right so
skipping is no good
the client says listen i normally train
with you tuesday and friday
but this coming week wednesday i have a
business trip let's just can tuesday and
start next week
you could say hey that would work
totally well but why don't we get you in
monday so you get at least one session
that week
and they go ah fuck all right you're
right and that consistently even just
once a week maintains all of their gains
maintains their technique momentum and
when they come back the next week after
the business trip they haven't missed a
beat they just took a little pause
but if you're gone half the weeks and
there the other halfs
even for beginners training a muscle
once every two weeks may only
increase it a little bit in size and
strength and then just maintain it
indefinitely at a pathetic level of
strength and size
point three
avoiding the hard stuff remember a lot
of times beginners
don't have that juggernaut mindset if
i'll run through all the fucking pieces
of equipment in this gym if it makes me
marginally bigger or stronger
so
that's a tough attitude to just have and
a lot of stuff in the gym is easier than
the other stuff you may want to do the
nice machines with the padding you may
not want to do the barbell compound
basics the squats deadlifts bench press
overhead presses upright rows barbell
curls all that crap it hurts it sucks i
want to do the easy stuff here's the
thing the hard stuff
builds a few things we really need first
it has an incredibly high raw stimulus
magnitude in most cases which means the
bench press just builds upper body
muscle really fucking well and because
the beginner is usually so weak that
fatigue doesn't really enter the picture
much so the stimulus to fatigue ratio
just because that huge rust into this
magnitude is unreal high so as you get
bigger and stronger the compound moves
because of systemic fatigue problems
they start to not have as high of an sfr
as the other moves and eventually if
you're really advanced machines and free
weights just about equal but in the
beginning free weights really are almost
in most cases better than machines
especially for beginners because they
can take it
now
another really big benefit
is that these moves build the
fundamental technique for executing on
every other machine
if you want to know how to do a press
with your legs or a press with your arms
or a pull with your arms or some kind of
vertical pull or this way or that way
these fundamental movement patterns that
are replicated in one way shape or form
and every other exercise machines or not
they are best taught in a free weight
environment with barbells and dumbbells
and that baseline technique you show me
somebody who could do a deep controlled
squat with a barbell i'll teach them to
hack squat in two repetitions
you show me someone who's been on the
leg press for a while and never squatted
i'm gonna teach them to hack squat in i
don't know
three or four sets of wobbly bullshit
if you can competently master the
compound heavy basics you are a master
of those and all any machines you want
to use very shortly if you raise
yourself on machines
each machine doesn't transfer very well
to the other because that core
competency of moving your body and some
weight in a free space you're in charge
of all the movements all the
stabilization aspects critical
lastly
one of the really good things about the
hard stuff
the stuff that requires maintaining
balance and posture in a rigid core
under heavy load
it fucking hardens up beginners so that
they don't get hurt doing other stuff
later
i've known people
who began bodybuilding and they started
with leg extensions and leg presses
and all this machine stuff and their
quads got really big and strong
but they would always hurt their lower
backs
why because they never did anything free
weight that would challenge their lower
backs in a graded exposure to make them
stronger
if you have the lower back of a thousand
pound deadlifter let's just pretend what
the fucking bodybuilding is gonna hurt
your lower back nothing it's a joke
that's like training mma and then having
like two-year-olds punch you in the face
doesn't matter
but if you start with machines and you
never get the exposure that compound
heavy basic they require you to brace
under load and be stable and strong and
build overall resilience in the gym
you're gonna build fragile fucking
clients and you don't want any part of
that and neither do they so a real good
idea in most cases of people that are
orthopedically cleared to do the
compound basics beginners get that shit
end of the stick
squats deadlifts lunges pull-ups
barbells dumbbells all that hard fucking
shit nobody wants to do instead plug
into a pink machine with blue handles
that are soft and puffy the machine even
smells nice and it plays enya that would
be quite nice actually
turn up that engine on that machine
stand next to the machine and do fucking
barbell overhead process that'll build
some goddamn
ovaries on your body in your body
yeah
they belong somewhere of that i'm sure
again sex makes me nervous so i didn't
pay attention in class when they were
going over that stuff
don't let them avoid the hard stuff you
as a trainer do not be complicit in it
period
number four
huge problem beginners make is they
advance relative effort over technique
which in layman's terms means they're
trying to go really close to failure
and what ends up happening is their
technique sucks progressively worse with
every rep they get close to failure and
because they essentially do so many bad
technique reps every session they learn
bad technique and their technique stays
bad or gets worse over the weeks and
months of training
i've had people who have been training
with another trainer for a month or a
year
come to me to be a training client back
when i was a personal trainer with mr
nick shaw in new york city about a
decade ago
and
they would be like uh i'd ask them like
have you squatted before they'd be like
absolutely show me a squat and what they
show me is
like if van gogh did art but he did it
with like five lsds tabs and he was also
drunk and hurting himself at the time i
assume he's probably hurting himself
anyway but drunk and four lsd tabs it's
the worst thing i've ever seen in my
life
and how the fuck did they get like that
well it turns out they were taking every
sec to failure and they were never being
coached very well on technique so that
the set end up becoming like some kind
of writhing wriggling mess that you
survive instead of a
purposeful execution of a distinct set
of technical parameters when failure
occurs then it occurs
here's the thing beginners don't need to
train to failure because they get
amazing results training really far from
failure and because failure tends to
impose a lot of pain and instability
that challenges technique and makes it
degrade when it's not real solid yet
it's a bad choice for beginners the best
thing you can do a beginner is trade
very far away from failure and focus on
doing two things one getting your
technique fucking rock solid once your
technique is rock solid you add weight
to the bar slowly and check to see if
your technique is solid again for sets
of five to ten reps
and in so far as your technique is still
good you add more weight if your
technique is not good the next session
you don't add more weight because you
didn't earn it
and then you do the same shit again same
sets and reps again but this time your
coach you're your trainer or you tell
yourself i'm gonna have excellent
technique on every fucking repetition
that i do today and when you can
demonstrate excellent technique and
you're still far away from failure you
get more weight on the bar now
eventually
as you realize a few years from that
you'll be able to fail gracefully with
excellent technique but then you're not
a beginner anymore so beginners we need
to really sign on learning that
technique shit keeping them the fuck
away from failure until they can
demonstrate to us or themselves that
even as they get close to fail their
technique is rock fucking solid
advancing relative effort
and saying whatever techniques whatever
is stupid as fuck because technique is
something that is
really not that hard to learn
but bad technique and this is notorious
in sports is incredibly difficult to
unlearn and relearn
if you learned how to squat shitty
and you're now squatting right as you
get close to failure and your
subconscious drives turn on and your
conscious mind is just telling you not
to die
you may revert back to bad technique
because that's what you learned first
is that a solvable problem yes but it
takes like three times longer to solve
bad technique issues than it did to grow
that bad technique so my best advice to
beginners and folks train them focus on
technique
and demonstrating good technique make
the good technique be the thing that
earns more weight on the bar rather than
more weight on the bar is just something
you prescribe and good technique is
assumed that's how intermediates should
train but we already assume they know
good technique with beginners that's not
the case and good technique is something
that serves you for the rest of your
training career and if you don't have
good technique you're just exposing
yourself to
really shitty stimulus to fatigue ratios
and a higher risk of injury
add infant item as long as you continue
to train with shitty technique
lastly
the fifth
satanic sin
my wife and i have been watching some
cult documentaries boy they're always
fun and they always remind you satan is
always close
i wonder if satan is wise to my jiu
jitsu game motherfucker in any case
fifth thing that beginners do that's a
really stupid idea is they try advanced
programming
folks
advanced programming
is designed for the advanced lifter
advanced programming is very intricate
very nuanced very complicated and a
fucking pain in the ass to actually do
and if you're a beginner and you can get
equivalent growth from barely doing
deadly dick to doing all the advanced
shit in the world why in the fuck would
you all the advanced shit
and because advanced people train really
close to failure because they heavily
rely on mind muscle connection and
perceiving where your lats are before
you contract
there's a lot of shit there that
beginners can't even do
here is a pretty decent analogy of what
a beginner using advanced system looks
like
like uh
alright so
i gotta fight some zombies
five zombies
i'm a beginner what's my best tool and
let's say old school zombies so they're
like
they move like a mile an hour like you
can run around them in circles and
they only ah they only catch you on
every pass you don't even turn around
i'm thinking like a spiked baseball bat
or a machete is golden so we don't even
give you a gun because you just shoot
your own dick off
maybe if you've used guns before we give
you a gun with a real simple
instructions right on there on the gun
you just bang and bang and
miss that one and
bang
fine
right
the most powerful weapon you did not use
what if we give you a really powerful an
advanced weapon remember five dumbass
zombies coming up to you in a mile an
hour
and we put you inside of the u.s
local
air defense network
you got your f-35s on their
various support packages f-22s and a wax
is on the screen except you can't read
any of that because you're not qualified
to read a fucking radar screen
or an integrated comm screen you have no
idea what's going on and your
lieutenants and staff are like uh sir we
get the permission to attack and you're
like
uh yeah attack what are we attacking
where the coordinates you're like what
the fuck are coordinates you're not
qualified to operate that system that is
way more powerful than a fucking
baseball bat with spikes on it it would
be nominally easy for any military
aircraft to kill five zombies on the
ground but you're not able to do that
stuff because you have no fucking clue
what's going on
beginners think that advanced is better
it's not better it's just something that
the advanced need to progress
as a beginner you have better genetics
than them your responses are better than
the advanced because they're easier so
use the simple easy shoot you're
competent with get your awesome easy
games because you get them anyway and
then when you need it
you go to the advanced levels of stuff
right
your kids are hungry
you fucking do a
easy mac and cheese recipe and they
think it's the greatest thing in the
world you don't invite emma lagasse to
your fucking house to make them the best
fucking meal they've ever had because to
them it's all the same they're like oh
this meal was good amarillo was almost
as good as cut up hot dogs i had last
night he's like fuck what the hell am i
here for same idea all right so
beginners can do really simple shit and
benefit and that's good because you want
them to do simple shit because it's
simple technique simple understanding
they can take ownership for what's going
on they can realize what's going on
they can track progress real easy and
all the great things come from that
advanced stuff will save for the
advanced
cool folks my last bit of advice to you
you don't need a spike bat for five slow
zombies
you can just fucking
son of a bitch
zombie
see you guys next time
