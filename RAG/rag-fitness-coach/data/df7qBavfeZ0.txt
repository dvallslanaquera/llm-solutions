the real reason is if I do leg curls and
I take like a five minute break after
when I do leg presses and squats later
my hamstrings really don't get involved
much and leg curls are just not very
systemically fatiguing like the
hamstrings are a large muscle but not
like large like the quads leg curls do
not require axial loading at all right
so you can get them out of the way get a
really great stimulus and then move on
to the next previously I had been really
really prioritizing quads and so I did
leg curls last and I got to say I did
like five sets of them towards the end
and didn't get super sore because I was
so tired from doing a crapload of hack
squats and a crapload of lunges and all
that
