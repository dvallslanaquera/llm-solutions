[Music]
hey folks what's up it's me Dr Mike for
a Renaissance periodization and I would
like for you to give uh to come along
with me for a little ride and the ride
isn't that fun it's not a roller coaster
it's just uh myself and Jared training
back
this is like a real world Vlog style
training session where we just train
back like we normally do it's Wednesday
morning
and uh we're in Las Vegas Nevada at
elevation gym we go to a couple gyms
here the other two Being Fit club and of
course well I was gonna swear but
the elephant dragons there Flex effin
Lewis
um all great gyms this one's great too
if you're ever here in Las Vegas Nevada
I would check those three gyms out at
least
we are going to be doing bake three
exercises Jared's back is a little bit
hurt he has a back injury kind of in his
lower back so he's going to be uh trying
to figure out ways around that we'll see
how that works I'm feeling pretty good
but uh we'll find out what's going on we
got Pull-Ups
assistant Pull-Ups for more volume and
slightly high repetitions and then cable
flexion rows we are going to warm up
with assisted Pull-Ups for regular
pull-ups because well we weigh like 200
whatever odd pounds gotta warm up so
we're gonna start doing that right now
and if you really like this kind of
video a little Vlog style training
session we do these all the time in the
members section so this is kind of like
one of those little like oh the members
get it and you get it as well but if you
want more of this kind of stuff give us
some thought to signing up for the
membership it's like five bucks a month
and you get an extra video every week
and every now and again one of these
videos will be this log house we'll
style training we recorded a bunch of
them uh we're gonna record a bunch more
in the future so come along for the ride
warming it up warming it up assistant
pull-ups are excellent warm-up for
regular Pull-Ups
exercise is very similar you can use a
very small fraction of weight
[Music]
oh
one thing that's
pretty cool in warm-ups
is you instantly realize the utility of
the warm-up
because typically the first warm-up set
I'm using 160 pounds
of extra assistance which is a ton
typically the warm-up set
feels like I'm so weak
and my joints are so creaky
but the idea that this would instead be
my first work set is wild
I would underperform like crazy I'd be
like
six reps off of what I could normally do
and I would be a little bit concerned
about getting hurt
doing things cold is stupid
which is why when people try to do like
pull-ups cold
I was like what are you doing why do
push-ups like this too like
you should warm those up too
when I start warming up
Everything feels creaky and weak and
weird
and I'm like oh my gosh fuck am I even
supposed to do this
blood gets flowing joints get greasy
second warm-up set I'm like better
still don't know how I'm going to do
this works that shit
third warm-up set I'm like okay great
first work set I'm like okay damn I felt
pretty good and the second Workshop I'm
typically like we're groovin for sure
and on to the next work sets
how do I know when I'm gonna be training
bottom left that's what knows my
training nowadays the RP training app
and as you can see
it already has
my list program from last time and has
automatically updated my rep goals
and the weights that I'm using after I
do each one I'll check in
Yahoo I just gotta follow what the app
says
[Music]
160 pounds of resistance for 12.
85 pounds of assistance rather
four eight
feeling pretty groovy
probably go to the actual
pull-up station you'll see in a sec it's
not that great
and uh
then I will uh I do about two reps get
the feel for it and the next set after
there's a work set we're shooting for
all Round Here
I think it's wide enough
yeah
oh I hate feeling constrained let me try
works yeah yeah I'm putting on straps
Jared said they helped a lot on this I
have this thing with straps where
recently since I'm getting older I'm 38
bodybuilding career maybe has a couple
years left in it I'm trying to milk all
the gains that I possibly can
and
there's still this egotistical thing of
like why don't he I don't need straps
for this but if they get me one extra
high quality rep with a mind muscle
connection that's really good versus me
having to think about my grip at the
same time I think it's worth it so I'm
trying to do is like I'll just use
straps on anything I need to even
hypothetically get a small benefit from
I'll use the shit
if you think about it for a while and
you're like why am I in here is it to do
some ego bullshit with my grip or is it
to get a big back
the answer kind of clarifies itself
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
ugly last rep
body weight
Target
11 reps I got
check mark
automatically moves down to the next set
eight is my rep Target
for this next set I gotta get eight
Pull-Ups
this
pre-plans my progression for me
to make sure that
I'm hitting small PRS every session
if I can't it auto detects that my
performance is off
and it tells me hey you good
and if I fix it in half a week it says
hey everything's good everyone has a bad
day
see if it finds out that for a week
straight you've been declining on a
muscle group
it recommends a deload or a few recovery
sessions
weird sports science game
literally right it's being spit
amazing
real life I'm gonna try a set with no
straps unfortunately
putting straps under this thing is kind
of tough I like to cinch them in and I
can't get a good angle to cinch so I'll
just use some extra chalk
and see if I can uh
see if I can get that situation going
these are actually pretty good grip
elements so pray for me
oh
[Music]
worked
I don't want to brag you might not be
able to do this because you're not that
level of financial well
I should have walked into a Walmart
a couple days ago legally
purchased this item I got it I just want
you to think of yourself from the Reebok
store they invited them over what's a
Reebok store they have a thing called
the Reebok store
my Ascent concentric pretty explosive
which is nice they generate a lot of
muscle activation that way not mandatory
that's how I like to do them
but the eccentric especially at the
bottom is slow
but a really really milk that stretch
and also
a fast reversal at the bottom
slight increase in injury risk
and for what to do more reps why to grow
more muscle yes but what if you did fuel
reps but did each rep better
you grow probably the same amount of
muscle from that
and with a net reduction and injury risk
you're kind of like winning on all sides
there
the only loss you're taking is you type
in seven instead of six reps or whatever
six instead of seven in your notebook
throwing your RP training app coming
soon
so
a lot of stuff in the gym
is kind of ego driven
by default and you sort of don't process
that
like
all
why am I trying so hard to get 12 reps
on here
at the expense of my technique and you
think about it longer you're like
because 12 reps damn it and then you're
like wait a minute
if the technique is good the progression
should result from just me getting
stronger over time we're gonna zero in
on really really good technique
and make sure that the Reps come as they
come if I can't get another rep of good
technique
it's just not happening
11.
eight seven
six
Pull-Ups
that's the last set six
time for assisted pull-ups same grip
the big benefit of assisted Pull-Ups is
twofold one you get more repetitions per
set which can a lot of times put you
in that rep range that's more conducive
to growth at this point I'd be doing
sets of four and three probably better
to do sets of five to ten
but
I'm gonna actually get into the 10 to 15
range with the assistance
the other benefit
is that
the assistive pull-up
slows the movement down for you
and puts it on Rails
so you can think less about the
mechanics of pulling
and more about how the mind muscle
connection is feeling are you getting
that good Peak and traction are you
really letting that stretch pull the
muscle apart
the Mind muscle connection and assistant
pull-ups it's not just helping you with
weight and you just do the same old
pull-up that you can
it helps you with the weight so you can
focus more on your Technique
on your mind muscle connection
specifically not your gross motor
technique
I think that's a really really big thing
and if you do assist the pull-ups right
it's a light bulb moment where you're
like oh fuck this isn't just pull-ups
with assistance it's a little bit more
than that to really really meticulous
muscle growth training
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
holy moly
oh I can feel that this is a great
Hammer Strength assistant chin and dip
recommended very good machine not the
best of its kind
but damn it's up there
really
critical things to look for an assisted
pull-up machine are one good range of
motion specially bottom stretch
two is
very smooth lubrication
which combines with three
to be something like
you can get a lot of eccentric loading a
lot of loading on the stretch some
machines it's really hard to pull up and
then a way down you're like
that's no good The Eccentric is huge
and robbing yourself of that
not going to result in a ton more growth
this machine pretty well checks all
those boxes so it's good in my book
[Music]
duh
[Music]
so
good enough grips for me here especially
with just
the assistance weight
I don't have to use straps
reverses
not bad just really trying to focus on
following the movement up is just up
whatever
following it down
feeling my last stretch
under load and really pull apart
really helps me make sure I'm
preferentially activating my last system
the thing that slows it down so on the
way up I'm kind of using my entire pull
complex I don't care lats biceps
everything
on the way up I try to preferentially
activate my lats
which really kind of is like a mini
uh eccentric accentuated overload
training
because
if I just use my lats alone try to
however effective that is to get up I
probably get a few fewer reps
this way I get more reps in each one of
them is eccentrically overloading to my
last it's a big deal
I think on the margin may do a little
something extra
[Music]
I'm sure some of you are watching this
video
and you're like
I do a bunch of Pull-Ups
I can't do a bunch of assistive Pull-Ups
the only thing left is cable rows we'll
talk about those in a bit
it's like three exercises sort of maybe
like two
two and a half
it's not exciting training it's not not
in this case
but
the way Jared and I construct our
understanding of training is we want
results
what the best possible long-term results
and if according to our knowledge of
sports science and our experience and
feedback multiple straight sets close to
failure of the same or similar movements
seem to give us the best results that's
what we're doing is it maximally
entertaining for the viewer or for
ourselves
using a bunch of different machines
different angles
fuck man no no shade but I saw someone I
follow on the internet
did a back workout
it was like five by twelve seemingly
like six different movements
holy shit that's just a lot of different
moving around
it was short rest and it wasn't close to
fail
but it was definitely more exciting to
watch as as a viewer if you watch that
back workout you're like wow there's a
different stuff going on this is cool
you can like learn a lot from it
different angles different machines he
uses
he used some of the same machines but
very different pulling styles
it's kind of like a
no take it's like a car commercial when
you see a car it drives in the city it
picks up the kids it drives in the
country goes up and down Mountain Roads
it picks up a goat some shit like that
uh drives by a lake drives on the sun
and you're like wow this car can do a
lot for sure
when you actually buy the car you're
using it to go to work and drop the kids
off at school you're probably not
hitting any fucking mountain ranges on
your way
and that's the difference between
driving a car for utility versus driving
a car to show off
so our workouts are very utilitarian in
the sense that they're purely
utilitarian
the utility from them is
maximum muscle growth accretion over
time you can learn a little bit at least
to like the monotony to embrace it
to see five sets of assistive pull-ups
on your program and be like
I like this and someone's like really
it's the same thing like I like the fact
that I plug in and really dig into the
monotony and the pain and the brutality
and I know I'm gonna get the best
results
and I learned to like the thing that
gives me the best results
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I'll just get into this straight
underhand uh overhand but I love the
this part
it's really like I don't know clicks you
guys like that science just fuck clicks
bro just fuck do my back clicking it's
55 pounds for Jared feather
120 pounds for who is Daddy me
many of you don't know this
it's two things
one Jared feather is my literal
biological son
two and I know this is crazy
certificates Public Access motherfucker
you know you don't have a birth
certificate I do and I don't have a
father on it no no that's the shit your
mama drove with a crayon four sets on
this
my reps are in the 15 to 20 range
whatever the app says what I did last
time plus a ref
so
that's uh
it's gonna be fun
focus on technique
Jared has a back injury this kind of
hurt him a little bit so he might go do
some inverted rows or machine rows or
something
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
doing this exercise
is to push my hips back really far
I try to lean forward a little I get the
ultra deep stretch and then Arch but not
lean back
so shit my spine is perpendicular to the
ground
Gentle Touch the tummy and then pull the
magic Center come up my back to round at
the bottom pulling all the fibers out
deep stretch huge growth Drive
and then back again there's not a lot of
weight it's not very intense it's not
systemically fatiguing God damn this
isn't Zapped the back holy shit
[Music]
ow
I fucking mid-back kills
those are my biggest muscles already
my dick shape directors
but bigger is better
17 repetitions
no JK 16 Miss Reddit
uh
back is pumped
plumped
feeling swole
joint pain is great man
if everything was like vertical pulling
for High Reps be sweet
but yeah
weighed uh 245 pounds this morning
thereabouts
pretty lean
so
it's in a good place have another
few weeks left of kind of very slow
massing
and then after that it's a little active
rest phase about two weeks
contest diet contest prep
I'm gonna be targeting July mid-july
gonna do Masters Nationals and Jared is
uh
what are you competing in next either
Charlotte or Pittsburgh Jared diets down
and once he gets lean he picks the show
which I actually think is smart
[Music]
huh
super awesome to uh
be able to use the
alpha build of the harpy training app
long time in the works
and uh
and it's just kind of sweet to be able
to like see everything you need to do
you can edit whatever you want
reps and load after the first week
I'll pre-programmed for you for the
progression
so you don't even have to think like oh
should I add 10 pounds or whatever it
does it for you
and you just hit the Reps and the weight
that it says it's kind of freeing
because I know because I wrote the
algorithm
I know it's a good decision and then I
can't use like excuses I'm like oh well
I don't know like that's what it says
you should be able to do this if your
progression is good
it's a pretty liberated train like that
we'll let you guys know when that app is
up for sale
it'll be uh
150 000 second to use
but you can save big by getting the year
for three trillion dollars
I'll hit you with those prices again
later but a little less
anyway
that's been the training folks
this is like this is what our training
really looks like
uh no Bells no whistles
minimal grunting
every now and again a pathetic screen
for help you know like the things you do
in the dungeon with your uh mistress or
silver Daddy
yes yes
anyway Jared any wise words before we
let the folks go
did a good job Mike
what was that you did a good job shut up
okay
