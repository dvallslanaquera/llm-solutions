the research on metabolites and High
Reps and pump stuff working just as well
for hypertrophy in any unit of time it
has been measured so far
as strength work or lower rep works
that's a five to ten versus pump and
metabolite stuff the research showing
that that stuff is roughly equivalent is
done exclusively on Maddie's almost
exclusively as three studies ever on
enhanced people with training so if
you're saying man pump metabolized stuff
doesn't work for natties you are not
just making something up you're making
something up that is both wrong and
directly contradicts the very primary
literature you love to cite to support
your points so we'll stop that's just BS
