hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's quick tip is the
compound isolation sandwich an awesome
training technique that i developed in
my secret training laboratory we've got
lasers
photon torpedoes no that's a weapon
from star trek i remember one of the uh
early sort of pieces of feedback on the
photon torpedo
was that
um
you won't be you you can't see a photon
being fired from behind it or above it
or anything else because it's actually
light doesn't like coming back from it
in any case i think the fucking super
nerds that wrote star trek or whatever
explained that technically it's just
it's just a charm for uh that's not
photons it's just a torpedo but it
sounds cool it sounds cool shut up mike
star trek's great easy nerds easy don't
get in the comments and jump down my
throat i like star wars plenty whatever
star trek wars it's all the same again
i'm kidding please do not come after me
or do come after me what are you going
to do about it write in the comments
chewbacca
so
compound isolation sandwich
compounds are great
for muscle building compound movements
multi-joint
isolations are also good
and we know that whatever muscle group
or sorry whatever exercise you do first
tends to be your highest energy exercise
and tends to bring the most stimulus
and if we really want specificity like
let's say we really target the lats or
we want to target the biceps or the
triceps or something like that
you know we want that real targeting
exercise to be first but hold on because
compounds often don't really target just
that muscle they target other ones so we
have this kind of conundrum of like oh
we want to isolate the muscle first but
then again compounds are really good
when they're done fresh
so how do we solve this problem it turns
out we can have the best of both worlds
right
compounds produce generally the highest
forces they expose your musculature to
the highest forces and they're best done
fresh you get more coordination you can
put more external load in all as well
isolations can really focus in on a
muscle so they're also really awesome to
do so we don't just want to say oh only
compounds to grow muscle isolation is
really awesome but if we just do like
three compounds at first and then do
isolation last maybe the isolated
exercise is just you're so tired by then
you don't get a lot out of it so how do
we solve this the really cool thing is
we're going to be able to use the
pre-exhaust sort of
principle or technique in order to get
something really cool together we can do
it all with the compound isolation
compound sandwich here's how it works
you have a target muscle group the first
exercise you choose is a compound move
that heavily prioritizes that muscle
the second exercise you choose is an
isolation for that muscle group and then
the last exercise number three we got
the compound isolation compound the last
exercise is another compound move
for that last muscle group
but
it has at least one degree of freedom
which means that whichever muscle you're
isolating let's say triceps instead of
chest
your chest can't take over when your
triceps are tired because if your
triceps don't produce a certain minimum
amount of force your exercise technique
will collapse and you actually won't be
able to do it what do i mean by that
let's look at the examples to explain
exactly what's going on and how to do
this so first example for chest let's
say we really want to fucking nuke our
chests
first exercise barbell press okay great
chest builder hits some chest hits a
little bit of triceps chest is really
cooked we're well on our way next
exercise is a cable fly okay you don't
do the cable ply before the chest press
because you want compounds first great
check okay and compounds versus a
magical thing that's always true it just
so happens
that much of the time properly executed
targeted compounds just a really really
good way to to drive a lot of stimulus
so you get the compound out of the way
cable fly and then your pecs are pretty
fucking cooked and then your third
exercise can be another compound the
dumbbell press why dumbbell press if we
did machine press we could get a really
good stimulus however it's been shown
that something like a machine press
if your chest is pre-exhausted and
you're using machine presses technically
speaking from a biomechanics perspective
because there's essentially no degrees
of freedom if we mechanically silenced
your sorry uh neurologically silenced
your chest like we like well geez that's
a bit rough but we cut the motor nerves
to your pecs or you know give you some
kind of weird like nano drug that just
turned off the motor nerves for the next
five minutes you could actually do a
chest press with zero zero chest
whatsoever just elbow extension okay
chest press machine is fixed you're
fixed into the seat if you just extend
it looks exactly like you're pressing
because there's nowhere else to go no
degrees of freedom your shit's not going
to go out this way because the chest
press machine prevents that from
happening
if your chest is really tired and this
is the big drawback from improperly
executed pre-exhaust if your chest is
pre-exhausted from flies and pressing
then when you go to a machine chest
press if your chest is really tired your
body's like
we're not going to really turn it on
that much like hey triceps pick up the
load and your triceps get a huge hit so
if your chest is really tired you might
have noticed on machine chest presses
where there are no degrees of freedom
you're making a ball or tricep pump at
the end of three sets and you're like
okay i'll take the tricep pump but i
really wanted my chest to get activated
but it seemed like a chest was mostly
off because it's so fucking tired how do
you solve that problem
you have to do an exercise which is
compound for sure but it has to have a
degree of freedom so you have to
activate the chest for example a
dumbbell press if
the chest doesn't bring
your humerus this way and you just
activate the triceps this is what's
going to happen when you do a dumbbell
press let's say your chest is
neurologically silenced you're going to
go like this
and the dumbbells are going to fall out
so in order for you to go like this and
this
you have to have chest activation which
is to say that if you do barbell presses
and then cable flies and your chest is
really pretty exhausted when you do
dumbbell presses your chest is the
limiting factor and you're going to get
fucked up beyond all recognition
unbelievable chest stimulus check check
check check we're out
right and then you can walk out of the
gym with a huge chest pump that girl at
the fucking the gym counter you're like
hey hey and she's like oh my god your
pecs are so big take me on a date nose
through santos
spins around then you know you're in the
fucking money because satanic bitches
always put out
i think right or you'll die either way
you get a date haha your boys got the
hook up dating advice too
quads how do we do this properly with
quads start with a compound
hack squat excellent compound
then you do a leg extension okay we got
the isolation now if we were to do
something like a leg press last still
good but if your quads are really cooked
and you're leg pressing you can actually
again because you're fixed into the back
of the seat
your legs are fixed into the plate you
can technically do the entire leg press
movement with only your glutes because
if the femur is extended this way
your knees have to go there's nowhere
else to go zero degrees of freedom
however if you do a barbell squat
if
you're at the bottom of my rough squat
right here's your torso here's your
femur if you simply activated your
glutes and not quads you would do this
loop and the bar would fall off your
back and you would fall backwards and
probably kill yourself so in order for
you to do this and actually rise up you
have to use your quads and because
they're pre-fatigued they're limiting
factor try this shit i'm not lying hack
squat then leg extension then barbell
squat make sure you take half of your
normal working weight for barbell squats
you're gonna walk out like a fucking you
know newborn deer you're gonna dunk the
squat and come back up you're like oh my
fucking god this is all quads it's a
thousand percent quads that's right with
renaissance periodization multiply your
quad growth by 10. fuck actually um
unrelated
i uh i saw a legit
ad pop up on youtube when i was like
watching some fucking i forgot what
video i was watching
this the shit cuz you know a lot of
targeted ads and they figure i'm into
fitness
the first it was like one of those like
30 second um video ads
and the first shit this motherfucker
says
was
i can't say this without laughing
drinking a glass of water before bed can
um can lead you to lose 46 pounds of fat
in just a few weeks and i was like
what
what the fuck have i been doing this
stupid-ass phd i got telling people to
cut their calories and increase their
activity
one glass of water before bed
predictably there's one thing it makes
you wake up in the middle of the night
to pee
fuck goddamn lies out there in any case
try the shit it works fucking sweet last
example and something for you to use in
your own training
you say you want to fucking really
target the lats weighted pull-ups great
awesome compound lat builder hits the
biceps and rear dots 2 blah blah then
you do a cable lap prayer right one of
these straight arm extensions really
good technique fry your lats and then
again if you were fixed in place with
some kind of rolling machine you might
actually be able to do most of the row
with your biceps like if you just
contract your biceps and it's fixed here
fixed here yeah again you could be
pulling but your lats are like fuck that
we're taking the day off
a dumbbell row to the hips
because if you just activate your biceps
and not your lats the dumbbell row
begins to be a curl you're bent over and
you do this and hit yourself in the face
probably not very hard because you're
tired with dumbbells you look stupid the
girl at the gym counter is like
all right
wow and then you're for sure not getting
any
satanic hookups
dumbbell row to the hips
because your lats are pretty exhausted
and they must be the limiting factor
when they're pretty exhausted because
there is a degree of freedom and they
have to contract
you're getting fried fucking lats
you walk out of the gym
big ass lats
and the girl at the front desk is like
um do you have like imaginary lat
syndrome and you're like no they're real
look at me i've got handled that
and you do like a back pose and you
already know the joke she says the
satanic things you go over to her house
her head turns around somebody's getting
laid see you guys next time
dude if you knew a girl was like a
satanist would you still hit it
