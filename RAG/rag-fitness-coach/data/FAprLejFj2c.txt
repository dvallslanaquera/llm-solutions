oh God they just have it hurt oh
Jesus
let's try sitting up
[Music]
hello folks myself I am Dr Mike and
today we have two special guests and an
old old person I'll introduce in a sec
our first special guest is joycey and
she is an extraordinaire butt kicker
Supreme she's like I bet I can run
through a workout that you and Dr might
cook up for legs no problem I won't even
sweat and he's like well she's like shut
up get me on your channel he ran to me
tail tucked between his legs I calmed
him down we got her on the channel and
she's like but hold up I don't ever go
anywhere alone and we're like okay do
you have like an agent or a manager
she's like I have a defense contractor
with me this is Brandon he has a PHD in
mechanical engineering and his job is
literally to work for the evil military
industrial complex which keeps you safe
you hypocrite mother
I'll peep that myself we are going to do
legs which might mean two or three
exercises let's see how far these young
kids get into this any last parting
thoughts before you
atomize away into the atmosphere did you
bring your birthday oh no but there's a
bag over there so uh you've got right in
the Mike's bag
into your gym bag Oh you mean my bag
absolutely that's disgusting let's get
into the workout
[Music]
all right folks we are going to be doing
a 45 degree back raise interesting call
interesting name for an exercise we are
going to be doing it to Target the
hamstrings there's a couple different
variations you can do we recommend
taking your machine and putting it on
stilts and the reason for that is we
want it to be pretty vertical so that
more of the tension gets imparted during
the stretch if you have a totally
horizontal uh back raise then the peak
contraction is the hardest part as you
go down gravity pulls you less and less
if you're all the way down at the bottom
you actually get nothing we want more of
the tension on the lengthened part of
the contraction which is why we lift
this up this makes the force curve
better for this exercise just to make
sure the shit make sure the shit doesn't
slip out halfway through and you kill
yourself here's how we're going to be
doing this exercise
you want to lower this platform so that
it clears the hips so you can get actual
hip rotation you don't want to platform
so high that it ends up being
articulation of the spine because that's
not the hamstring function that's your
spinal erector so you're going to take
your feet you're going to push them all
the way back to get a very firm perch at
the top
and then
you are going to lock your knees out or
almost completely out you're going to
keep your lower back arched you're going
to descend slowly under control until a
painful stretch in your hamstrings try
to keep your tummy out and your back
arch and you're going to come up for the
P contraction and slowly descending in
all the way down and then come up
a way to challenge yourself with this
exercise
is the first few reps if you're holding
weight it's all same but if you're doing
this with just body weight first few
reps you reach your hands out to create
a longer lever arm and more tension on
the hands when you get tired bring your
arms in shorter lever arm and then it's
easier it's almost like a mechanical
superset type situation give that a shot
and uh
let's get started
good I want a more convincing lockout
squeeze at the top all the way up yes a
couple more two more
[Music]
and one more
and up throw the dumbbell down
continue
[Music]
try looking up
look up
full lockout one last rep go lock it one
more one more you will shit you're
strong let's go lock it out good enough
good stop
not bad the getting out is always
embarrassing because you're like I don't
have hamstrings to get out with
all right folks so what you're seeing is
we have him do a dumbbell we tried doing
a barbell but the supports are hitting
that's unfortunate they're holding a
dumbbell here right at the chest
when they're done with being able to go
close to failure with the dumbbell we
switch to dumping the dumbbell and just
doing free because if the dumbbell
weight is gone you've bought yourself
some more effective reps it's it
literally uh I think it's called a
mechanical drop set or something like
that in this case it's just a
conventional drop set but it's a really
cool thing you can expose yourself to
doing the 45 degree back raise the
tradition of people think oh I'd do a
set of 10 and I'm done in this case if
you if it's just as easy as dropping the
dumbbell and you get three or four more
amazingly effective reps why not do it
also the stimulus to fatigue ratio on
those drops is going to be really high
because the mind muscle connection is
already so set in typically once you're
doing something heavy if you switch
quickly to doing something lighter the
Mind muscle connection explodes because
your body kind of feels overqualified to
do the coordination you can really focus
on torching the muscles give this a shot
don't do too many sets at the beginning
but you'll burn your hamstring right off
the body and the the corner will have to
write that in this report and that
patient present a corpse presented with
no hamstrings burn marks included
do more workouts shut up my full
convincing lockout oh yeah let's go
let's go let's go we're here to work
today but forward
[Music]
good stop
and the embarrassing crawl out begins oh
gosh
who buddy awesome awesome good job good
job awesome stuff man awesome stuff if
you keep your feet a little more
straight and you just get that because
your feet kept going like this and
you're turning yeah this was getting
hard you're trying to leverage yourself
to basically make it easier so keeping
your feet here and trying to force your
knees open it's going to hit your
hamstrings even more you'll get less
reps but it'll be more effective for the
hamstrings okay
all the way up so you can position hips
open yes
feet in position hips open
yes
[Music]
one more try oh there you go transition
boom walk off
stretches just that way there you go
[Music]
hips open knees there you go perfect
yes yes come on look up look up saved it
here you go
I really felt it hell yes that was a
modification
made it more difficult yeah definitely
more difficult but keeping the feet at
least the toes getting it from your
knees instead is yeah it keeps it on the
same because like I said it's just like
okay these I'm getting really tired of
my hamstrings so I'm gonna start
pointing my toes out and leverage myself
to use maybe a little more glued or
whatever so just really really lock in
place and get it from here you're gonna
feel the hamstrings are gonna get way
more fatigue way more quickly and then
let's drop the dumbbell with five reps
if we have to no big deal okay that
makes sense because at least for me I
could feel like as my feet were going
out I was using more and more glute
right in order to like keep it exactly
exactly
all the way up
yes one more good one
finish that rep
and then as if another slow
dump
begin
good
oh shit yeah man this is all day stuff
let's go all the way up and back nice
[Music]
one more and you're done
that's it oh yeah good stuff good job
way to lower
I don't know if I'm gonna get out
[Laughter]
ah
Jesus Christ
one more one more good one come on knees
all the way up yes and um
good there you go let's get two more at
least come on
board
stop
up come on up there you go all right
good stop
[Music]
oh this is getting really embarrassing
yeah
kind of just kind of melt out and just
melt away oh my back is so tight
excellent feel free to lay down
already so soon
oh my back
[Music]
this might be bad tomorrow this is so
much harder in person
[Music]
hamstrings are done lower back's pretty
fried glutes fried as well
second exercise will be the quad
exercise of the day and that will of
course be the legendary lover squat
slash pendulum squat same thing
we are going to be doing sets of oh I
hope kind of 10 to 15 reps here we will
absolutely be doing some irreps this is
a great exercise for my reps this is
resting at the top of the pendulum is
actually pretty easy you get a whole
back pad you just kind of lean back lock
out your legs safely and you can just
chill for a few seconds and then do a
few more reps a few more UPS a few more
reps here's the big kick off of this
exercise
the beginning of the movement at the
very top once you unlock your knees
the force is insane and then it drops
off towards the bottom not the ideal
strength her butt great variation to try
outside of leg presses and hack spots
you have to be ready for that force in
position at the top otherwise it will
collapse you you can tell someone's
doing a pendulum squat wrong when they
just fall into the shit and then rock it
back up and fall into it must control
The Eccentric the whole time which is
going to be a lot harder to do at the
top than it will be at the bottom it's
going to feel like your quads of tearing
which is exactly what we want let's get
to work don't go anywhere don't you
fucking reach for that handle there is
no handle
chest up control
last one begin all day
[Music]
chest up

walk up and there's gonna be a little
platform you're gonna stop halfway on
