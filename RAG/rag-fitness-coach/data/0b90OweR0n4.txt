hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization and here's our
video for today how steroids can harm
you
not so great news up ahead
but before i get into the details i'm
gonna do a little bit of real talking
i'm not here to propagandize you you've
had enough of that shit from mcgruff the
crime dog or whatever the fuck in your
middle school anti-drug class
and many other ill-fated government
attempts to try to get you to abstain
from drugs altogether and we've seen
from the research that that probably
works in reverse if it maybe luckily
doesn't work at all
steroids and related anabolics are like
all other drugs in the sense that they
have upsides yes
have downsides
have intelligent use cases in the right
scenarios
and have insane dumbass use cases in the
wrong scenarios that will get you into
deep shit
so we're gonna do here since we're
pretty familiar with steroid upsides if
you're really interested i can make
another video about that but we have a
whole bunch of videos just uh search um
my last name and steroids
um in any case
we have plenty of youtube videos on the
benefits and what you can expect from
steroids and shit like that um but here
we're just going to take a look at their
downsides this is not an exhaustive list
i think i probably missed a few things
here and there but a pretty good one and
we see if we can't get y'all
mf mfers i think it's too early in the
video to swear youtube algorithm is like
that to get just a bit more informed so
that you make marginally better
decisions
and
you don't fuck yourself up as much as
you could doing dumb shit um
as long as you avoid doing two things
one is breaking the law so this entire
video is dedicated to the residents of
the united kingdom where steroid use is
legal for personal consumption and
nobody else
maybe other countries of the world that
don't have laws
and uh
this one is a for sure for sure for sure
thing
don't ever use them
at least with my approval to cheat at
regulated sports so if there are sports
that do drug testing
don't ever fucking cheat at that shit
um i'm like a pretty decent jiu jitsu
grappler uh brown belt
i'm a masters competitor according to
ibjf
and uh you will never see me in an ivjf
competition because it's drug tested
and
well you can fill in the dots
so yeah sure is just dumb so fuck that
uh don't do anything stupid and don't
break the law
but if you are in a position where you
can use anabolics legally and not in a
way that is cheating
you should probably know about some of
the downsides so here we go
this is a long list
but i've separated it into general
categories first
not necessarily in order of how bad they
are but pretty close
chronic high blood pressure pretty
decent side effect reliably of many
kinds of steroids escalates with dose
what does it lead to is chronic high
blood pressure by itself is whatever
it leads to all kinds of really fucked
up shit and the longer you have it the
more likely least these things first
kidney failure you don't want that you
don't want dialysis anyone who ever
talks about having dialysis or just the
machine is your kidney is like a
miserable miserable terrible terrible
process you never want anyone's in your
life and usually when you start dialysis
you never get off
stroke
fun you
lose all your memories or some shit you
can't speak anymore can't use half your
body uh no thanks
heart failure
bad news
maladaptive cardiomyopathy basically
your heart thickens in such a way as
makes it worse at pumping blood
in
not so bad cases leads to reduced
exercise performance and trouble walking
upstairs in extreme cases leads to again
heart failure so really bad and about
like 1 000 other
thousand geez that's uh
one million that's what i wrote uh just
a gajillion other downstream problems
chronic high blood pressure will zap
your ass and the worst part is you can't
tell you have it unless you measure it
regularly a lot of times moderately high
blood pressure that's chronic which will
fuck you up
is undetectable from a perceptive
perspective so like you sit around and i
feel fine and you check your blood
pressure like holy fuck it's really high
looks like it's been high for years and
then in a few years you're like oh shit
kidney results aren't great and you
begin to die so
we'll talk about uh later how to
remediate some of these problems because
that you can but you got to be aware
chronic high blood pressure is a fucking
killer
next poor lipid profile which means what
uh excess ldl cholesterol or the kinds
of ldl cholesterol you could have other
kinds that are very very bad for you uh
because there's a few kinds some not so
bad for you some pretty bad for you
toodle too little hdl the good
cholesterol very common problem with
anabolics
and uh
some of these uh lipid profile issues
lead to atherosclerosis which is the
filling of your blood vessels with
plaque by itself if you know almost
nothing about biology sounds pretty bad
and it is and about a million other
downstream problems and including other
cardiovascular related problems like
blood clotting which can lead to stroke
and embolism both of which can kill you
especially embolism
and uh it's nothing you want so poor
lipid profile not something that's
sustainable not a good idea
here's a category of problems not often
discussed so there is a body of
literature about them it is a growing
body of literature still evolving so
some of this is a little bit tentative
brain problems okay
there is a legitimate concern and
possibility that steroid use especially
at a high level for a very long time
makes you permanently less intelligent
in some types of intelligence it seems
to affect visual spatial intelligence
more than verbal intelligence
again the resource literature on this is
not um
not substantive enough for us to make
definitive conclusions but it's
speculative uh scary enough to be like
holy fuck
so could serious could make you dumber
in the long term
that leads to usually nothing good in
life
there are almost undeniably temporary
decreases in some types of intelligence
um and that's damn near for certain on
higher doses of drugs uh clearly i'm
drug free but an alternate universe in
which i'm not when i'm on higher doses
which my higher doses are
most people's mijackness
cruising doses i'm not trying to pat my
own backs truth
um
i definitely feel a reduction in
fluid intelligence
and it fucking blows because i fucking
make don't make money with my muscles
and make it with my brain and
you know it's a thing and when i come
down from the higher doses i'm like oh
my god i know everything
so it's
not great really not great um it's
something i've made peace with but uh i
don't like it i don't like it at all and
you shouldn't like it either so um
again i'm not here to propagandize you
but if you look at magazines and fucking
magazines jesus christmas 1998 instagram
and shit like that tic toc all your
favorite bodybuilders like oh my god
that guy's living the life like yeah but
this is shit that happens behind the
scenes so if you're like oh i should get
on like yeah all right see you dumber
right
the thing is maybe some of these brain
things don't really happen this way but
maybe they do and some of them can
impact you later in life so the steroid
abuse and i do mean abuse not just
intelligent use that you subject
yourself early in life can lead to a
higher risk of alzheimer's and
potentially dementia later in life you
know anyone for alzheimer's or dementia
um
as a matter of fact late stage
alzheimer's presents as dementia uh it's
nothing fun you forget who the fuck your
relatives are you forget who the fuck
you are you forget how to speak uh you
forget what the fuck you did yesterday
what doing yesterday means your brain
slowly shrivels into fucking nothing uh
and those people don't look like you're
having too much fun so nothing you want
now
that's all the sort of brain damage
intelligence production capacity
reduction type stuff in the short term
steroids do absolutely affect your mood
and uh your various sort of emotive
functions including here's just a sample
this isn't everything
uh uncontrolled inner rage at nothing
and everything you take enough gear
everything pisses you off and nothing
pisses you off
like you could just be sitting watching
a movie you're like fuck and people like
what's wrong you're like
nothing nothing's wrong i'm just pissed
that sucks it's not fun to be pissed
another one you get is really gnarly is
what i've termed toxic righteousness
like you just feel really righteous and
really like
chip on your shoulder butt hurt about
shit for no reason like i'll be fucking
scrolling on instagram
and
like legit real talk this is the kind of
shit that goes through my head um
like i'll fucking
read the fucking
so i'm gonna be like
i post a picture of like oh i got a new
bar for the gym and someone would be
like oh i guess we'll have to delay the
lamborghini fund a while and the first
thought that pops in my head which by
the way i'm not defending it's fucking
insane thought it's like shut the fuck
up like stupid fucking lamborghini joke
like that's my joke i make that joke
you're not fucking my friend i don't
even know you
what why am i having this what the fuck
is wrong with me i'm a fucking nobody
i'm just like you as a fucking human
being and i'm like
fuck all these stupid people like
it's awful it is awful to experience and
in the moment you can often feel
righteous about it like you're like yeah
fuck them and then later when you come
to your senses you're like
i don't i don't like this i don't like
this at all um and of course uh the
crown on the king's head is massive
anxiety
uh
like you won't believe
um if any of you have ever done have had
bad experiences with like marijuana when
you're coming up on pot uh you're just
like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck uh
mushrooms same idea just to come up uh
really gnarly anxiety just imagine that
uh but like for the entire duration of a
16 week cycle like you wake up anxious
you go to sleep anxious you wake up in
the middle of it you're anxious uh
common experiences i'm taking a shower
and i'm just like
fuck fuck fuck i'm having a panic attack
now it's not like visually if you were
to see me taking a shower that will cost
you that's not only fans but
if you were just watching me do that
you'd be like it looks fine but in my
head i'm like oh my god oh my god oh my
god and there's nothing there's no
reason for it like i start looking
through my life like did i do all my
work today yeah okay
i'm healthy
financially stable um
okay i guess everything's fine but it
doesn't feel fine anxiety fucking blows
it's terrible and a lot of people don't
talk about it
why the fuck would you talk about it
it's awful
but in any case
a lot of times when you see pros like
pull out of a pro show and be like i'm
just dealing with some problems
personally a lot of times it's that i
just couldn't handle the anxiety
last one is cancer with a question mark
it's not very clear that steroids can
cause cancer um but
potentially they can but they definitely
increase in most cases the growth of any
tumors that you have and so a lot of
times you'll have a benign tumor or
benign growth that like for a decade or
for the entire rest of your life just
doesn't go any further but if you
introduce anabolics into the mix
sometimes that benign tumor can turn
malignant or just a benign growth can
turn into a tumor and then bad things
happen so
uh definitely if you have a cancer risk
it's probably higher if you use steroids
real talk that's how it works now that's
the really bad shit and i'm sure there's
other bad shit i missed but at least you
understand the kind of shit we're
dealing with here
their next category here are some gray
areas these are definitely downsides
still but they're um not quite as bad as
the earlier ones for a few reasons three
specifically usually they're transient
and easily reversible like they're bad
when they happen but then they go away
um and maybe not even not even that bad
when they happen
sometimes they're entirely or partially
preventable with intelligent use or the
use of ancillary drugs and a lot of
times they're cosmetic in nature so they
think they're really calm they just like
suck right like you know
if you go to the doctor and he's like
you're in heart disease you're gonna die
tomorrow like that's real bad that's
harm if you go to the doctor and the
doctor's like you're ugly you're like
all right tell me something i don't know
sorry see you later like that's not
exactly harm it just fucking blows so
what are the shit that we're talking
about first is cosmetic shit hair loss
now in my defense every fucking member
of my distant family has no fucking
goddamn hair actually one of my
grandfathers had a full head of hair
fuck that guy he was the man uh
yeah i didn't get the best genetics but
holy shit the fucking shit does not make
the shit better right
um it just happens and it doesn't happen
to everyone but it happens to enough
people who wear like if you're
predisposed to hair loss there's a good
chance adding anabolics into the mix is
gonna make things worse again there are
drugs you can take to counteract that i
don't fucking take because i can give a
flying fuck if all my hair falls off my
body it'll be great because i fucking i
hate shaving it i hate cutting it i hate
the idea that i have hair if i just be
bald forever it'd be awesome but it's a
pain it's a pain uh
for many of you that care about what
your hair looks like um again uh not for
everyone there's a distribution about
this some people don't get this at all
some people get it really bad acne
potentially really gnarly acne
like pimples that are like this fucking
big and like purple on the outside and
then red on the inside and then have
like the fucking
the jizz white dot thing that's like
bigger than anything you've ever seen in
your life it's really fuck it's a
totally different level of pimple you
potentially get
um you could have a weird skin tone aka
the tren tan like you know you see guys
on gear and you're like how is that man
red why is he red it's just red right
some of that's from uh high blood
pressure uncontrolled but even to
control blood pressure there's a bit of
a skin tone thing it doesn't look great
uh in all cases and i'll get to the
situation with females where it looks
even worse but we'll get to that in a
sec and of course um hair growing in
place god places god never intended to
grow if you use anabolics and you're
prone to body hair growth
wouldn't know anyone like that hair will
grow to an unbelievably extreme amount
all the fucking time and in places where
you're like why is there hair here it's
fucking annoying it's awful again not
harm but some shit you might not want so
again i'm not trying to propagate just
give you the real fucking deal maybe
you'll get on youtube and maybe
someone's more real than me
but if you're into the shed and you're
like i'm gonna fucking gear up and be
like my heroes are all jacked
there's some other shit they're going
through that either takes a lot of work
to remediate or it still happens and you
just fucking deal with it
not exactly all fun
more gray areas surprisingly i count
liver damage as a gray area why because
it's hard to really do a lot of liver
damage unless you're really doing dumb
shit
uh if you go on like
government-sponsored websites of steroid
harms you'll find a lot of the stuff
i've been talking about and you'll also
find liver damages like it's up there
this is very easy to research very well
documented the thing is it's almost
always insanely exaggerated
in
most people so they've done studies
where they've given oxandro and anavar
at relatively high dosages up to like 50
milligrams a day to like japanese women
for like a year and a half and they had
no liver value elevations what they
deliver perfectly fine in order to
really cook your liver real bad with
oral steroids so first of all
liver damage almost exclusively occurs
with oral steroids with a few exceptions
and also you have to take usually a
really gnarly orals and for like a
fucking really long time and the thing
is if you do some liver damage with
orals your values get all fucked up if
you stop using orals and drop the rest
of your gear for a few weeks or a few
months your liver really is unbelievably
regenerative and just generally goes
back to being fine so
it is
in my estimate not this completely
terrible thing can you get liver cancer
abusing steroids probably
you got to really try you got to really
try so i would say this is a really
unusual case
um
next endogenous test production shutdown
you guys probably know about this you're
all the boys aren't making any tests
anymore because they detect that there's
a lot of testosterone or testosterone
like substances in the blood and your
access the hpt access is like bob
clearly the testicles are producing way
too much testosterone let's shrink them
shits down to damn near nothing that
happens it doesn't happen everyone some
people when they get on gear after a few
weeks or months their testicular size
radically reduces to
something between undetectable to like
the size of like a caper uh one of my i
had a doctor as a client once and that's
what she kept telling me because back
then i was natty and she was like don't
do it i was like i'm gonna do it she's
like capers paper she always was talking
about that um
so that can be a thing you know it's all
fun and games until like you're saying
bring a whole girl home from the club
and you're like so baby zip and she's
like
there's your dick
where else is the shit i'm not like
bitches are interested in balls per se
but you got some explaining to do and
your ejaculate volume can be profoundly
small to essentially non-existent like
you're still busting nuts
ain't nothing coming out nothing's
happening
not exactly the worst thing in the world
but also
you can
reduce your fertility to such an extent
that you aren't able to have children
approximately and maybe that you aren't
able to ultimately have children people
have
made themselves permanently infertile
steroids again very rare but definitely
a risk like so if you like are 33 years
old your health is in check you know
what you're doing you live in the united
kingdom where it's legal and you have
like three kids anyway already and
you're totally good you fucking don't
need any more kids hey you know rock on
whatever fuck it but if you're like 23
or whatever and you're like i really
want a family someday but first i'm
going to be a pro bodybuilder like
you've got some fucking decisions to
make um
again
a lot of people just there's a huge
spectrum of responses some people
their testicles remain exactly the same
size their ejaculate volume remains very
robust which is actually quite annoying
uh and i'm not like i'm speaking from
experience saying i don't actually ever
have sex so it's not an issue and uh but
it ranges all the way from like you get
all the bad stuff to you get all no
effect and everything in between so it's
just something to keep on your radar
again nah it's not fucking deadly or
anything like that but definitely
something to keep in mind lastly and
this is specifically for teens that use
steroids and me saying that pains me
because if you're teenager and using
steroids you're just like doing the
dumbest lamest fucking shit you could be
it's like motherfucker what are you
doing you grow muscle like a fucking
weed anyway when you're a teen i'll put
it to you this way
if you're not growing a lot of muscle as
a teen you're probably not eating enough
you're not training enough
or too much and if you do have those
boxes checked and you're still not
growing muscle you're just gonna look
like harry potter the rest of your life
accept it be a computer program you're
gonna make tons of money you're gonna be
bearing you can marry a stripper or
whatever is the goal when you're a nerd
and you don't worry about muscle taking
steroids as a team is rock fucking
stupid it's the dumbest shit you could
ever do and here's the kicker if you
take specifically certain kinds of
steroids as a teenager it some of them
close your growth plates in your bones
early so you'll never reach your maximum
adult height like you were supposed to
you could be like i'm going to take
steroids i can finally beat up my dad
and then it turns out dad's six foot
three and you kept out of five foot
seven and you're age 40 and dad's still
beating that ass
good job you fucked up your life
so um if you're a teenager and you're
watching this
don't fucking take steroids
just don't fucking do it when you get to
be an adult you live in the united
kingdom
maybe you can think about it after age
25 but if you take it before you're
making some interesting trade offs if
you take gear before you're 20
miss me with that bullshit i don't know
what i'm saying don't do don't do stupid
shit like that
all right almost done here but hold on
what about females
they get all the side effects we talked
about pretty much other than testicle
ones clearly although they do become
infertile while on steroids
approximately
um the sides are almost always way worse
and even if they're the same magnitude
of sides or even lower magnitude sides
generally androgens
masculinize everything and females tend
to like to remain to some extent
feminine now of course there's a huge
spectrum and again politically i'll just
put my cards on the table i'm a
libertarian so i think anyone could look
like or be whatever the fuck gender they
want
awesome i'll shake your hand no matter
who you are
but a lot of women like to stay
relatively on the female side and they
get into steroids and like holy fucking
shit i'm turning into a man well no
fucking shit what do you think was gonna
happen right
for health appearance fertility you name
it females take huge huge side effects
i'll say this if you're female you
follow this channel you're considering
using steroids
do not fucking dabble don't go on
fucking reddit and be like oh i want to
google a cycle oh and of ours first time
female cycle great don't do that shit
talk to someone like broadway chavez
talk to someone like joe jeffrey yes
they cost money your health and
appearance i promise you are valued more
and have someone who can explain to you
the very nuanced intricate way in which
females
who choose to use these substances
should do so to minimize all the side
effects i promise you you don't want
receding hairline being one of them
and
maximize the benefits
males taking steroids is relatively
straightforward of course it's nuanced
and we have a bunch of other videos
about how nuanced it is but for females
it's a fucking minefield so
don't just roll the fucking dice but
here we go got these drugs boom because
you'll get all the good gains and i'll
be sweet you get some other shit you're
really absolutely not interested in
all right
how do we mitigate these effects because
i'm not gonna do that stupid fucking
propaganda shit where i just tell you oh
these are all these bad things and
that's it see you later like okay how do
you mitigate them
first
you run safer drugs drugs engineered to
be safer by laboratory scientists that
are living through chemistry drugs like
oxandralone aka anavar primobolin
testosterone fine drug to run in
moderation and another drug like
masteron right but really like var and
primo are like
the kings of the safer use model safer
not safe safer
and try to minimize or stay the fuck
away from drugs like tran and halo and
anadrol and i know i know we've all seen
the trend memes like when when she
feeled that trending like like word up
the thing is that people mostly making
the trend memes and laughing at them or
people not on trend because when you're
on trend you don't laugh at memes
anymore you look at memes and you're
like everyone who makes me such fucking
stupid i hate memes i hate my fucking
phone you break your phone stab yourself
in the face trend instantly heals the
wound you're basically wolverine but
full of hate
in any case shit's not fun and it fucks
you up try to stay away from the gnarly
drugs now a lot of times the gnarly
drugs are the ones that give you the
best games
in the short term in the long term the
safer drugs do an unbelievable job
giving awesome gains with a lower risk
profile so if you're short-sighted just
do a lot of trend and halo and a draw
you're the fucking man if you're taking
a long view do the safer use shit and
don't fuck yourself up
to that end point number two is moderate
your doses essentially you choose a low
dose that gets you some of the results
you want and that's your peak dose that
you use and then as soon as it's not
getting you the results at pace that you
want
then
you consider thoughtfully of mildly
incrementing the dose you start really
really low which which means what like
somewhere between 200 milligrams and 500
milligrams total of your first actual
cycle not just orals or whatever and
then you work your way up if needed as
needed by the way that's for men only
women it's like a 50th of that
as needed per your goals do not fucking
start underground don't start at three
or four don't do what the pros do
because you're not a pro yet first of
all
second of all a lot of pros are just
profoundly stupid people not all of them
plenty of were awesome a lot of them are
dumb as fucking rocks and i'll do stupid
shit all the time and you just don't
want to copy people like that
the worst thing is that you copied
someone how they do and you meet them in
real life and you ask them questions
they don't even know what they're doing
you're like oh jesus christ who am i god
being here right
um
point number three take off or low
periods regularly get off of drugs
entirely for months of the year or go to
trt levels for months of the year really
good idea if you're just blasting all
the time
i think we all know where that road ends
the answer is rich piana
sorry to put a fine point on that but in
any case some shit like that
lastly get blood work and ancillaries so
first of all control your blood pressure
with medication if necessary there's no
shame in taking medication for blood
pressure i literally know guys who are
on fucking gear and they're like man
fuck that i'm not taking drugs from my
blood pressure i'm fucking gonna do it
with exercise and diet and bro
and like herbs motherfucker herbs you
put fucking bathtub trend into your body
idiot what's one extra fucking blood
pressure drug gonna do except keep your
dumb ass alive matter of fact while i'm
on the subject don't take the bloodshed
dogs it's great if you fucking eject
your ass out of the gene pool in any
case like
pharmaceutical control of blood pressure
is a very advanced sciences essentially
blood pressure drugs are like their
fifth generation now they just don't
really have any side effects and they're
unbelievably cheap it's super easy to
get you go to a doctor and say i have
high blood pressure and he's like how's
your diet you're like it's great and i
exercise a lot but i think you know you
just make up some bullshit literally i i
shouldn't be saying this but like yeah i
have a family history of blood pressure
and they're like okay great and they
just prescribe you blood pressure meds
and they fucking work and they'll keep
you alive so do that shit it's a really
good idea
next one uh do not take uh telemazartan
and uh ppars are a good class but that's
more specific stuff something you
learned from someone like brodar chavez
or joe jeffries um
do not take anti-estrogens either at all
preferably or just just in a few weeks
before a show cause the thing is
cosmetically there's nothing interesting
to do that that takes like eight weeks
or 16 weeks
it takes like a week and a half or two
weeks
and if you manage everything else
properly you usually don't need
anti-estrogens at all because estrogen
is part of a really good look
does estrogen promote the storage of
excess body water yes but by taking
something like telomerene and
potentially a few other drugs like
aldactone etc you can completely get rid
of that part without poisoning yourself
the anti-estrogens multiple research
studies show that probably the most
dangerous thing about steroid use is
concomitant long-term anti-estrogen use
lowering your estrogen first and also
introducing the ancestral drugs
separately as another causative factor
uh
really promotes bad health in a variety
of ways especially cardiovascular it's
not some shit you want to fuck with uh
so don't do it lastly or sorry almost
lastly
if your hematocrit gets too high too
many red blood cells that can lead to
stroke and a bunch of other bad shit
regular blood donation is a good idea
right so we can do that
um
metformin or drug like metformin to
reduce systemic inflammation and boost
insulin sensitivity it's really good
metformin almost certainly does not cost
you muscle gains although studies on the
ones that say they do are probably uh
poorly conducted and it's not actual so
metformin does increase ampk activity
which is a catabolic regulator but it
probably doesn't do so in muscle tissue
so you're probably not costing yourself
any gains
experientially from people who use
metformin in the bodybuilding setting
there's not this understanding that
metformin gets you less jacked like no
one's really ever experienced that so i
wouldn't worry about it too much you
could be wrong about that but it's
unlikely so take it it's very good for
your health in the context and a lot of
other stuff covered by broader chavez
and specifically because he's really big
on this kind of ancillary stuff joe
jeffrey that's right he's from the
united kingdom and he has two first
names and he has tattoos on his face
he's the fucking man give him a look uh
joe physique collective you guys know
