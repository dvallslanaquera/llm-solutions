Mr Greg Knuckles did an excellent
analysis and essentially did the
following he compared lifters in drug
tested federations and compared them
against lifters and untested federations
and saw what the strength difference was
with all the world record lifts and
National Record lifts Etc and sort of uh
tried to figure out okay what's the
percent difference here and he found
that it was roughly 10 percent now it's
a bit different for each weight class a
bit different for males and females
there's some Nuance there but an average
of about 10 percent
