hey dr mike israetel here for
renaissance periodization
fat loss dieting made simple video
number seven
dealing with difficulties in the last
video
we figured out how to generate a calorie
deficit of our choice
and how long to diet for and that can
take us everywhere we want to go
but where we want to go where the plan
is
might not always be realistic or
possible because of various impediments
three of these impediments are very
likely to happen to you in a fat loss
diet
so we're going to talk about all three
of them macro fitting hunger
and water weight problems because you
know this up front before your fat loss
diet
you're going to be that much more likely
to catch it when it happens
fix it even sometimes ahead of time and
not run into these problems these things
have derailed my own diets for years
before i learned about them
and derail diets right now it's delaying
someone's diet
right now it's kicking someone off the
diet right now it's interfering with
diets you don't want to be one of those
people
you want to be successful so let's
figure out how to do that in the best
way possible
first is macro fitting dieting for fat
loss is
tough and if you're doing it exclusively
on the go
trying to make sure your meals have all
the right macros like we learned in one
of the earlier videos
it's really tough really tough on a fly
especially dealing with cravings
your kids are yelling at you you're at a
starbucks you want to make the right
choice there's cookies your kids are
eating them
boom cookies down the hatch and the
whole diet is down the drain right
you can use apps to make things easier
the rp diet app
it lets you plan all your foods and type
them all in myfitnesspal does that not
meal by meal but just for the whole day
so you can have an advantage using apps
but even with apps you gotta log in all
the foods and all the stuff it's a great
tool
but there are ways to take that great
tool and make it even better here
is the big tip choose for most of your
meals
two to four basic proteins basic veggies
grains and or fruits and healthy fats
like chicken or fish
some broccoli some cauliflower some you
know spinach
some brown rice pasta oranges not mixed
together
unless you're into that sort of thing
and some you know avocado
and some uh you know maybe coconut
butter or something if you like
that sort of flavor on some of the meals
olive oil maybe some nut butter
a handful of nuts so on and so forth so
now you just have a couple of choices
and you mix and match flavor the meals
and prepare them
in bulk drop them into the fridge or the
freezer
that means all the macro calculations
you just don't have to do on the fly
anymore
you're not at that restaurant thinking
oh crap what do i order off this menu
you're at your office at work and you
open up tupperware and you're like
diet success is easy as one two three if
you are of means
and it's actually not that expensive a
little bit more expensive than regular
consumption of food
get with a company like trifecta and
they literally make all your meals for
you and ship them to you or they send
you already pre-cooked meals
in bulk pre-cooked foods pre-cooked
chicken steak shrimp so on and so forth
veggies
brown rice white rice etc and if you do
that
then gee you hardly have to think at all
i eat almost all the daily food i eat is
trifecta it's the easiest thing in the
world if you can't do that you can for
sure buy your own food and cook it
the big thing is batch cooking bulk
cooking separating into meals ahead of
time is a
huge advantage if and when you can't
make it
to your regular meals you can't travel
with them have really good pre-planned
ideas of what you're going to have
on the go for example turkey jerky or
beef jerky that's lean
great idea for protein fruit you can buy
almost anywhere fresh fruit
these are all gas station foods by the
way handful of nuts one of those like
you know little nut packets they have
protein bars protein shakes these are
great replacements
if you're on the go you're at business
meetings or something you're traveling
across the country to make some big sale
and you stop at a gas station you don't
have any food every single one of these
things or almost every single one is
going to be available and you can
construct
macro friendly healthy meals everywhere
you go because a lot of people say oh
man i didn't have anything to eat so he
ate like five cheeseburgers like
you didn't have to do that and now
because you have good on the go ideas
and maybe you keep some of them
on your person you know in your backpack
uh in your car or something like that
because beef jerky i'm not even sure
beef jerky ever goes bad don't quote me
on that
uh you know you can leave some of that
stuff around nuts and beef jerky travel
everywhere
protein bars travel everywhere so a lot
of the stuff you can be prepared you
don't just have to do it on the fly
at the end of the day fortune favors the
prepared
if you've bash cooked all your meals if
you section them off into the fridge if
you bring your meals to work
if you have your emergency go-to options
for when you can't make the meals
you are almost destined for success if
you want to on the fly everything
good luck good luck it might not work
out so keep that in mind
next hunger okay as you lose more and
more fat
you will become hungry and hungrier this
is almost a guarantee okay
it's just evolution doing its thing
trying to be like hey you're starving to
death eat more now you're not actually
starving to death
but evolution doesn't know that because
evolution you know our evolutionary
history does not involve purposeful
dieting ever
until the last maybe 100 years maybe
less okay
tons of people fall off the bandwagon
because of this because
hunger is an incredibly powerful primal
human sensation that will
will at some level hunger topples every
will power
but even at a small level hunger hunger
topples a lot of willpowers and all of a
sudden people are cheating on their diet
so on and so forth but you can be ready
for this
there's ways to get the same macros and
nutrients with much less hunger way
number one is to eat more filling foods
as over the weeks you tend to get hungry
and hungry and diet for example
fresh fruits fresh veggies if i put a
plate of broccoli in front of you that's
100 calories it's going to take you like
an hour to eat that shit you're going to
be so fully
holy crap can i please stop well if i
put
100 calories with potato chips in front
of you you're going to go like this
done what's next i'm hungrier now right
so you have choices you have choices
yogurts are very good especially greek
yogurts
and very lean protein sources all of
those things if you include more
of them than fewer of them in your diet
these are anti-hunger foods
right or rather they squash hunger
better and keep you fuller for longer
another interesting tip you might not be
aware of is if you eat very tasty foods
on a deficit it sometimes makes your
body just want more of them
like what is that advertisement they
used to use back when i was a back when
i was a young man in the 1990s good god
i sound old i am old
uh you know you can't eat just one
potato chip that shit is true to some
extent
because chips are so good you eat one
and you're like
fuck that was amazing i want more you
know and
after you eat the whole bag you're like
i don't want any more chips yeah that
was 1500 calories
so that occurs in normal
populations uh that aren't trying to
lose fat when you're trying to lose fat
and you've been doing it for six nine or
12 weeks
your hunger sensation is so sensitized
that one little bit of tasty food makes
you want to eat a sea of tasty foods
you can modulate this by purposefully
making your own prep food
not bad tasting just not that great so
you eat it kind of more like a machine
and
ta-da like you're sort of done with it
and people are like oh my god do you
want more
you know relatively bland salted chicken
and brown rice and broccoli with no
flavoring you're like
no like do you want a cheeseburger
you're like yes why do you have one or
like no
all right my next meal is what you said
so i'm just going to eat it you're not
going to overeat your food
it's not going to have this rebound
hunger effect and everything will be
much better
yeah you can eat a ton of really tasty
foods
but who have you ever seen eat
unflavored
eggs or egg whites and unflavored cooked
oatmeal
and just gorge on it like oh my god man
i ate 3 000 calories of unflavored eggs
and okay
nobody's ever said that right highly
unlikely so if you make your food a
little less tasty over the course of the
diet
you have your high chances of success
you don't need to do that unless the
hunger is getting to you if you're like
dude
every time i eat my meals they're so
tasty after i'm done with them i'm like
oh my god i wish i had more of my own
prepped food
then you know it's time to cool it on
the flavorings of the prep food and make
it just
blander if anything else lastly
there are going to be times for most
people when they're predictably hungrier
or less hungry
some people wake up starving in the
morning but towards the evening they're
like man
some people are the other way around
where they wake up in the morning
they're like i can't get them to eat
even if they're in a fat loss plan
they're like man i feel fine i could eat
but whatever
and then in the evening they're eating
their own limbs if you know which person
you are whatever times of the day maybe
after workout pre-workout whatever you
get hungrier
choose most of your macros or sorry more
of your macros bigger meals to go in
that really hungry time
and then when the times just predictably
aren't very hungry you can eat a lot
less food and save the food for when you
are hungry so for example
for me when i'm in a fat loss diet i can
wake up and literally not eat for two or
three hours i do all my training and
then i have my post-workout meal
it doesn't affect me at all maybe i'll
have like a small shake or something
like that or a little bar
i don't need a big meal when i wake up
because in the morning i'm generally
just not hungry
in the evening your boy likes to eat so
i'll save more my food for the evening
and all of a sudden
i'm just never hungry throughout the day
i eat less food in the morning when i'm
not hungry anyway
and then when it comes evening time i
have so much food left over that i have
tons of food to eat and i'm just not
hungry
and then day after day after day after
day after day of a deficit while i'm
losing weight i'm not very hungry
win win win win win awesome awesome idea
give it some thought
lastly waterway problems this is a big
deal
sometimes you're losing a ton of tissue
using tons of fat maybe a little muscle
hopefully not mostly fat
but the scale weight isn't going down
day after day sometimes even week after
week
or it's barely going down and you're
suffering and you're tired you're hungry
like how the hell did i only lose 0.3
pounds this last two weeks this is
bullshit it is bullshit but i actually
lost a whole lot more tissue in all
likelihood what happened is
you're storing more and more body water
as time goes on
a lot of times this body water is stored
just under your skin mostly in
the places your fat used to be stored
the same problem areas in which you
store fat so for me it's like my love
handles
if i have a lot a big water bloat going
on my love handles look
they feel a bit different i have like an
educated feel for that thing
um they look like i never lost any fat
to begin with
you mean can you imagine you're
suffering through a caloric deficit your
body weight's like meh
and you look at yourself in the mirror
like i look like shit i look like i'm
not losing anything this can be so
devastating psychologically
it's easy to just quit your diet and
tons of people go through this
however a lot of the stuff happens for
some distinct reasons and has some
distinct solutions
first a lot of this is caused by stress
if you stress
less do whatever it takes in your life
to stress less and sleep more a lot of
this
gets much better so some people will
stress stress stress and they'll weigh
the same and they'll get more bloated
and everything sucks
and then they finally like whatever and
they cheat okay the cheating has nothing
to do with this
they stop stressing because like fuck it
the diet's over and then they go to
sleep for nine hours and they wake up
shredded and five pounds down or like
what the cheat meal did it no it didn't
you just de-stressed
you could de-stress without a cheat meal
and if you do that voila you'll wake up
way lighter and everything will look
much better
definitely a thing second when we're
hungry and we can't increase the amount
of food we're eating calorically we tend
to increase flavor experiences and one
of the main ones is salt
if you salt your food more and more and
more week week to week to week as you're
losing fat
what ends up happening is you're taking
in more salt
and that makes you thirstier and because
you're more thirsty
you start to take in more water you're
taking in more salt more water and for a
lot of people that leads to an expansion
of how much water they're holding
plain and simple because you're eating
like three times more salt than normal
drinking two times more water than
normal yeah you're gonna be more bloated
at least for a short time
and especially if you eat more and more
salt all the time and drink more and
more water to catch up with it all the
time
there's a situation where you can go for
weeks with an increasing or similar
bloat and your body's adaptive systems
can't catch up
bad deals so what you want to do is just
standardize your salt and take roughly
like okay
two shakes that's it or you just
actually use a measuring uh
instrument and put in a certain amount
of salt or flavoring and also
standardize
roughly your water intake a little bit
more in your thirsty a little less but
sort of know like okay i drink a gallon
a day
i fill up my gallon this is exactly why
bros have their gallon jug by the way
and i make sure i just slowly over the
course of the day drink the whole gown
right that standardizes everything
it means your body water fluctuations
and your weight on the scale won't look
like this it won't look like that
it'll look like this and like this like
this and like that perfect
and then last problem also in the
waterway category is
that we tend to drink if you're drinking
artificial sweetened drinks there's
absolutely nothing wrong with that you
lose just as much fat
but remember that thing where humans are
driven to more flavor experiences when
they're dieting
in a deficit and uh you know you started
drinking
you know a few diet sprites which is a
fine drink by the way a connoisseur of
diet drinks i am a few diet sprites in
the evening
when you know just it's fun it's sugary
but it doesn't add any calories it's
great
when you're starving you will drink more
diet sprites because your body's like
that tastes like food it tastes like
sugar do more of it and all of a sudden
you're up to six or seven diet sprites
and then you're flushing so much salt
out of your body that you get salt
hungry
because a lot of fluids will flush salt
then you eat more salt
drink more water and some of that water
is or
fluid rather is artificially flavored
drinks they're sugary
they bump up your fluids more crave more
salt and it's this positive
reinforcement mechanism that starts to
happen
and all of a sudden you're bloated so
what i would say is especially when it
starts to get to be a problem
and you know you're getting bloated
limit the amount of artificial drinks
or artificially flavored drinks per day
or drink per day that doesn't mean limit
to as low as possible that means just
like whatever you were doing and you're
good with just do that
five diet cokes a day i don't go over i
don't go under five
okay and then you know how much salt
you're taking in roughly how much fluid
roughly how much artificial sugar
and you're good to go and you're good to
go and it's going to save you a ton of
headaches
keep you of course you'll lose fat the
entire time through this anyway
but this is going to keep you on that
path because when you lose fat and your
body looks better and better and better
is it the craziest motivation you can
ever get if you every week just look
gnarly or gnarly and leaner and leaner
you can be like i don't give a fuck if i
get hit by a train i'm still gonna be
losing fat
nothing can stop me but if every week
you're getting more and more bloated or
not a whole lot is happening
it's so easy to give up on yourself so
with these tips you can
really help yourself succeed in your fat
loss phase and that's good
and a lot of people do succeed in fat
loss not the majority but a large
minority here's the problem
of all the people that succeed losing
fat the vast majority regain
their lost fat afterwards so in the next
video we're going to talk about how to
once you do
lose your fat how do you set yourself up
after to make sure you keep that fat off
we'll talk about that next time see you
next week
