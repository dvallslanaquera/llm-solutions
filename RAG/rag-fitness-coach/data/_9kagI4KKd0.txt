back training
it's back there but it can be tough to
connect with your back
because you can't see it and how
important really
is the mind muscle connection it's not
that important
the absolute way to get a bigger back
is to do the compound basics and the
simple machines that work to stimulate
the muscles of the back
to produce tons of tension to produce a
burn
to get you close to failure and to do
that over
and over and over and get stronger for
reps
that mind muscle connection will sharpen
and sharpen and it will let you improve
your technique
so that you get more and more out of
every single set
but if you're just starting out or even
have been training for years
make sure your technique externally
looks good
your range of motion is good you're not
cutting any corners
you're not cheating with momentum at all
get stronger over time
and your back will grow and then once
your mind muscle connection starts to
mature
it'll grow that much more
