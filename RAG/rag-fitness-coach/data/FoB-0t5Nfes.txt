the late '90s early 2000s there are some
data that showed that the Ecentric phase
is particularly hypertrophic it turns
out that yes the Ecentric is a very
critical part of the hypertrophic
process but it might not be so critical
and so unique and so superlative by
itself that we really can justify
milking it at the expense of higher
fatigue so maybe cheating on the
concentric to milk essential CPS works
but the stimulus to fatigue ratio maybe
isn't that good The Raw stimulus
magnitude of just getting the gains
whatever the fatigue cost is probably
pretty good but in the context of a well
structured program you can't just always
think about raw stimulus magnitude you
have to wonder at what cost of fatigue
something is actually happening
