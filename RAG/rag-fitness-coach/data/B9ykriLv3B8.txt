folks welcome back to the weekly webinar
dr james dr mike
here to answer your ridiculous youtube
questions dr mike how's it going
good i'm good how are you i'm okay my
dogs have pink eye and we're dealing
with that
so as any dog owners know they love poop
especially deer poop it's like little
raisinets for them so i think they just
got their little faces in there and
little too oh
deer poop sounds good i've been eating a
lot of trifecta elk
and it's really good but then parts of
it are like
it's elk so it's chewy and i'm like that
was an ex that's not
an excellent segue great advertisement
speaking of poop
animals that make it some of them are
like deer and i'm off
all right without too much ado let's get
into
question number one let's see how our
youtube aligns
all the way for me at the top would
be alec gorman
got it alec gorman has a very
interesting question today
he says hey guys got a question that's
confusing for a while now typically
people who are fast twitch dominant
are faster and more explosive than those
who are slow twitch dominant they also
typically more muscular
as fast switch fibers grow much easier
uh
why then are elite high jumpers who are
very fast and can have 50 inch
verticals so damn skinny one of the best
high jumpers in the world from qatar
being six five and only 145 appreciate
the time you end up answering this
my quick take before i let james kill it
off is
so these are multifactorial traits being
a great high jumper takes multiple
things
one thing it takes is incredibly fast
stretch muscle fibers another thing
actually takes is incredibly tight
very long tendons sorry um it depends on
it
so very tight uh potentially long and
the the tendons can be short but usually
like the
uh what you see is pretty short muscle
bellies and very long tendons like for
example in the calf
uh very good high jumpers have
essentially almost all tendon and very
fast twitch but they're very very tight
like some of these people have trouble
squatting to depth
even with weight because they're that
tight which is good because they spring
out of them
in addition to that being a really good
high jumper requires that you be
skinny so it's very possible to be fast
twitch and skinny
fast which muscle fibers are not the
fiber itself is big
but that doesn't mean first of all you
have a lot of fibers you could have a
small number of fibers unless you're not
just very big
but if you train with weights as a
faster fiber individual
and you have a lot of fibers and a high
my nuclear domain
reserve sorry high satellite cell
reserve that means you can potentially
get much bigger
then you get much bigger and we do see
that in bodybuilding some folks
actually flex wheeler as an example his
original nickname was skinny kenny
wheeler
okay because he's just fucking skinny
and he had to eat
he has to stuff himself his entire
career he had to take loads of drugs
that would be called volumizing drugs
like they just put
pounds on you quality or not because he
was just fucking skinny and he had to
fix that problem
and it was always a struggle so the
reality is
that it is absolutely possible to be
both fast twitch and skinny
most faster twitch people are not skinny
but those precious few who are both
skinny and fast which
first of all have a little bit of harder
time at bodybuilding than non
skinny fast rich people if they
transition uh but second of all
are really really good high jumpers and
uh
that is a very small percent of the
population which is why elite is elite
james yeah yeah great start and just to
build off mike's uh
idea of being skinny here so the thing
with any of the jumping sports high jump
long jump generally
uh particularly the high jump it favors
people who are tall since it's not
scaled to your body height right if
you're five foot tall you're simply not
jumping as high uh
at an absolute scale as someone who's
six five right it just it benefits you
to be very tall
it does benefit you to be skinny in the
sense that you actually want
as few things that could possibly touch
the bar or interfere with your jump as
humanly possible so if you have big
broad shoulders like there's more likely
that you're going to have incidental
contact with
the bar and then the power to weight
ratio is really kind of the root of the
skinny issue where
it's good to be tall right it's good to
be skinny but
ultimately what you want to be able to
do is propel your body you know against
gravity in the most efficient way
possible and so to do that you have
incredibly fast twitch uh bass and you
just don't have that much body mass and
ballast to carry around so when you
actually
explode and you do a jump like your body
will just take off because you don't
have all this extra body mass so power
to body weight ratio is really important
there
another factor to just consider and this
is just something because we've been
doing the hypertrophy book so just it
was off
up my head i just because we were
looking at it um you have to keep in
mind too that
uh muscle growth factors are also kind
of independent
in some ways of type 2 muscle fibers
they do tend to grow more but some
people just don't have good growth
proclivity and that's just how it is
another thing to keep in mind is that
kind of getting back to that power to
body weight ratio thing
most of those high jumpers they're not
training hypertrophy stuff they training
for like maximal strength pretty much
exclusively for
whether that's intuitive or they they
thought it through and said i can't
afford to get too
beefy just that's what just what they do
in the field they just do strength
training james
sorry can i put in one real quick thing
yeah i think it's a very
easy thing they experiment with we all
know that higher volume training causes
temporary reduction in the neural
ability to be explosive especially
so i think a lot of these guys it's not
some calculated thing for some of them
it is
but a lot of these guys they'll do one
exercise for a set of ten
later that afternoon they'll jump
that's it exactly so there's a variety
of things that's mostly
kind of part of their programming
whether they've thought it through
all the way or not that's just common
practice and that's just how it is they
don't do a lot of volume
next up is sebastian huber
oh god ours are definitely out of order
today you can like control f and it'll
probably find it
oh yeah good old control f sebastian
got it boom oh wow we got it hi docs
is there a way one can tell besides
biopsies
if certain muscles are slow or fast
twitch maybe some kind of a test i can
do in the gym so i actually have a
pretty good answer here for you we'll
see what james thinks about
um first of all we just a quick reminder
there's no such thing as slower fast
twitch it's a spectrum and all of your
muscle sits somewhere in that spectrum
and all of your muscles have all kinds
of different fibers so it's slower or
faster twitch proclivity
right uh it's like um is your
furniture in your house brand new or
completely old well you have a bunch of
different furniture in your house some
of it's newer some of it's older and
most of it's somewhere in between
but like some houses have newer
furniture and some houses of older
furniture on average even though it's a
spread
right same kind of id so when you have
that
question of like is my furniture newer
or is it older
right are my muscles faster or slower
twitch stimul uh
uh uh fiber type um
uh actually the better question to ask
is how should i train them to get them
as jacked as possible because look
real talk motherfuckers you feel me
that's all we give a shit about like
fast slow whatever we're trying to get
jacked
you actually kill two birds with one
stone with a test that tests sort of
both it tests the fast and slow not so
well
decently better than nothing but it
tests the growth proclivity real well
here's the deal
uh the only one that's super fiber
specific is when you fail
in a muscle does it fail instantaneously
girl
oh and it can't or can you grind the
more you can grind with good technique
if you can grind for like six reps
straight you're probably slower twitch
than average in the muscle ever since
fast which fibers in there there's just
not that many of them
so if you can't grind hardly at all it
feels like one rep feels great and the
next rep is like oh no i can't then
you're probably faster twitch but
there's tons of other contributing
factors neural factors mechanical
factors
so that's just a little like little
spice in the equation like okay probably
faster twitch on average over a large
population but it's no guarantee
here's the real way to test a little bit
for fiber type and a lot for hypertrophy
at what rep ranges do you get the best
pumps the best disruption
and at which do you get the best
perception of a deep tension in the
muscle
okay if you are faster twitch if you do
sets
of five to ten reps it's going to feel
like the muscle is
deeply tensed tearing itself to shreds
you're gonna get huge pumps in the set
of five to ten range your best pumps
possibly
and you are going to get sore and fucked
up from a few sets of five to ten where
you can barely walk
if you are slower twitch that same thing
is going to happen with higher rep sets
like 20 to 30.
and then sort of 50 50 intermediate
fiber distribution which most people
have
is in the 10 to 20 rep range okay so
really what you wanted to know was what
stimulates me the most and you find the
answer to that question so basically if
someone's like hey
i'm doing hamstring curls sets of like
25 because i thought high reps were
supposed to be good
i just feel tired i don't get a pump at
all i'm just like blood's running
through and running right out it's like
i'm
jogging i don't feel like tension
anywhere i get i get to burn towards the
end but it just hurts
and i'm just exhausted and i don't even
feel what's going on and i've done like
six sets of them in one workout i don't
get sore i don't even get weak i can
just walk out of the gym and run a mile
okay that ain't you probably more of
your hamstrings are faster twitch in
that case but also even if it's not on
some kind of weird thing
then it doesn't matter because that's
all the stimulus proxies we have
pomp disruption perception of tension
and target muscle they all failed
now if you take those same hamstrings
and do sets of eight in the stiff-legged
deadlift and after two sets of eight
you're like
and you're like i feel like my hamsters
are physically fucking tearing during
this exercise
i feel a deep tension in the fucking
middle of my leg and
i get a huge fucking pump and honestly i
can't even walk out of the gym i gotta
limp towards the toilet and re-evaluate
my life as i sit in somebody else's shit
piss water
that's right you didn't make it to the
toilet guys made it into the stall
and you collapsed into the piss water
branch warren had a story about his
first high volume leg workout where he
physically like
gator crawled out of the bathroom
because he went to the bathroom
to take a break and he fell that he
couldn't stand up it was like
i did that in high school when i was
lifting once because i took like we had
a class that was just weight training so
i did like a really hard leg workout
and didn't think much of it i was like
oh whatever and i remember had to walk
up the stairs to get to
the class and i remember stepping on the
stair and like collapsing and being like
what do i do now i can't hold on what do
i do
i used to be able to walk i can't tell
people that's true anymore
um so so basically that's what you would
do and look a lot of times
you'll get the best of all of those in
the 10 to 20 rep range which means
you're just like most of us which is
intermediate some
some of both and sometimes just on sheer
variation for a little while you get a
lot out of 5 to 10 range
for a little while you get a lot of the
20 30 range but if you find muscles that
respond
more uh beneficially on those indices to
one
or the other of the three ranges just
bias most of your training there so if
you get the best workouts
in the 5 to 10 range make 70 of your
volume there and then the
15 in a higher one and 15 in a lower one
or something like that or in a
still higher so so that's really it and
then that way you answer the question
to some extent if i'm a faster church or
slower twitch but you answer an even
better question of where i get the best
workouts
excellent great answer nothing good good
to go on that
yeah good super all right so okay next
up is
thomas lee
[Music]
honestly thomas lee has a mommy lee
that's right uh don't load any fake
bullets into any guns
you know about oh you know about that
whole thing
no fuck not what was his name bruce
lee's son it wasn't tommy lee i fucked
that oh i was like dude brandon lee
he uh i think brandon uh he like died on
set i heard from like a misfire of a guy
there's some crazy shit i just don't
know i'm spreading rumors at this point
i have no idea what i'm saying
all right uh this is like 90s shit i
thought i knew but
questioning whether i know uh thomas lee
says i'm having trouble finding my
volume landmarks for hypertrophy i can't
find my mrv because my performance never
drops
other than the occasional bad workout
but i'm not confident i have found my
med because my performance isn't getting
much better either
for example my 10 or 11 bench press has
only gone up by five pounds in the last
four years of training that's that's bad
news
do you have any suggestions other than
continuing to increase sets
until i see a noticeable drop in
performance is it possible that i have
astronomical meds like greater than 30
cents per week for some body parts it is
actually possible
that's absolutely possible we chatted
with another guy who like has to bench
press every other day in order to get
his chest to grow
and that's totally possible so i would
say is try to start low
you know like eight sets a week or
something like that
and just try to put more weight on the
bar and not really change your sets a
whole lot
do a couple months of that and see if
you get stronger and bigger and if your
performance is improving
that's fucking sweet then you know it's
above your mv if your performance
doesn't approve at all
maybe you're not above your mvp by the
way during this time eat in a surplus
you gotta get the fuel going to gain
some muscle otherwise i don't even know
what we're testing
if it's the case that you're pretty
standard stagnant at you know
eight sets a week total uh of zero
volume for
whatever muscle group we're talking
about here start to slowly add volume
over time
and here's the real kicker try to pr
every single session you come in and you
hit that muscle
whatever you did last week at either two
and a half pounds or something
or repetition the inability to continue
to add that
will inevitably as you push up cause an
involution
there's just no way that your
performance will be able to be
maintained if you're grinding
zero rir for weeks on end
at progressively higher volumes so what
we want you to do
increase a set or two every week and
then increase by a rep
or buy two and a half pounds or
something also every week every single
fucking time
your performance will decline it has to
there's no way you're going to be able
to survive that when it does
you'll have a decent guess at your mrv
and
during a lot of that time you might
actually make some gains so you'll be
like holy fuck i also gained so
not only do i know my mrv is over here
but there's this productive window that
i've discovered
a lot of people don't
get a sensation that their performance
is ever declining because they're never
pushing it hard enough
for example if you squat 135 for 10
and you come back later later you squat
for 10 you come back later you squatted
for 10
you say my performance isn't changing
yeah sure i agree maybe but you're not
really testing your performance
what you need to do is squat 135 for 10
what one week and then you need to squat
140 again for 10 in the next week and
then 145 for 10 in the next week and
then and then and then
at some point you will stop being able
to hit tens
and you will do one of these and you'll
do a workout maybe six or seven messages
are micro cycles in six or seven weeks
where that workout will be so fucking
unbelievably hard and you'll
barely match your performance that
you'll know and confirm next week when
you try that there's no way you're
touching that realm
next week like when you really reach it
you reach into the handbag of tricks
and try your hardest and you barely eke
out a pr
the next week you're probably not eking
out a pr or even an equivalent
performance you're just not going to be
able to do
as many reps or as much weight so on and
so forth since you're in charge of the
weight
and you have a distinct rep goal a
performance fall off is really really
easy to measure at that point
then you'll know your mrv that's it but
you gotta push the pace
yeah that was a really good like
systematic answer so like i'm gonna give
my
my people's eyebrow on this one so at
the bottom question you know uh
is having astronomical mevs like greater
than 30 sets per week
um is it possible yes is it likely no
so what we generally find with these
situations is it kind of boils down to
maybe like five
very common factors i can think of three
or four off the top of my head the first
one is
using ineffective or non-individualized
techniques for a lot of the movements
that you're using so what we find is
that a lot of people just don't really
know how
they know how to lift like okay but they
haven't really figured out how to lift
for themselves very well this is
something that mike and i talk about
constantly
so you might be just kind of going
through the motions on the bench press
not really thinking about is it actually
the most efficacious way of doing the
bench press that's really stimulating
your chest and other movements
uh along those same lines so the first
thing i would do is i would really
take a long deep hard look at the
techniques that you're using on all
these movements and saying like am i
really
fucking myself up the best that i can or
am i just kind of going through the
motions usually it's the latter
number two i think is people not
and mike was kind of alluding to this
already not using rir effectively where
they're just chronically way under
the appropriate rei like maybe they're
training at like four or five rir all
the time i
actually just had a client that was in
this situation and it was kind of
frustrating for both parties because it
was never made clear that that
understanding was
was not had and after looking at some of
the numbers on their their peak week
summaries i was like this looks kind of
weird do you understand about rer
yeah and they were like no and i was
like uh so we had to kind of start over
on some things which you know for both
parties was a little frustrating but we
got you know we got it through
just people a lot of people don't
understand what like a two
or one rir effort is and that's okay
that's part of learning
um i had another one what was i thinking
oh
using um you know like mike kind of
talked about an earlier question
effective rep ranges for yourself uh
this is a really fun one that you can
play around
here's an example i suck at dips
dips and pull-ups are just not great
movements for me traditionally why
because i'm heavy and i have really
really long arms i have like fucking
noodle
skinny guy arms right so dips have
always been shitty for me because i
could only do like sets of like eight to
ten
on a good day which is not great usually
couldn't even do it unloaded for the
last mezzo and a half i've actually been
experimenting with my dips a little bit
and doing them like
15 plus reps using just like a little
band assist because i have a dip bar for
my squat rack
and out of nowhere like the most surreal
unbelievable pumps soreness disruption i
had ever had
for dips and i'd never gotten that
before why because i'd always do like 10
reps this time i was doing like 18 reps
and all of a sudden
life changing on that movement right you
might be in a similar spot where
you're just using an ineffective rep
range for whatever it is that you're
doing or maybe not the most effective
perhaps you're just doing like sets of
six to eight you're just like i've got
nothing maybe try sets of 10 to 15 or
maybe 15 to 20. see if that works for
you
those are usually really good um kind of
three things and then sometimes i think
number four
is chronically underdoing the frequency
you might be more on the slow twitch
side of the spectrum and maybe you're
only training chest one to two times per
week that's a really good point
maybe you should be training chest four
times per week that's okay you just
might be that guy um
and then if he's slower twitch and he's
smaller and he's doing one time a week
training
he can't reach an mrv because
he did all of his fatigue disappears
between
weeks because it's a whole week of rest
so then training with a higher frequency
would first of all probably get you more
gains and second of all
really let you hit the shit yeah there's
probably at least a couple more factors
but just off the top of my head those
are usually the big ones like
individualizing your techniques knowing
the rir
using effective rep ranges and using
effective frequencies
people have quality of the training
better
making each unit of training harder and
more specific is what james saying
and then assessing the quantity like how
much beer
do i want to drink depends on if it's a
good beer or not
make it good first then pick how much
you want to drink you're not going to
drink piss for fucking 18 cups of that
shit
yeah old speckled hen fuck you so guys
just a quick thing
when james and i uh go on uh seminars
around the world which before covet was
often and after covert will be often
james has this like uh masochistic
tendency
of selecting weird foods that's mostly
his wife
dr davis he does this thing where he
will
ask the locals that were interacting
with seminar-wise or even in taxi cabs
hey look what kind of alcohol do you
drink it's a two-part question
they always think it's just part one
they're like oh well here in western
australia
the best thing to drink is blah and
james is like ah okay so let me ask this
another way
what's a weird shitty alcohol everyone
here thinks is hilarious
and doesn't drink and they're like oh
yeah you want spackled hen
and he goes to the store i go to the
store with him and he's like i'll take
that and the bar and the guy at the
store is
always like okay and then he drinks it
and he's like this
is awful and then he continues to drink
it we just laughed for an entire evening
of him
and i'll smell it or something because i
hate alcohol sometimes i'll have a james
will talk me into a sip
and i'm like you the fuck made this and
you're like i know it's pretty sweet
some notable ones okay so there was old
speckled hand in in england um
in western australia i don't remember
what it was but it was that ostrich
beer and i remember they were like get
the ostrich and i go to the counter
and the the cashew guy's like oh yeah
man you're having a fret potty or
something i was like not having a frat
party i'm just kidding
i was like oh i'm an idiot okay whatever
nobody's ever bought just to get a beer
nobody ever yeah exactly
they just give you that look like are
you an idiot um and then what was it in
finland they had those
salted black licorice liqueur that that
stuff was so
fucking awful i couldn't do that that
one was james what you did in western
australia ordering that beer by yourself
is like coming to a restaurant in
america and they're like would you like
a beer like we have beers on tap you get
you guys have
red dog and it'd be like i'm sorry what
no nobody has red dog walmart has red
dog
right he's so nasty so nasty
all right let us move on
to thanos himself this is an easy one to
search
[Music]
is rpe and rir actually different
generally speaking these terms are used
interchangeably but i've noticed over
the years rpe has been used more to
gauge how easy or difficult to set is
it might not match the reps in the tank
for a lot of people especially power
lifters for example a proficient power
lifter might hit a very smooth and fast
single it felt like an rp7
based on speed and execution but most
definitely won't be able to do that wait
for three more reps so it wasn't three r
some individuals
specifically very proficient ones are
able to move weight so well that they
might have comparable speed and
execution throughout the entire set
before suddenly being at failure
meaning their last might feel and even
visually look like an rp seven to eight
when it really could have been an r1 or
zero
is there something to consider worry
about definitely worry about
thanos you want to worry about it you
want to like ashkenazi jew
like i don't know oh yeah alright
batman level brooding exactly like
um when programming for others or is the
perception of a challenge
per set of rp still comparable to actual
rir
might use using either rrrp specifically
for some athletes make noticeable
differences in performance and training
depending on which one you use yes
might one be better than the other
depending on your goal yes uh
are our p most optimal for power lifters
our ammo shopify also yes
or is this two minute schedule of a
difference most time do you bother
worrying about it's not too miscue
of a difference to be concerned about uh
not worried about
uh so so it's actually really simple so
when you're doing sets of exactly 10 rpe
and rar match up
almost perfectly for every other rep
range
they don't for example as you pointed
out on this chadwick smith likes to say
a lot
our rpe is ideal for sets of low reps
why because if you do a triple an rp7
doesn't mean you could do three more for
the love of fucking god that means you
might be able to do one more
but the last rep you did was very
comfortable also imagine singles
every single is not as hard as every
other single that does not mean every
single rp10
uh or rar zero uh every rpe seven single
means you actually only ever had a
single
you could not have done two reps but as
far as that single was concerned
it moved really well so rpe is best
for the rep ranges of uh
one to three peaking limit strength
range three to six basic strength
it is just fine for uh the hypertrophy
strength range it's a five to ten just
fine
oh so you can't use it there but i think
there in that set of
five to ten especially close to ten reps
rar starts to be
just more objective uh and thus better
uh and let me illustrate that with an
extreme of why rpd sucks
okay let's say you do a set of 22 in a
lat pull down great stimulus to fatigue
ratio
what rpe was that look i don't know it
felt hard but not so
eight seven what is the difference
between a seven and an eight who the
fuck knows
now how many rirs did you have how many
reps in reserve
oh well that's like you're like well
yeah i had like about three reps so for
anything
over 10 reps rar is absolutely superior
do not use rpe
for anything between 5 and ten dealer's
choice maybe james has some more insight
on which one
is best for whatever and then for under
six reps
uh rpe all the way forget rir because it
just doesn't tell you a fucking thing
anymore
james yeah that was great i think you
know rpe is definitely kind of the more
qualitative and then the rir
is more of a quantitative version of
doing relative effort this one's like
kind of how do i feel and this one's
like how many do i have
left and i think those rep ranges are
really good the only thing i would
really add is that rpe is really good
for
um not only for like a strength training
maximal strength stuff like that it's
good for like sport training and stuff
where you just have to gauge how much
how many rers were you in soccer james
right like how many uh how many
stars sprints did i do today you know
it's like
it's really just isn't very useful um
but like getting an idea of like okay
how hard should this practice this
activity at practice be today it should
be a 90
meaning like almost game pace you know
something on those lines that's where
it's really helpful
for like just doing weight training like
really basic stuff
it ends up being less helpful so you
could they're both scales of relative
intensity i think one's just more
qualitative one's a little bit more
quantitative
and i think as mike said like for the
more sporting it is like the more as you
get into like more athletic activities
and not just bodybuilding activities the
more
useful rpe is but i think rir is better
when you're doing more serious
weight training for the most part
excellent
next up is our man mantas philippe
from uh let's try m-a-n-t-a-s
there's only one mantis got it easy
okay so great question
he says it is believed that the minimum
threshold of trained power productively
is ninety percent of your own around
yeah right around there depends on what
the
activity is for sure and i think he's uh
power power production so
for like barbell movements yes for sure
for sure uh
would that 90 percent be of your true
1rm that would be achieved after a
proper peaking phase
or just a weight that you would be
confident to hit in almost any workout
some weeks due to fatigue from unplanned
activities the power output of my first
set of the workout is below 90
of my recent max which such training be
considered as junk volume so my first
answer to this james will do much better
answer um it's probably based on
your well-prepared average training max
not your peaked max well prepared you
feel good in training and you go all out
90 of that and remember it's a sliding
scale it's not exactly cut off of 90.
it's like much below 90s
much less effective right so i would say
the best way to think about it is just a
typical
good productive training day whatever
your 100 percent is
there like 90 of that can train
power okay as far as what your max peak
power is at 100
not of your peaked and tapered peak
power because then that's an
extraordinarily high figure that would
discount most training as effective but
the way you phrased your question he
said some weeks due to fatigue from
unplanned activities
you're having a real hard time getting
within 90 of your recent max
i would say that would also mean that
even if you're it wasn't a max but just
a really good effort
average training session if you're
sufficiently fatigued yeah you could
actually slip below 90
even of that after maybe one or two sets
which is to say
if you training for peak power
and you are pretty fatigued
good time to take a light session of
techniques i should go home rest sleep
recover eat
and back a day or two later train it
again because hypertrophy
endurance you can grind no matter what
you can be missing a fucking leg
and have great endurance adaptations you
can have the all fatigue in the world
and still make
great gains for hypertrophy less so but
you could still grind
strength less so you can still grind a
little power
speed a high level learning of technique
only occurs in low fatigue environments
so if you are fucked up yeah no you're
easily not as productive as you may
think you are
james yeah that was great answer i'm i'm
rereading the question and i might be
digging myself a hole here but the way
that i'm looking at this where he says
would it
would that 90 percent be of your true
1rm that would be achieved after a
proper
peaking phase so mike already touched on
that so it would be kind of like your
1rm
you know throughout most of the year not
your true peaking
like powerlifting weightlifting style
protocol peaking it would just be kind
of like what
would be like after two two mesos of
strength training what would your at one
rm
be kind of thing um and then it goes on
says so
uh power i'll put my first set um
oh no sorry be confident hitting almost
any workout so i'm wondering if you are
needlessly trying to
keep track of your power output for
non-power activities mike am i reading
too deeply into that
probably a little too deeply i mean you
could address that if you'd like but i
don't think i'm just wondering if he's
doing like uh you know maybe just some
like regular old strength training and
he's overly fussy about the power output
i think he's trying to do power training
and he's trying to measure peak power
so yeah for strength training you don't
have to be with a 90
of peak power but for power training it
probably should be
probably should be so one of the things
that you can do mantis if you
um if you are experiencing this so i
think what mike said is probably the
most important thing whereas if you
if you gas after like one set either
your work capacity is just
really poor and you're not prepared for
doing a lot of stimulative power
training at that point
or um you might just be carrying around
too much residual fatigue so you might
have to go back to the drawing board and
adjust some of those things maybe take a
couple light sessions so mike mike
nailed that part
another thing you might just have people
and this is just true you have some
people who are really fast twitch and
they they gas
after like one or two efforts despite
being in relatively good shape for their
uh sport or activity you might consider
moving into things like cluster sets
where you do one repetition take roughly
you know a 10 to 15 second break do
another repetition and then finish out
you know your set of
you know five reps or whatever it is
that you're doing and that sometimes
could be a little bit less
uh taxing in terms of like cardio and
systemic fatigue
during the workout that a lot might
allow you to get a couple more effective
sets in there at that higher power
threshold just
having a little bit of a break in
between each rep something that you
could do
probably the bigger issue though is like
uh are you are you in good enough shape
and or are you overly fatigued from
doing other activities
all right next up is
ali
okay i got looks like there's a bunch
oh wait no it's still live nope never
mind okay
ali just happens to
get a lot of control what the fuck was
talking about with saliva jesus
all right all right
hi docs thanks again for all your great
information for pulling muscles for
example biceps and hams
my reps drop significantly from set to
set to maintain the same rir
while pushing muscles triceps and quads
the reps stay almost the same between
sets to maintain the same rir this is
especially paired for isolation
exercises i've seen this referred to as
work capacity by meno
but yeah it's set to set work capacity
can the set descent drop be used as an
indicator to auto regulate my session
volume
for example that i reach my session mrv
and maybe i should stop training my
pulling muscles
uh and if true would it be better to
lower the session volume and increase
the training frequency for the low work
capacity muscles
to reach weekly volume targets um so we
i i will say so before you do this try
resting longer
and seeing how that changes some muscles
just require a little bit longer rest
and if you rest longer then all of a
sudden a set of set drop off isn't a big
deal
secondly if your stimulus to fatigue
ratio is still good
on the later sets that is you're getting
at least five reps
you're getting a decent addition to a
pump you're getting a good mind muscle
connection good tension perception you
feel like it's enough work to be doing
something
it doesn't really matter how big the
drop-off is as long as you can checklist
that the sfr is still good
if your drop-off is massive and this is
happening because of an unbelievable
amount of local and or systemic fatigue
to the point where you literally feel
like you're going through the motions
and your muscles are so exhausted you
can barely do anything
then yeah it's time to call it quits and
stop but some muscles
we'll do a set of 12 on the first set a
set of seven on their second
then seven then six then six and all the
way up to that fifth set of six
that's fucking great training that last
set of six that you did is fucking
awesome you're like oh my god
tons of tension i'm getting even more of
a pump great mind muscle connection
and i feel like weaker and more wiggly
you know my muscles are
feeling real hit up and disrupted more
and more every time
then these are still effective sets
right and then the question of when do
you stop is
due to other stuff so some muscles just
degrade faster than others
and i don't think we have the research
insight yet to say once a muscle falls
below xyz percent of its output then
it's you've got to stop training it
i'm not sure if that's the case and i
think it can go both ways now if it
falls
so much that it's below five reps even
if you rest for a while
and you're starting to lose a mind
muscle connection you really just don't
feel like you're getting a ton of
tension out of the muscle
like whatever reps you do get you feel
like you're at half mast more or less
then yeah you fuck that muscle up pretty
well and it's time to move on
so i think that using the degradation
in performance first of all is a huge
uh confounder is the amount of rest
you're taking between sets
so what we don't want you to do is oh i
just did two sets and i did 12 and a
half
six and i gotta stop because i can't do
any more you know the next set will be
four reps well if you rest an extra 30
seconds longer you get eight reps on the
next step it just turns out you weren't
resting long enough
so first of all try to play with the
rest and second of all try to ascertain
the stimulus to fatigue ratio
and essentially the raw stimulus
magnitude of each progressive set and if
the raw stimulus magnitude is good
i would say probably keep going and when
your mind muscle connection starts to go
then it's probably time to shut it down
yeah that was a really good answer and
just to build off that a little bit i
mean you can
you can use some of that stuff to auto
regulate some things within a session
and something that i have done with
myself and my clients
is sometimes like if your rep drop off
drops below your goal reps then you can
use that as an indicator
that it's time to do either down sets or
maybe move on to a new exercise maybe
you still have a few sets to fill in
your mrv
quota um but you're basically out of the
the rep range that you set for the
exercise so maybe it's time
to get a different exercise going and
see if you can get an enhanced pump and
mind muscle connection
doing something else um so those are
things that you can do though i i would
have the same skepticism that mike had
to say why don't you try a few other
things before you just
throw the baby out with the bath water
on some of them
just because you're getting tired like
for for
strength it's much easier because as
soon as you get out of your rep range
it's a very tight rep range you're
fucking done
as soon as you can't lift the loads
you're supposed to if you need you're
done
for hypertrophy more is a little better
and some muscles just fatigue really
fast but they can benefit from more work
now on average
muscles that fatigue less are slower
twitch and can benefit from more
progressive sets
muscles that fatigue a ton are faster
twitch and probably don't need as much
water but that's not the hard rule that
we
would want to use as an auto regulator
something you definitely keep in mind
but that like uh stimulus to fatigue the
mind muscle connection
and if it goes below five reps i think
those uh other indices are a little bit
better and can be used in addition
to the rep drop off to really inform
whether or not we want to stop
next up is letter j letter r both
capitals
one space apart got it
all right he says i think this uh from
last week when it was uploaded again
we didn't answer last week so we go last
time question recommendations for a
strength block question mark that's
actually uh jr what do you mean i'm
going to be super dick it's folks we're
not fucking c
but that's actually not a question uh
uh there is you put a question mark at
the end of it but uh
that recommendations for our strength
block yes we have a book called
scientific principle and strength
training
you should read it it has all of those
recommended
nations you just set yourself up for
that one jr i'm sorry
yeah we had it coming but uh all
seriousness his real question is
straight sets of five for compounds
using percentages or do you recommend
progressing through the measure using
rir
average of roughly five reps example
three sets of squats on
day one of week one three rar for seven
five three reps or is there a
pre-existing pro
as user recommend my answer is actually
very simple you can use rir
but rp is totally fine you can use um
different reps every single set or the
same
reps every single set just different
loads or even the same loads and a
slightly different rpe
just the average rpe has to be a a
certain number for the sets and
should hit your target like so for
example an rp7 rp8 an rpd 9 set
of 5 5 at the same low 200 pounds each
time
averages to an rp8 and that's totally
fine honestly i think
the best answer you get from me probably
james is whatever method you pick stick
to that one for a few message cycles and
see how it goes
the the two only things that matter are
one
you set yourself up with a decent
baseline and
two you easily logically
and marginally progressed over the
course of multiple weeks if you do both
of those
and it's by adding weight instead of
adding reps because it's for strength
training
your fucking money and the exact way in
which you do it uh really doesn't matter
a whole lot
yeah i totally agree um i think you can
you can use rir
for you know like a strength block or
power lifting kind of training but
it's not so much like a using it for
programming it's so much just ensuring
that you're not blowing your load
prematurely in your meso right so if
you're doing you know
if you said okay four sets of you know
roughly fives maybe like four to six
reps right you could just do five five
five
uh you know wear four sets of five but
one of those is going to be like rp you
know ir321 maybe even
zero at one point so for me i would
rather allow the reps to be variable and
then just use
rir in the back of my mind like let's
just not drop below
one or two rir for the first one or two
weeks maybe
weeks three or four we might entertain
going to one ir maybe even zero
on one set but um i'm not necessarily
using that from a programming standpoint
so much as just like a
fatigue i guess you call it fatigue
management but just making sure that the
relative effort
never exceeds whatever the kind of goal
rpe for that session
is so you just leave a little if you're
if you're more quantitatively thinking
about your sets because you're used to
using oir
you can keep doing that as long as it is
reflective of the rpe that you had set
for that session
if that makes sense exactly all right
next up is adas 450 d-a-z
dude control f is a fucking miracle
worker here
yeah we're so stupid that it took us
that long to figure it out
super stupid folks we have
phds in sport physiology and not
medicine or something else
yeah something real uh all right uh
as i tell people my wife's an actual
doctor i'm a pretend doctor
adas450 says
when progressing in amazon if you match
reps but add one set
is that enough progress or would you
want
to add at least one rep on the sets
before adding one
before the added one so this is
something uh eric helms
and uh and brian miner are very good
about seeing
in their skepticism towards our
progression methods
uh i would say this is you know once we
understood each other better this is no
longer skepticism there's but it is a
fallacy people make and
is being committed here to some extent
adding sets
is not a form of is not a detection of
progression
it is a causative increase in stimulus
but it doesn't you if you're actually
progressing or not it doesn't for sure
guarantee
that you're expanding the quality
stimulus so if you add a set
then later in the week yeah you're
dealing with more fatigue
but maybe you're just good at handling
and it's not really clear if you're
actually
making the workouts harder so adding
stuff on the back end
quite the same thing there is no
replacement for the following
in a progression adding load with the
same reps
or reps with the same load or some
additive combination of both
each set has to be more impressive than
last time
then if that stops you've hit mrv if you
just add a bunch of sets but your sets
are actually
the same what ends up happening is you
could just be doing really good at
getting
some assets and your rir could be uh
rising the whole time like it used to be
two rs now three rar
and then you're just practicing doing
lots of work that's not high quality
so if you uh
add one set but you do uh but you match
reps it's not
progress it's constancy as we're
concerned it might
connote some underlying progress but
it's not sure enough of the things
we need it's almost like this
if you took a test of your say math
abilities and you could study and get
better at this test
testing you got a 90 then you took a
test uh months later
that you were really deprived right uh
for that test for the fir
this test you were and you got a 90
again are you for sure better at math
yeah maybe but we're not trying to deal
in babies
would for sure tell you about it math
ready 91
or above so this exact thing this is how
james and i are real big uh advocates of
a proactive
overload policy every time you come to
the gym same session next week you
add a rep or you add some weight or you
have some measure of both
sets but in a regulated fashion based on
your volume responses am i getting pumps
am i getting so aren't bringing so
forth they are not a metal internal
quality progression that has to happen
on the difficulty front
because then you for sure know if you're
getting better you don't have to second
guess like oh am i just getting better
at doing sets but i never got
stronger uh or am i actually getting
under the
better performance more of a challenge
more of a challenge and then eventually
i hit my movie
james yeah that was really good and just
to kind of play a little devil's
efficacy here for the sake of discussion
this is really helpful
particularly at the mev stage of your
training block and then maybe in the
first couple weeks
what you might find is that your
performance might actually get
stabilized as you get into the latter
half of your mesocycle because you're so
dialed into that mav zone wherever you
are and you might find that you might
not actually be making a ton
of progress in reps or load on bar and
is that necessarily a bad thing
no it's definitely something that you
want i would also
say that if you are constantly seeing
week to week progressions
right on most of your lifts it probably
means you have some extra room in there
to do a little bit more
at the same time so you can kind of look
at it both ways and say like
you should be aiming to progress but you
should also be aiming to train so hard
that that progress sometimes gets masked
by the fatigue because you're training
so hard right and then it comes out
later
so there's kind of a middle ground where
we're looking for things like mevs and
maybe
mavs in the early part of a mesocycle
looking for those rep and load
progressions is really helpful to
confirm that what you did a couple weeks
ago
was on point and then later on if you
are still getting good pumps still
getting good soreness still getting good
disruptions but those things start to
stabilize
but all the other indicators like we
mentioned are are doing well then you're
probably dialed in to write wherever you
need to be
i think having the goal of adding reps
and adding
load is definitely should be in the back
of your mind even if it doesn't always
manifest
all right jordan herrera
oops got it
hi docs i finally psychologically
instead of physiologically usually
at week four to five of a month cycle
and my physical recovery is great
at such we not feel closer to any
particular muscle groups of rv
then i find myself to recover mentally
to get back into the game
and swing of things to be able to train
hard any less
to instead of having to de-load due to
reaching muscle mrv
and have logarithm metacycle with more
overloading weak so first off just gonna
erase this right now there is no
convincing reason to think
that a mesocycle of longer than four or
five weeks of accumulation is better
than a mesocycle
of four or five weeks of accumulation um
you make great progress during your
deload through delayed adaptation
and uh at the end of the day there's
lots of research showing that even a
three to one paradigm
has roughly the same long-term effect uh
fuck was that study it was like a 12 d
is not time spent getting worse it's not
time spent um
uh getting no results it's time spent
recharging regrouping and growing it's a
fucking good
thing and i would put my a lot of my
scientific was on the line
saying whatever benefits you have if
anything
better than a four to one parent is just
not going to be barely detectable worth
it or even existent
anymore it's like saying okay i work
fucking
champ i'm amazing at my work i work six
days a week
i take one day off i don't figure out
how to drop the drugs to work
seven you just don't get any of that
seventh day you're better off going
sitting on a beach relaxing recharging
it as a matter of fact on an
intellectual front
uh james is familiar with this a lot of
your best ideas coalesce
when you're not struggling to express
them and organize them on paper
just reaction your brain rewires itself
and then better things happen just the
same in a deload a lot of that stuff
happens so
i know you're looking at your four or
five week metacycle you're thinking fuck
logically fuck up i could do six or
seven or eight weeks there's nobody jack
doing that shit
it's the jack people are trained
properly they can only survive four or
five weeks
it's okay there's no big plus sign but
you do say
correctly there's a concern that you're
not reaching your muscle mrv
individually he
says i'm a beginner by the way i've yet
to feel any mrv and over and get
overreached
i suspect i may be on the slower twitch
side of things could be wrong thanks for
the
favorite fitness channel thank you so
much jordan my best
recommendation to you is to try to do a
prioritization program
where you maybe put half or two-thirds
of your muscles a burner
and maybe half for a third of your
muscles on the back burner just at
maintenance volume
and then you still have the same
systemic four or five weeks and you want
you to increase the volume
more and smash those fucking muscles
that are on the front burner to see if
you detect any local mrvs if you do
great then you're training them to full
two or three mesos later a block later
you switch the muscles that your front
back burner and you go again
that's probably my best answer for you
yeah that was really good i'm gonna
i'm gonna do a little skeptical james
here but you'll appreciate where i'm
going in a minute um so you said that
i am a beginner by the way and so one
thing if we're taking you at your word
if you're a beginner and you're limiting
your limiting factor is basically your
systemic fatigue you gotta back down
a lot because you're training needlessly
hard my friend you could probably back
down substantially and make the exact
same gains that you are now
however the conundrum that you're
describing
is not a beginner problem it is the
intermediate conundrum
where i can no longer train to my muscle
mrvs because systemic fatigue is the
limiting factor this is classic like
intermittent aging
yeah so in if if that is the case
which i kind of suspect maybe it is and
maybe you're just not giving yourself
enough credit
um then you kind of move into the
specialization phases like mike said
where you consider putting things that
either mev or
maybe even mv for certain things another
thing to consider
independent of all those is that you
might just be having a lot of systemic
spillover from the
exercises that you're choosing so you
i'm not saying that you're doing this
but for example let's just say you were
using
a lot of deadlifts a lot of low bar
squats and a lot of flat benching
maybe it's time just explore some other
options that don't have quite the
systemic fatigue spillover as some of
those other ones
going along with that like trying to
find good sfr choices
for all those different muscle groups so
if you haven't thought about sfr
maybe now's a good time to think about
it because you might be just like man
i've been doing sets of eight on the
bench forever and
i'm it's fine but man i'm always tired
why don't you do some sets of 15 on some
table flies see how that goes right like
try those things those are doing sets of
eight on the deadlift and low bar squat
and it's like
what are we here for are we just trying
for no reason
got a lot of things to think about on
that
boom
[Music]
all right last question for the day
is from adrian i'm not going to try that
last name
astarbayan oh my god
yeah exactly
there you go nice little little spicy
accent on there
[Music]
so uh he asks a really interesting
question which would be great for us to
leave off on
do you think building rewards tendencies
because some of the top bodybuilding
would do whatever it takes to win
sacrifice their health social life
uh even um life in some cases a lot of
core guys talk about the gym like it's
there keeping them from going crazy and
murdering people live
so just just to be clear psychopathy is
a very different thing than what you're
describing
psychopathy is a failure to see uh an
emotionality and
sense an emotionality and theory of mind
and other people
apathy like okay so like if you
see a video of a goat crossing the
street and it gets hit by a car and it
goes
he gets the stop sign and dies and
there's a baby goat next to it that's
it's mommy and it's like
mommy won't wake up if that doesn't
target your heart strings at all if
you're not at least like oh
fuck like that sucks if you just watch
that you're like
it goes bad and you like feel like that
and at best you just feel nothing
you're a fucking psychopath right so
that's very different
than a one-minded attraction towards
working super hard at some things i
wouldn't call that psychopathic
but we can call that incredibly selfish
um incredibly
one-sided and incredibly even myopic
like
the fa you know did the detriment things
not psychopathic because
psychopathy is a very specific
definition right if you're like willing
to slip the throat of your competitor in
the back room at a prejudging
you're a psychopath if you're not you're
just willing to train and die and take
tons of drugs
yeah exactly a psychopath maybe but uh
there's a different different
terminology here but
do we think bodybuilding works like
pathogens no
do i think that bodybuilding rewards the
tendencies of a single-minded brutal
focus
fuck yeah does but i will say it is
absolutely no different from almost
every other sport
at the very top have a dedication
that they're the very best at their
sport that is usually unrivaled
if you want to see the preeminent
example of this maybe the best example
ever
go on netflix and watch the last dance
documentary about michael jordan in the
chicago bulls
michael jordan would have been amazing
at every sport he ever tried whatever
his genetics allowed which is a lot um
except for basically for sure
his minor league that's so fucked up his
minor league coach was saying
he was like he still played professional
baseball which is better dude
his minor league coach was saying that
he was getting good so fast towards the
end of his baseball thing that he was
going to be going to the pros like he
was going to be a major league
and that's insane this is fucking crazy
right so so here's the thing
because he had like an adjustment period
and then he just did one of those jordan
things he did where he like exponential
learning curve and you're like oh fuck
he's going to be
amazing at this too so but the thing is
for jordan yes physically he's
unbelievably gifted about as gifted as
many other athletes have been but his
true edger was in psychology
he would literally yell at other hall of
famers in practice when
they were skirting five percent of the
effort off their max
who the fuck does that you would call he
would come to people's houses in the
middle of the night
wake him up to go to practice physically
find
dennis rodman in a bender and drag him
out of clubs and put him in a fucking
here's water
shut the fuck up get hydrated we got
less than three hours
i mean like that's in focus and
the way he discusses is like truly like
spine tingling uh that kind of thing
rewards the best bodybuilders as well
and that's absolutely a thing and if you
want to be really great it's not gonna
have to give it your all
you're gonna have to obsess about it uh
great not good
not very good great and that's okay what
we would just say
is make sure you don't trade off the
rest of your life so much
that you're not okay with the trade-off
like uh if you're like man i had this
beautiful family and these beautiful
i ignore them and now i'm the best than
that but honestly i look back at the
last 40 years
and i just wish i had hung out with my
friends more you don't want to be in
that position
so be a human being be an intelligent
person and think about it beforehand
like me i'm faced with all sorts of
choices about how far i want to push my
bodybuilding career
how many sports supplements i want to
take what kind of health trade-offs do i
want
uh and uh i've given that a lot of
thought and i'm comfortable currently
with the choices i'm making and the
choices i plan to make
but i never make any choices where i'm
like i'm gonna do this but it's gonna
cost me in a way i don't want that you
shouldn't do so you should always look
forward
yeah it's weird i mean like it was it's
funny to laugh at like the psychotic
behavior
because it's kind of a joke and cheeky
way of phrasing it but there are so it's
clearly not
actual psychosis but it does kind of
fall into some def what i would call
like negative
psychological effects i think physique
sports in general tend to either
attract a certain crowd who is already
predisposed to things like body
dysmorphia or eating disorders or
in some ways might exacerbate them i
think that's true i can't back that up
with any you know obsessive
stuff yeah but i think it either makes
that worse for normal people or just
attracts crowds who are already
predisposed to that kind of behavior
and finds it you know obvi rewarding or
i can't relate to it i'm not sure
so i think there is there's definitely
that i think there is kind of like um
you know i say this respectfully because
as mike said most most people who are
high achievers in sport go through the
same process there is like a degree of
narcissism that is involved especially
since it is a single competition sport
your world largely revolves around you
and you alone and
that can push a lot of people like
friends and families and other people
that would otherwise enrich your life in
many different ways
away and that can kind of suck so i do
think that it is kind of a weird niche
thing it does come with some
psychological baggage
um i think it's just like how nfl
linemen have to transition out of being
lineman and many of them fail to do the
so and become you know giant obese turds
people have to transition effectively
out of bodybuilding and get back into
living in the real world and having
relationships and not fussing over diet
and exercise all the time these are
things that
it's not easy to do it's hard you know
it has to be done and not many people
get a lot of guidance so
i think it does come with baggage i
think there's probably effective ways to
deal with that i just don't think that
we've quite figured that out yet
boom folks we have today those are the
10 questions
all right very nice uh dr mike anything
fun or interesting coming up and i know
we always have a stream of videos coming
but is anything that
really tickled your pickle yeah
deloading video a lot of people have
been asking for it we just put up a
video about how to deload
general theory and practical
recommendations um
but fucking months ago because we knew
you guys wanted it super soon but
there's a big queue
we only release about three or four
videos per week and people just can't
um so we have a huge cube videos but the
d loading video is something i think you
guys are
a lot of people let me ask you questions
it's just super basic it solves a lot of
problems
very fun so i have good news for all of
you i've took it i
i've taken i took my uh at least my last
formal editing pass at the hypertrophy
book and i've passed it off to mel so
i've read that book probably like four
times over at this point
it's gone through numerous edits and
iterations so i think
at this point uh it might maybe you and
i can talk for one minute after this is
over
we got to go through one more quick
round of edits um but largely it's done
and then it's going to go to the book
processing and figure making and then
after that we take a final pass at it
it's pretty much done so
good news folks that's it
all right folks see you next time
