hey folks dr mike isratel here last week
we talked about breaking through
strength plateaus and we gave you 10
tips of how to do it
today we talk about how to break through
muscle gain plateaus you just can't put
on the size that you want or any size at
all
what do you do about it we actually have
10 tips plus an eleventh
modifier tip let's get right into it
troubleshooting guide number one you got
to make sure you actually have a plateau
what that means is sometimes people have
really unrealistic rates of muscle gain
and weight gain and they think they're
failing when they're actually wildly
successful
for example i had somebody probably
think i still
told a story before i had somebody
message me i think on instagram i don't
check dms on instagram by the way i
don't know how fuck they got through
uh and they were like hey listen i'm
fucking stalled out i can't gain any
muscle i can't get any weight
and i was like okay i started chatting
with them it was a longer chat
at some point i found out that stuff
wasn't adding up they were eating a ton
of calories and they were feeling
stuffed all the time and i was like
i decided they asked the question like
so have you gained any weight in the
last two months because you know
we were under the assumption that there
was zero gain and he was like well yeah
i've been gaining like
uh like a pound half a pound to a pound
every week
and i'm like that's the fucking ideal
rate of gains what the hell are you
talking about
and the person replied in all honesty
they were like
i thought it was supposed to be at least
a pound and i'm like oh my
fuck a lot of times we get these crazy
ideas in our head that if we're not
wildly successful like ifb pros who put
on 40 pounds of muscle a year or
whatever
that we're failing look if you put on
five ten pounds of muscle a year that's
fucking good so a lot of times if you
can't gain
make sure it's camp gain and not just
gaining slow listen if you're gaining
slow you can always
you know move some things around eat a
bit more food train a bit harder and
follow these other tips to get a little
higher gain rate but at the end of the
day if you have good gain rate going
you're on the right track fundamentally
and there's nothing foundationally wrong
with what you're doing look
if you haven't gained any weight or any
muscle or any rep strength
in months there's something critically
wrong with what you're doing
but if you've gained only just slower
than you used to maybe it's because you
transitioned from being a beginner to an
intermediate
give that some thought so make sure you
actually have a plateau of no gains for
a while before you
freak out and try to address the matter
because you could be doing a lot of shit
right just keep doing it right
on the subject of doing it right point
number two consistency
in training and huge consistency in diet
if i talk to someone they're like hey
can i like troubleshoot you like i
haven't been getting blah blah i'm like
what's your training been like like well
when i make it to the gym like
pause what do you mean when you make it
to the gym like well i haven't been
super consistent i get the fuck out of
my face
now that's all jokes aside
if you can't say you're actually
executing a plan how the fuck are we
gonna criticize that plan
right like you know you come back and
tell someone like someone goes say hey
go go
go talk to that girl here's what you can
say and she'll be nice to you and you'll
get a date and they come back like it
didn't work
like okay so you told her what i told
you and it didn't work like well no i
didn't
really say what you said i said some
other shit i'm like okay
so my shit did not work you're a fucking
idiot what the hell are you doing like i
freaked out and just started mumbling
and like
you know extinct latin and my head
started turning you know satan shit i
thought she'd be into that
here's the deal folks if you're not
consistent in your training
if you're not consistent in your diet
you can even be training amazingly and
jack shit
will happen to you consistency first
a lot of you watching this are coaches
and personal trainers i highly recommend
that when people come to you and
consistency is their problem
that's the only fucking problem once you
solve that
eight out of ten times they get fucking
great gains anyway
for the two out of 10 people that are
consistent with training a diet and
still have plateaus
we have the other possible fixes fix
number three
fatigue management needs to be aligned
on the passive side
with sleep and stress management
physical and emotional stress if
someone's not sleeping well
and if they are physically and
emotionally stressed out like the tons
of exams they're studying for they're
just a total wreck
like my wife had gone through medical
school for a fucking generation
should takes forever and she still made
some pretty decent gains in the gym
but like you know if she was upset with
the rate of gains i would remind her on
occasion like maybe you're going through
this thing this is
insane you work like 100 hours a week
you barely sleep
you know there's only so much you can
expect because what a lot of people will
do is they'll go through crazy shit or
they'll have a ton of stress in their
lives or they won't be sleeping
and then they'll be guards like i don't
sleep right what can i do with my
program to obviate that there's no
fucking answer that question
like there's just not like it's like a
wrestler being like all right
i shot myself in the leg how can i
wrestle this next match
and not have to pay the price like i
guess don't push off that leg and don't
let the other guy know you have a
fucking gunshot wound in there
maybe but like there's a strategy to
like optimize within that constraint
but the best thing to do is just not
fucking being a constraint it's like
this
better analogy if i was gonna fight a
bear with my bare hands what's the best
way
to to do it so i don't get killed i got
a better idea stay the fuck away from
bears with their bare hands
bear spray shotgun or better yet stay
the hell away from bears all the other
that's the best way to do it so the bear
in that analogy is like
not sleeping and being sort of
emotionally wrecked from tons of anxiety
if that's the case solve that shit first
and then
you know how to win against a bear is a
real easy checklist of don't fucking
fight why don't you win every day that
you're alive right
so make sure you get those things
handled because they are massive and
they just
really shit into your training and the
reason i'm really big
on harping on this is that a ton of
people will just assume those things are
normal part of life they shouldn't have
to be in most cases
sometimes they have to be and then don't
worry about training a ton because
you've got to take care of some shit
most of the times they just assume like
what's whatever and
if somebody's sufficiently brilliant
coaches me they're going to be able to
make me a champion even in light of the
shit the fact that i don't fucking sleep
and then i'm whipped out of my mind
worrying about shit the thing is high
level professional athletes they don't
have the shit in their lives there's a
reason
the bulgarians lived in training camps
there's a reason like just chicago bulls
when they play basketball they fucking
shout everything out and they do what
they do
because that shit sleep has to be a
thing you get
and stress management has to be a thing
that's just the state the
state of the matter number four make
sure
that you're training within your volume
landmarks for each muscle group which is
different from each muscle group
between the minimum effective volume the
minimum you need to actually make gains
and the maximum recoverable the most you
can recover from training any less than
any
more than that is by definition going to
get you zero fucking gains
if you don't know what those are if you
have never heard about maximum recovery
volume or the volume landmarks
google the fuck out of that shit youtube
that shit because it's important it's
not that complicated right
but it's worth a look because each
muscle has a range of training volumes
like number of sets per week or per
session
that it responds to best other volumes
outside of that that response do not so
well
and still other volumes to which it
doesn't respond at all you could be
doing someone else's program or some
shit you found online or some shit you
developed yourself
and it could be on that either shitty
range or the ranger that doesn't work at
all and then everything else you could
be doing sleeping super well blah blah
all this and that super scientific
training it could be
completely lost because that one
variables are you can have the best
bomber plane in the fucking world b2
spirit or whatever next gen
auto shit is going to replace that and
it doesn't fucking matter how awesome it
is
if the target is here and that
motherfucker is flying that way all
right
that's the thing with volume landmarks
there's a zone in which the ship works
and if you're outside of that zone it
doesn't work at all how do you fix this
usually start on the lower end a lot of
people do too much
a lot of this demographic you watching
this video chances are you're training
pretty fucking hard it could be just a
little bit too hard too much volume
start lower because i'll tell you this
at worst you'll maintain your gains
losing gains is almost fucking
impossible if you train remotely hard
like with a couple of sets a week
you won't lose your gains maybe you'll
just maintain and then you'll know i
need more volume than i thought
start low and slowly work up over time
and for the other people that are under
training
when you work up in volume try to work
up to your true
maximum recovery volume which means you
get a lack of gains of performance and
maybe even a dip
the dip's optional but a lack of gains
so some people will do like
this much volume and they'll get gains
and then they'll do this much and then
they'll deload
and look okay so why did you just work
up to 12 sets a week and then deload
you just get tired and they're like uh
well yeah like
that's it okay that's fine
but why not work up to your true mrna
because
this range you explored could have been
that first part of the okay range
it could be this range of volume up here
that gives you your best games
you've never even gone up to it and you
could say some shit like well that's
crazy i'd have to do like
24 sets of like quads a week and be like
yeah some people have maximum recovery
volumes
that are in the 30s and 40s they're rare
but they happen you might be one of them
which is why the fuck you are the one
with a platoon everybody else and their
grandmother is making fucking gains out
here
you'd be like okay you're right
sometimes
if you do some work and you don't feel
super tired even if you feel tired but
your performance is still going up
slowly gradually with occasional deloads
keep going up in volume
i want all of you to try at least once
to get up to a level of volume in which
your performance starts to stutter and
then flatline
that's probably your mrv then you never
fucking have to do that much volume ever
again
because that's the top end and then you
know that everything below that
is either the correct volume answer or
much lower than that maybe not correct
but you know that range below mrv and
all the way down
is there's a really good range of where
you're going to make your best gains and
if that doesn't fix your game problem
it's one of these other things that are
a problem and the volume is not the
problem because a lot of times
fundamentally people are doing enough
volume it's this other shit they get
caught up
next one big one dr james hoffman from a
regular weekly webinars is huge on this
make sure the chosen exercises you're
doing for hypertrophy
have high stimulus to fatigue ratios
especially high raw stimulus magnitudes
which means what a bunch of like
dumbass science talk you get an
attention in the target muscle
okay if you're doing curls your biceps
won't grow and i ask you where the fuck
you feel the curls you know i feel a ton
of tension in my forearms i'm like okay
what about your biceps like nope if you
don't feel tension
in the fucking target muscle how hell
you think that you're gonna generate
growth which is generated by tension
this shit doesn't make any sense
you got to feel tension on the target
muscle and for high reps
the burn should be in the target muscle
if you're doing walking lunges to get
bigger quads and it's not working
and i'm like so when you're doing sets
of like 25 lunges like close to failure
where do you feel the burn you're like
my glutes
okay but why are you doing them for
quads like well mechanically like
mechanically in theory shady theory
and hypothesis it works but it turns out
lots of muscles can take over for other
muscles and even though the joint is
articulating it could be coming
the energy and the force could be coming
from another joint that's related to it
right you can lunge with pushing
almost exclusively through your glutes
and adductors that's definitely a
possibility
the other thing is super common too
where people are lunging for their
glutes
and for high rep lunges they never get a
burn in their glutes it's just their
quads they're
surprised that their glutes aren't
growing but but i'm doing all these
lunges well do you feel the burn on your
glutes do you feel tension in your
glutes like no
like okay there's no tension no burnout
you're betting that you're gonna grow
muscle
that's strange isn't it then yeah i
guess it is pump it's a good one none of
these are for sure but all of them help
if you're training your chest and you're
getting no chest pumps ever
fuck man i can't guarantee you're gonna
be growing muscle if you're getting
chest pumps and you're getting
tension in the burner in the chest look
maybe it's another issue because clearly
you're fucking your shit up which is
good and on the fucking shit up part
disruption in the target muscle
if you tell me you have trouble growing
your quads and i ask you okay so how
long you sore for after quad workouts
you're like well i don't really get sore
my quads
ah we found a problem if you've never
been sore
there's no evidence that you've ever
done too much because a lot of times
when you get super sore it's a bit too
much
but if you've never done too much
possibly you've never done enough
like you just have no idea that you may
be under doing it by a long shot and the
exercises
may be shitty and your technique may be
shitty so technique is huge here
not only do we want you to pick the
right exercises zap you for example
say man low bar squats i've been using
it for quads i don't feel my fucking
quads at all
they don't get sore i tried hack squats
and they fuck my quads up but
hack squatting is a machine and a pussy
exercise and i stopped doing it what the
fuck is wrong with you
go to the exercises that are the most
effective they give you
the biggest tension the biggest burning
high reps the biggest pump and the
biggest disruption of the target muscle
shit fucks you up you can hardly walk
you can hardly move your chest and then
it gets sore later
then you know you're doing a good job
right pick the right exercises and
tweak your technique within exercises to
make sure you get it so if you bench
like this flat back then your chest
doesn't feel shit
okay arch and retract and all of a
sudden your chest gets blown up now
you're onto something your technique is
better
this might require some exercise
deletion and replacement
if you can't take an exercise like
dumbbell press and alter the technique
to feel your chest
get fucking rid of dumbbell press
remember there are no magic exercises in
hypertrophy training there's only what
works
and if you tried dumbbell press and you
tried barbell press it really doesn't
hit your chest even when you tried a
bunch of different techniques
and you try machine press lame i know
and it fucking zaps your shit
you're gonna be machine pressing let me
ask you a question
uh flex wheeler ronnie coleman
uh marcus rule that's a really good one
marcus rule look up his chest what it
looks like
what did he do for chest first of all
you probably don't know and second of
all was mostly machines
but his chest was enormous nobody gives
a shit you're looking at hypertrophy
you can get an unbelievable physique
with some weird shit if you just happen
to have like a weird fucking body and
nobody cares
because getting jacked is the only thing
that matters can you imagine seeing
fucking dieseled out dude
big ass pecs in the gym and you're like
fuck
and your buddy's like yeah but he never
fucking benches so fuck him you're like
right on can you get the fuck out of my
face i want to know what this guy's
doing
who gives a shit right if you give a
shit about strength exercises matter
you want to be a big bench presser
there's no way around it if you want big
packs you got to pick the
movements the techniques and the
machines that work the best
it's not your choice it's your discovery
if shit happens to work for you
fucking do it that's it number six
another really big one
people miss this one a lot make sure the
stimulus to fatigue ratio is highest
through the right rep range selections
okay we have a five to ten rep range the
10 to 20 rep range in the 20 to 30 rep
range generally
a lot of times people will say about
exercises or even movements or even
muscle groups
should just doesn't work for me man hold
up a sec i used to say some shit like
that about cable rows i would try to do
cable rows so it's a five to ten it
didn't do a fucking thing
so it couldn't generate a ton of force
that wasn't really stable i tried doing
cable rows with sets of 20 to 30 the
ship
blew my back up i was ready to write off
cable rules all together
but apparently that wasn't a thing there
is a lot of times some muscles prefer
rep ranges my chest and my hamstrings
for example
love the heavy range 5 to ten the best
10 to 15 they do well
anything above 15 is works okay for me
uh anything above 20 is mostly like but
for short sprints here and there a waste
of fucking time they just get tired
on the other hand other muscles for
myself like my delts they respond super
super
well to much higher reps like i could be
doing sets of five to ten for adults and
just have a mystery as to why the fuck
my shoulders aren't big but i would try
sets of 10 to 20 and 20 to 30 my
shoulders are blown
so make sure you're exploring rep ranges
and seeing which ones give you
the best tension the best burn the best
pumps and the best disruption
in that rep range and tailor your rep
ranges a little bit more
to the actual ones that give you more of
that shit
than less of that shit plain and simple
number seven big one
this one is a more long-term one it's
probably more important than a bunch of
the ones that came first but it's more
long-term
so i listed it a little bit later being
hypercaloric which means in a state of
excess calorie so that you can gain
weight
in gaining phases isn't that funny
hypercaloric in a fucking gain phase
and adding net body weight over months
and years that's the long term part
here's the thing if you weigh 150 pounds
you can get pretty fucking jacked at
150. like if you're a midget height like
me i'm like five six or some shit
after you get to 150 you can't and you
get to like
say 10 or some 10 body fat where the
fuck you supposed to get more jacked
from people that go just fucking recomp
to what another 150-pounder with all due
respect
if you're five six and 150 you can get
pretty jacked but you can't get really
jacked
because there's nobody five-six who's
really jacked at 150 fucking physically
impossible
because jack requires size right if the
hulk was seven feet tall
but weighed 120 pounds you wouldn't have
big fucking muscles they weigh something
so if you are a certain body people do
this whole time like man i can't figure
out why it won't grow and i'm like okay
so the last time you did a mass gaining
phase how heavy did you get and they're
like i don't do mass gaining phase i
just like maintain
all right on you know maintaining means
your muscles are gonna be about the same
size
they might grow a little bit but then as
you get lean enough they're not gonna
you're not gonna go from six percent fat
to three percent fat as your muscles
grow this is just not really fucking
possible
so what are you gonna do some point you
gotta eat more food and fucking gain the
weight
there's no way to get 200 pounds jacked
without weighing 200 pounds
if you ate 160 you know if i can put on
your sailor's hat
and look over the mast and be like that
way
towards 200 that's where we need to go
so the only way to do that is a
hyper-caloric diet
some people won't even track their
fucking macros and be like man i can't
gain weight i'm like well how much food
are you eating
well like a lot like we'll just give you
the numbers don't go i don't know the
numbers
right on so you're a fucking liar to
yourself not to just me
because you don't know if you're eating
a lot because a lot has a fucking number
next to it now if someone tells me like
i eat
five thousand calories a day first of
all they're probably fucking lying but
if they tell me that shit then i'm like
oh okay we have something to work with
and a lot of times it's really funny
people imagine for sure you guys get
messages like this where people are like
something's not not right i'm doing all
this shit right i'm like okay let's say
i believe you
right a lot of skepticism here i'm
channeling james hoffman and they're
like i'm eating 4
000 calories a day and i weigh 160 and i
can't gain weight
and the funniest advice i give was a
little tongue-in-cheek but it's actually
true
i'm like okay i gotcha uh if you're
doing everything like you're saying i
believe you
it's time to eat 4 500 calories and
they're like that's fucking hard man
like no shit did you think gaining
weight was going to be easy
a lot of times being hyper caloric means
you get a little fatter in the short
term that fucking sucks it means you
stuff yourself with fucking sucks it
means you feel sick
sucks but all that suck
gives you all that mass then you're
jacked and nobody can make fun of you
anymore because you're scary
point number seven give it some thought
point number eight
training side fatigue management things
like
deloads active rests low volume phases
if you've never done that shit before
it could be that you're carrying a lot
of excessive fatigue when you start
doing it it really lines up your
training everything syncs and you make
awesome long-term progress and people
are just grinding themselves down they
just don't know about it i've done this
for a really long time
if you're not sure if you're doing this
take a de-load look up what our how to
take a de-load video on rp youtube
and um take a de-load and start with
lower volumes and see if you get better
because if you're
carrying excessive fatigue as soon as
you deload or drop it down a ton and if
you start with lower volumes like maybe
60 or 50 of the number of sets you were
doing and slowly raised them up you may
get amazing gains and then the answer to
your question of what was wrong was
you might have been training with too
much of volume but probably just for too
long without a break
so it's definitely a thing right like if
you notice someone in the office that's
like papers everywhere and their suit
ties frayed and like oh my god i can't
get anything done i'm making all these
mistakes
maybe the first question you asked is
like when's the last time you took a day
off or slept
like i haven't slept in three days i
gotta get this done like okay let's do
next week why don't you go home
and take like a day or two and just
relax and watch netflix and sleep a ton
and eat they'll come back they'll have a
fresh mind and they'll make
they'll finish the project by wednesday
and they'll be out of the door and it'll
be awesome right
it's just a thing like if you see
someone freight out you give them a
break just the same way in training a
lot of people are grind grind grind
and a lot of us who grind it i'm one of
those people think that the solution
to when you're not gaining while
grinding is more grinding sometimes
that's true sometimes it's not the only
way to find out is take a de-load and if
it makes you better turns out you're
working too hard for too long no big
deal
number nine push each accumulation
phase until performance gains stop so
some people
they'll train hard for four weeks and
then they'll deload
and you'll say to them okay so you
earned that d load now you're pretty
fucked up and then
i got tired like okay so you were still
adding a rep here and there or adding
two and a half or five pounds to the bar
and your performance is still going up
and they're like huh like so why'd you
stop
oh i don't know use g-load every fourth
week like no no that's a very general
recommendation that may not apply to you
or your additions are just not hard
enough or the amount of volume you do
per week isn't challenging enough or
you're not going close to failure enough
you with your training design could have
gone for eight weeks and made fucking
the best gains of your life between
weeks
five and eight you would never know that
a lot of people will say i'm training
hard enough and i go okay have you ever
trained so hard
so consistently that your performance
plateaued and then even
declined or at least you stopped gaining
rep strength and they'll say
no well how the fuck you know you're
training hard enough a lot of the
research studies on this show
that the hard gainers the ones with more
slower twitch muscle fibers probably
they recover really fast and they have a
huge volume tolerance
and their minimum effective volume is
higher than most other people's and
their maximum recovery volume is way
higher
and they're down here in the shit
deloading every now and again never
getting up to the volumes that really
push the best growth
so if you've never run into your mrv
which is what that performance plateau
really is
you may be training under your mev or
mostly under your mvv the whole time and
thus you're getting shitty gains or no
gains at all
get some true failure at the end
that last week before you deload should
be like i did 10 reps
at five pounds less than this weight
last week and i'm doing five this time
or
seven and i'm like i couldn't do it i
couldn't match my performance from last
week
or at the very least you barely fucking
matched it and you're like there's no
way i can beat this next week at the
very least
if you're never challenged in training
train harder and trade fucking
longer more weeks and you may find that
the most productive training you've ever
done
is ahead difficulty wise of word or not
is that good news if you like to train
it is
if you realize that you need to train
more and harder to get the best gains
i like it because it's an objective
answer to a problem easy
if if i know this way will bring me
success i don't give a fuck fuck if
there's like razor wire and shit i'm
going through
but for those who aren't interested in
working hard this is bad news
if you're not interested in working hard
you just turn this fucking you should
have turned this video off a long time
ago
because all this shit requires work so
be ready to work and push yourself
occasionally
to your limits so that you know where
your limits are and it's never a
question of
you didn't work hard enough that's
really big to get out of the way
number 10 you might push and push and
push
and get so obsessed with pushing hard
that you miss a lot of the easier gains
at a lower volume level so every now and
again try to renorm your minimum
effective volumes
if you're starting from 10 sets a week
on average for chest
and you're going to round 20 which is
where your mrv is and you're deloading
that's cool every now and again every
few minutes
like every twice a year or something
what you can do is
try going down instead of starting at 10
sets try to really get your technique
super well
and try to train a little bit harder a
little closer to failure
but with like six sets per week and see
how six works and maybe
stay around six for a month and see if
you make really good progress and if you
do
it turns out that pushing the relative
effort the how close you are to
uh to failure is a little bit better for
you than just a lot of sub maximal
volume because there's
genetic variation there too some people
benefit from lower volume routines
that aren't as progressive in volume
don't add a ton of it and they just add
load more
and get closer to failure you may be one
of those people and you just be smashing
into mrv like waves against a rock all
the time for no fucking reason
or probably for a good reason but not
the best reason so you'd be getting good
gains like this
better gains if you did a lower volume
program and the only way you can try
that is to actually do them so if you
think to yourself man
i do at least 10 cents a chest i'm never
doing any less you're not going to lose
gains doing six
that's basically impossible at the worst
you're going to maintain
and look if you don't make any gains
between 6 and 10 sets per week
you can write that off as like fucking
didn't work fine but get in there
train heavy train hard close to failure
maybe closer than you used to
put a couple weeks together about the
same lower volume
see if it works if it works great then
you can eventually expand it and do more
or just stick to that lower volume and
get great gains
we just don't want you to be in a
situation where you're doing 40 sets a
week for chest and you think anything
less than 30 doesn't work
it could be that if you trained harder
your technique was better you trained
heavier and went closer to failure
sets of you know six seven eight nine
ten
get you as good of gains in sets of 30
40 or ever but like with i don't know a
third of the fatigue or some shit like
that
now lastly the biggest point of this
whole thing because it modifies every
single point before this
make all of these changes that we just
talked about all these changes
for months not weeks or days hypertrophy
muscle growth occurs over months in a
notable way and it is a process
that as researcher dr cody hahn who you
could look up
h-a-u-n i think has shown
that there are stages to hypertrophy
it's not like pouring sand onto a sand
pile and that's how your muscles get
bigger
it's more like building a skyscraper
there are layers of architecture and
some of it takes time
there may be a hypertrophy that sort of
builds a foundation and then later
hypertrophy that kind of fills it
in that shit doesn't take a day and a
half probably takes weeks
and it might even take months not just
to occur
but to notice so whatever changes you
make like if you start training with the
right exercises that have higher sfrs
don't just do that shit for a week and
be like nope didn't work my chest is the
same size no fucking shit nothing
changes in a week
but if you do that shit for three or
four months then you look at your chest
like holy shit my chest is bigger
this is awesome make sure to dedicate
yourself to the process do more of the
right shit less of the wrong shit
be patient wait it out eat plenty of
food and you'll probably break through
those plateaus
and if you can't break through a plateau
using this i don't know i'm out of ideas
guys see you next time where we talk
about breaking more plateaus of
different kinds
peace
you
