hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization with jared feather
also of renaissance periodization we're
gonna take you through the do's
and don'ts the mistakes and the fixes of
the close
grip barbell bench press the target
just so you're a member of the barbell
bench press is the triceps
but the pecs are a major target as well
almost always if you do this exercise
correctly
you get a ton of pec work a surprising
amount
so when you do program this exercise
please know that
and know that it's not something that
just isolates the triceps tons of other
exercises for that
this is a huge gnarly compound movement
that hits the triceps a lot and the
chest as well let's get into what's
wrong and what's right about how to do
this
the first mistake is a super common one
gyms across the world
grabbing the bar too close together
jared go ahead and
show us what that looks like folks grab
the bar really far inside their
shoulders
when they actually begin to press the
bar they can neither get a full stretch
in their triceps because the thing
bottoms out
or their their hands will touch their
chest that okay so you're not getting a
full stretch for the triceps and a lot
of times
the lockout doesn't work because it's a
super weird position so they end up
getting
to there it's super awkward go ahead and
rack but
the real problem here is first of all
the range of motion
is very very limited second of all
because there's a big balance issue when
you grab that close
your ability to produce a large degree
of force actually goes down
now truth be told if you grab really
close sometimes
the relative amount of tension relative
that goes to the triceps versus the
chest actually does elevate so there's a
plus side to this
the minus side is that you lose
stability and an ability to produce a
ton of force and recruit tons of motor
units in the triceps
and in the chest and it really doesn't
feel good on your wrists after a while
so it ends up having all these downsides
and you think well
it does train the triceps proportion a
little bit more to go closer
that's true but skull crushers do an
even better job of that
jm presses do a great job every kind of
tricep extension
when you do your isolations keep them
isolations when you do your compounds
align yourself to do them best to still
target the muscle
but in such a way that allows you to
produce a high degree of force
a ton of tension through the target
muscle safely for the joints in a stable
position
that's the key our recommendations on
the close grip bench
are to position yourself in such a way
that your hands
just barely come across your rib cage
the closer the better up until you can
no longer get your hands just
outside the ribs so jared's going to
demonstrate and he's going to go all the
way down
and touch and then come all the way up
notice his elbows are nice and
in we're going to demonstrate that tip
and mistake later now here's the thing
second problem we'll just take care of
right now
is going too wide people say okay i
can't be super narrow great point
how wide should i go there's a huge
temptation with close grip benching
to go just a little wider because you're
stronger there
but then it's a chest exercise so so
long as everything is comfortable your
shoulders
your wrists and everything feels good
including your elbows
you shouldn't go super wide you should
go as close as you can
given that comfort and ability to
produce force up until you either become
uncomfortable or becomes untenable to do
the movement
or your elbows get all the way flush to
your sides
and your wrists and your fists
descend just to the outsides of your
ribs anything a little wider is
okay if that's the only thing you can do
comfortably and you actually get a lot
of tricep activation that way
but anything wider arbitrarily after
that is just trying to use more weight
on the bar
the next mistake is to not do a full
range of motion a lot of folks like to
do pump reps in the mid-range
big problem with that the reason that
happens a lot is they grab too close and
they actually can't do a full range but
even for folks grabbing normally
sometimes they want to pump it out in
the middle range of motion unfortunately
that misses out on two
excellent things for the triceps first
of all there's a huge
stretch that occurs to the triceps at
the very bottom which is super growth
promoting if you go that low
second of all the lockout is a very
stimulative of the triceps
and that's the hard part for the triceps
to do a lot of times can you
get some easy reps going and do a lot of
reps in the mid-range yes
but you're essentially taking away
tension and difficulty from the muscles
you're targeting
power lifters the world over if you ask
them how do you work
triceps with close grip bench they say
okay it's all about that lockout like
they'll even do board presses
or rack presses where the lockout is the
whole point if you tell a power lift
your training triceps and you start
doing this with coast grip bench they're
gonna be what the hell are you doing
and they're completely right so even
though it's humbling even though you
might have to use less weight
every single rep in close grip bench
should do the following two things
number one
it should descend all the way down for a
deep stretch
notice how deeply his triceps are
stretched and then it should come
all the way up for a powerful willful
lockout now some people say
i can't get a good pump like that
because i get breaks take shorter breaks
you don't have to sit there for three
seconds
down and then up and then down and then
up and if you take a little rest break
at the top or bottom for a little bit
let your triceps cool off
you can actually keep going my rep style
and get that much more of a pump
and remember the pump's not the number
one thing in an exercise like this that
you do heavy compound
the number one thing is putting tension
through the target muscles which
means getting a very good stretch going
all the way down locking out all the way
for the full top position that's it
next mistake super common in a bunch of
exercises is not having a standard range
of motion for each single repetition
in order to count reps to essentially
give a certain stimulus that we want we
need
10 reps because last week we did
whatever nine and in order to track
progress to see if you're getting
stronger over time
you have to standardize your range of
motion that also has a huge benefit of
making sure you do the right range of
motion every time
so a lot of times what guys will do is
they'll do closer benches and they won't
touch the chest than every rep
but some rep they will and then
sometimes they luck out sometimes they
don't so jared throw us a bit of a
curveball here
yeah you know that was decent that was a
good rep and then
not really and then there's a couple
mid-range reps there and then sort of
your
training partner starts to tell you to
touch your chest again you start
touching your chest
but maybe you don't lock out and then
somebody says hey start locking out
and then you start really locking out
cool go ahead and react jared
and then and then the real question is
how many reps was that
i don't know like 9.3
who knows right every rep should look
very very similar
same range of motion great way to
practice that is to make sure
you touch your chest and pause for a
split second at the bottom lock out and
pause for a split second at the top can
you show us what that looks like real
quick
so every single rep is going to be
treated as its own
animal down and touch and up and lock
and down and touch and up and lock
that's it there is no cheating this
and you know if you're getting stronger
if you're adding reps or adding weight
over time
you know your muscles are getting bigger
because the range of motion isn't
changing
next mistake is to let the elbows flare
too much especially on the way down
we want the elbows to stay tight to the
body in order to activate the triceps
relatively more than they otherwise
would when you flare your elbows
you bring more chest activation to bear
which gives you more reps
congratulations but if you wanted more
reps of chest activity you would adjust
no normal grip bench
so sometimes people do what ends up
looking like this on the way down
and on the way up they end up just
letting their elbows flare a ton it's a
fine movement it's good
it's really like a different hand
position for the same forces
relatively as a normal bench what you
want to do is especially on the way down
tuck your elbows into the sides and then
come all the way up
if you want to untuck your elbows on the
way up to get more reps
that's probably okay right so you can
flare as you come up
but on the way down for sure keep those
elbows tucked for
maximum tricep involvement
next mistake super common is
uncontrolled eccentric you're
essentially dropping the bar on yourself
and then pushing it back up jared show
us what that looks like
so uh and then the up and then uh and
you get these pump reps going
here's the thing you can do more reps
like that because it's easier but we're
not here to make things easier we want
them harder
the eccentric control on the bar is
critical
now notice jared's eccentric phase can
take three seconds for example
or it can take just one second but he's
controlling the entire time
it doesn't matter which one you do
they're just variations good enough
it doesn't matter which ones you do
they're just variations both of them
work
but every time you have to stay in
control because
it's safer and you know just by a little
bit
and the big benefit is you're letting
the muscles work on the eccentric
descending phase
which is a big part of actually
providing the right amount of stimulus
your muscles grow from the concentric
phase
from an isometric phase when you pause
either at the top or bottom
and they grow from the eccentric phase
on the way down
you don't want to rob yourself of any
one of those so stop
thinking like i've got to get as many
reps as possible and if i drop i can do
more reps
you're not here to get as many reps as
possible you're sure to do a great job
stimulating the muscles
on top of that reps are counted as a way
to see progress don't chase the progress
too much just do the right thing
let the progress show itself
[Music]
if the purpose of the close grip bench
was to train your glutes we would do it
like this
yep get it jared oh yeah glute time
sweet but the purpose of the close grip
bench is actually to train your chest
and triceps
so don't move your hips body english and
wiggling and squirming and pushing with
your hips is really stupid
and it poisons your lift with the
fatigue
of all the other muscles you're using
that aren't supposed to be getting
fatigued
save your glutes for glute day and leg
day
and back day when you have to be in a
bent overall position leave them the
hell alone
when you're training chest and triceps
and just push with your upper body
power lifters might get a little bit out
of some hip drive even though their butt
is not allowed to leave the bench
as somebody growing muscle you want to
keep hip drive relatively minimum you
should have a solid foundation
let the upper body do the work don't
cheat yourself
nobody gives a how much you close
grip bench so if you're trying to
impress somebody else
including yourself moving your butt
you're just embarrassing yourself cut it
out
lower the weight if you have to strict
upper body only
for super heavy competitive bench
presses
power lifters will retract their
shoulder blades as much as possible
and they'll arch their backs as much as
possible
this allows them to stay safe with super
heavy weights
they'll limit the range of motion thus
not promoting optimal hypertrophy
and really put their chest into the
movement the thing is
some of those are no good for close grip
benching for close grip benching
we want to stay safe with the shoulders
but if you tuck your shoulders too far
away
you can no longer lock out without a
wide grip and then it becomes a chest
exercise
and if we lower the range of motion by
arching we're really kind of robbing
the deep stretch at the bottom of our
triceps so you want to keep a tight
position
but you don't want to do an excessive
arch and a huge retraction
just tuck your shoulder blades down a
little bit arch a little bit if you want
no big deal if you don't and do the
movement right jared set up
powerlifting style here let's see if you
can get a good back cramp going
you know some people when they do bench
press for hypertrophy close grip bench
they'll set up just like power lifters
you can lift more weight like this
and all of a sudden yeah that's a fine
looking close grip bench but notice his
triceps aren't getting a huge stretch at
the bottom
the elbow angle isn't that deep and
sometimes it's even kind of hard to lock
out
look notice he's not completely locking
out his elbows are soft because he can't
lock out through his chest
his shoulders are tucked back so far so
but if he relaxes
a little bit go ahead and show us the
right way so he's not going to arch as
much much less of an arch
he's not retracting his shoulder blades
nearly as much and all of a sudden he
gets a deeper elbow angle at the bottom
and can fully lock out
at the top that's the right way to do
close grip bench yes
you use less weight like that but the
benefit goes to the triceps into
actually growing you
the next mistake is thinking there's a
dogmatic way you have to lift technique
wise
in ignoring the stimulus to fatigue
ratio indices that we're taking away
stimulus to fatigue meaning are you
feeling the target muscles being
hit and disrupted and stimulated and on
the fatigue side
mostly are your connective tissues uh
able to actually tolerate the stuff
or are you having joint and connective
tissue pain or essentially sort of
pre-pain where it feels sort of awkward
if those things are happening you can
change your technique for example
let's say jared is trying to close grip
with this setup and
all the way down to the middle of his
chest middle of the normal place where
you press
and like his elbows feel a little funky
here his wrists don't feel that great
what maybe he can do is go to there so
go ahead and do a couple reps to the
lower part there jared
yep so instead of going to the middle of
the chest he's going to go to the
sternum and he may find
that he gets a great pump great amount
of tension in the triceps he might not
find that
he might try something else as pressing
to the nipple line so what he might do
is press all the way down the nipple and
it's a great stretch at the bottom for
the triceps right there
but not everyone's shoulders can handle
it so it's really a trade-off that only
the individual can make
and he might go a little bit closer with
his grip and find that that's much
better for his elbows so that he feels
in his triceps that much more
and or he might go a little bit wider in
his grip and actually figure out that a
little bit wider of what
most people close grip bench hits
everything like it's supposed to
perfect jared so the real kicker here
is start with a basic technique like
we're teaching in this video
but after that experiment with putting
the bar a little higher on chest
a little lower on your chest a little
wider a little narrower
tucking the elbows a ton versus letting
them get out just a little bit
you're going to find your own personal
technique that works best for you how do
you know it's working best for you
you feel your triceps and to some extent
your chest really
gnarly stimulation tons of tension
through it if you're doing high reps you
get a metabolite burning your triceps
you get a good pump from the exercise
and you feel after the workout like holy
crap my triceps are messed up
that's all good things and at the same
time you want to feel like your shoulder
joints elbow joints wrist joints and
everything
feel the best they possibly can given
the technique you're using
the last mistake in the close grip bench
is going either too heavy
or too light the good news here is there
really is no too heavy
for the close grip bench sets of 5 to 10
are awesome
because this is the exercise where you
hit your
fastest twitch tricep fibers amazingly
with a ton of tension through a full
range of motion with low repetitions
it's great in the 5 to 10 range for most
folks
what about the 10 to 20 range also great
for close
grip bench because the triceps get a
really good hit but
to be honest we have so many other
tricep exercises more isolation ones
jm presses skull crushers overhead
extensions every kind of cable push down
they're really good in the 10 to 20
range and we probably because we're
going to be doing most of our work in
that range anyway for triceps
we probably want to keep close grip out
of that just because we want to save it
for the heavy work and we have so many
other options in 10 to 20. so it's okay
in the 10 to 20 rep range
but maybe not ideal and then the 20 to
30 rep range our highest rep range for
hypertrophy
a lot of times theoretically it would
work for close grip bench what ends up
happening is your pecs get tired
or stimulated so much that they're the
limiting factor or your front delts so
it ends up being that
ideally yeah 20 to 30 reps would work
but other muscles tire out first
it doesn't let your triceps take a huge
hit and if you're doing a lot of close
grips
with 20 to 30 reps it's okay even if
your triceps get a big hit but there are
so many
other cable exercises dumbbell exercises
for triceps that can do that
so much better without all the added
systemic fatigue
to your pecs because making your pecs do
20 30 reps is a lot you could be saving
your packs
for the great work that they can have
with heavier weights or lighter weights
on their own training sessions so
ideally close grip benches should be in
the 5 to 10 rep range for most folks
maybe up to about sets of 15 or totally
cool 10 to 20 especially 15 to 20 reps
usually would save for other exercises
and sets of 20 to 30 usually not great
for close grip benches and for sure
better for other exercises because the
pecs
and the shoulders tend to be limiting
factors folks
that's it for close grip bench tips use
them wisely and remember that stimulus
to fatigue ratio
how much are you hitting your target
muscles versus how
not awesome your joints are feeling
you've got to find the best combination
of techniques
it's going to take some time feel free
to experiment there are different bars
like the
football bar where you can grab neutral
that's a great option you can even do
close grip dumbbell presses
machine presses and all that good stuff
almost all these tips even for close
grip incline
are really virtually identical use them
well if you have questions
shoot them into the comments hopefully
somebody that knows will answer
help each other out and if you want more
videos on these technique breakdowns
throw some exercises in there at the
bottom for us we're always looking to do
more videos because quite honestly
i've got nowhere else to be i have no
friends i have nowhere to go nobody
talks to me thanks for tuning in
[Music]
hey guys dr mike here with jared feather
whatever ifp pro bodybuilder we're here
to do a russian style
close grip bench you're ready
