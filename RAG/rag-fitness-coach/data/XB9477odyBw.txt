time under tension is widely held to be
a fundamental muscle building principle
it's simply how long your set lasts
it's commonly said extending your time
under tension can convert additional
muscle hypertrophy
where some also suggesting 30 to 60
seconds is the optimal time under
tension range for maxing hypertrophy
in this video we'll examine the
scientific evidence supporting time
under tension but we'll also examine the
scientific rebuttals to this
we'll try and establish whether minimum
and maximum time under tension
thresholds exist and whether there could
be any benefit to only slowing down the
lowering phase of an exercise let's dive
in
[Music]
muscle hypertrophy is a result of
myofibrillar protein synthesis the
creation of the proteins that make our
muscles bigger
exceeding the rate of myofibrillar
protein breakdown the destruction of
those same proteins
a study out of canada by birds and
colleagues indicates a longer time under
tension increases myofibrillar protein
synthesis more
they established when training three
sets on the leg extension with a thirty
percent one rep max load
increases in myofibrillar protein
synthesis 24 to 30 hours post training
were greater after using a 6 second
lifting and 6 second lowering tempo
versus a 1 second lifting and 1 second
lowering tempo
of course
time under tension per set were
substantially more with a 6 second
lifting and lowering tempo
three studies out of japan find
long-term muscle growth is enhanced with
slower repetition speeds that prolong
time under tension
for example one of the studies by water
navy and colleagues had untrained men
perform three sets on the leg extension
and le curl
quadriceps and hamstrings growth was
superior after training with a 3 second
lifting and 3 second lowering tempo
compared to using a 1 second lifting and
1 second lowering tempo
furthermore a recent study out of brazil
established when equating time under
tension between two different rep tempos
muscle growth ends up being similar
one group performs sets of 12 reps with
each rep lasting three seconds in
duration while a second group performed
sets of six reps with each rep lasting
six seconds
time under tension per set were 36
seconds for both groups
growth of the chest and triceps was
similar between both groups
so
the data overviewed so far collectively
suggest time under tension may be
integral for muscle hypertrophy
but
they have notable limitations
with the brazil study that equated time
under tension between two different rep
tempos
their results cannot truly suggest time
under tension is integral as no
comparisons with other time under
tension durations were made
a 36 second time under tension was the
only duration utilized in this paper
with the canadian bird and quality study
finding greater my fibular protein
synthesis with a longer time under
tension
they did not equate proximity to failure
the six second lifting and lowering
condition involved performing
repetitions to failure the one second
lifting and lowering condition did not
perform repetitions anywhere close to
failure they simply matched the number
of reps performed by the six second
lifting and lowering condition
similarly the three studies out of japan
finding greater hypertrophy with slower
rep tempos that create longer time under
tensions also did not equate proximity
to failure
as an illustration of this we noted
water navy and colleagues found greater
cord and hamstrings growth after
training with a 3 second lifting and
lowering tempo versus a 1 second lifting
and lowering tempo
however both of these conditions involve
performing three sets of eight reps with
a fifty percent one rep max load on the
leg extension and leg curl
with these training variables using the
three second lifting and lowering tempo
is going to induce much greater fatigue
and get you closer to muscular failure
versus utilizing a one second lifting
and lowering tempo
all of this begs the question
what happens when we get subjects that
perform reps to or close to failure does
a longer time under tension or a time
under tension in the 30 to 60 second
range
still end up producing more hypertrophy
the answer is no
a study out of brazil by lasso rada and
colleagues had subjects trained the
unilateral leg extension for three to
four sets of repetitions to failure with
a fifty to sixty percent one rep max
load
leg one trained with a one second
lifting and one second lowering tempo
while leg two trained with a three
second lowering and three second lifting
tempo
this produced different time under
tension values and leg one involved a
couple of sets performed below the 30
second threshold that sometimes proposed
to be essential for gains
yet
growth of the rectus femoris and vastus
lateralis ended up being similar between
legs one and two
another study out of brazil by chavez
and colleagues echoes these findings
subjects trained the unilateral leg
extension for three sets of reps to
failure with a 70 or one rep max load
some subjects trained one leg with a two
second lifting and two second lowering
tempo while their other leg used a
self-selected tempo that ended up
involving an average 0.9 second lifting
and 0.9 second lowering tempo
time under tension would have been
greater for the two second lifting and
lowering leg yet gains in vastus
lateralis sides were similar between
both legs
we also have a 2016 meta analysis by
schoenfeld and colleagues which combined
the findings of four other studies and
established when reps were performed to
or close to failure
individual rep tempos from the range of
0.5 to 8 seconds were comparably
effective for evoking muscle growth
if we need even more evidence the
research on heavy vs light loads
provides this
numerous studies now indicate so long as
reps are performed to or close to
failure loads between 30 and 80 percent
of one rep max are similarly effective
for muscle hypertrophy
with thirty percent one rep max loads
individuals very generally tend to
perform up to thirty to forty reps
while with a heavier eighty percent or
one rep max load individuals very
generally tend to perform between 7 to
12 reps
thus the time under tension would be
much greater with loads on the lighter
side of the spectrum
yet they do not evoke any more
hypertrophy than heavier loads
matter of fact
some research indicates loads heavier
than eighty percent or warner and max
may also be able to evoke substantial
hypertrophy
but most of these studies did have
subjects at extra sets when training
with heavier than eighty percent of one
red max loads
for example schoenfeld and colleagues
compared seven sets of three reps per
exercise to three sets of 10 reps per
exercise
both conditions involved reps in close
proximity to failure and hypertrophy
ended up being similar between both
groups
the author of this study noted in an
instagram post the seven sets of three
reps group attained around a measly nine
seconds of time under tension per set
presumably the time and detention in the
groups of the other studies performing
five or fewer reps would have been
similar
thus
we have some evidence indicating time
under tension values as low as 9 seconds
can still be substantially effective for
hypertrophy provided overall training
volume is sufficient
[Music]
it's clear to see a wide range of time
under tension values are comparable for
evoking muscle hypertrophy but there
likely exist min and max thresholds
as just alluded to we have some evidence
indicating time under tension values as
low as 9 seconds can still be
substantially effective for hypertrophy
provided overall training volume is
sufficient but what about max thresholds
firstly we know endurance exercise such
as running cycling or swimming for very
long distances involve extreme amounts
of time under tension yet they produce
minimal muscle hypertrophy
but in a more traditional lifting weight
scenario a study by shawnka and
colleagues provides a potential insight
previously untrained women trained the
leg press squat and leg extension each
for three sets a session
a normal group trained with 80 to 85
percent of one rep max loads using a one
to two second lifting and one to two
second lowering tempo
while a super slow group trained with a
forty to sixty percent warner max
loading
using a 10 second lifting and four
second lowering tempo
the researchers noted both groups
trained in close proximity to failure
but slow twitch and fast twitch fiber
growth from the vastus lateralis muscle
ended up being greater for the normal
group based on some calculations the
super slow group likely attained a time
under tension per set between 84 and 140
seconds
so somewhere around here could be the
max time under tension threshold for
optimal gains
but we undoubtedly still need more
research to evaluate this
[Music]
what about exclusively slowing and
prolonging time under tension in the
lowering eccentric phase of an exercise
unfortunately the research is unclear
and conflicting in this area
two studies have found with a preacher
curl and using a one second lifting
tempo using a 4 second lowering tempo
tended to be better for biceps gains
versus using a 1 second lowering tempo
a limitation is the differences in both
these studies were not statistically
significant
indicating it's not clear if the
differences between groups reflect a
true difference or are just the result
of random variation between groups
a study out of japan found with a back
squat and using a two second lifting
tempo thigh size gains were similar
between using a 2 second lowering and 4
second lowering tempo
another study out of brazil found with
leg extensions and using a 1 second
lifting tempo
rectus femoris and vastus lateralis
gains were similar between using a 2
second low ring and 4 second lowering
tempo
but vastus medialis gains were greater
for the 4 second lowering versus 2
second lowering tempo
muddying things even further
a study out of the usa found with leg
extensions and using a one second
lifting tempo
gains in anterior thigh at one region
were similar between using a one second
lowering and two second lowering tempo
but gains at another region of the
anterior thigh were actually greater for
the faster one second lowering tempo
all in all more research is needed to
elucidate the effects of manipulating
the lowering phase
[Music]
duration so long as you're performing
reps to or close to failure a wide range
of time under tension values are
similarly effective for muscle
hypertrophy
provided overall training volume is
sufficient
time under tension values as low as 9
seconds can be viable for evoking
significant muscle growth
while a time under tension beyond 84
seconds might be sub optimal for gains
finally more research is needed to
evaluate if there's any benefit to
slowing the lowering phase of an
exercise exclusively as the current data
in this area is unclear and conflicting
