oh it's good to be back again dr james
doctor mike weekly webinar mike how's it
going
i am surviving very good that's all you
can expect these days
you know the times and all 2020.
within this economy i know you know what
uh eddie van halen died i saw today
i was just like man 2020 sucks
this year blows folks fun fact i'm
hosting mike's sister's family so sonia
and her husband phil and their two
adorable children are over so
i'm hanging out with the extended
israetel family it's so great
they're out here in montana we're having
a grand old time
damn yeah pretty fun all right
so sonia might come in here and and uh
webinar bomb us it's somewhere
live she knows well
phil knows sonia i'm not sure you gotta
remind her not to say stupid shit
okay as she walks in you gotta be like
hey this is recording the cloud
i got the door closed so hopefully
that's enough deterrence
um okay well i'm gonna pull up the old
youtube so i got so much crap on him but
here we go
all right okey dokey
so let's have a go i always save it when
my face is on like a stupid frame you
see this
so our first guy up is a with a actually
that's it
and it's one day ago a minus
a minus is that it yeah i think oh yeah
all right got it he says constant
tension legit or bro science
bodybuilders have been talking about a
few years
and i'm wondering whether there's merit
to it by constant tension i mean number
one not locking out to keep tension on
the muscle and or two
not only the muscle being a passive
stretch like not letting your biceps
rest at the bottom of curling
also what about people cutting squat
round to keep tension on the quads
so i'll start this off the constant
tension thing
um it's a perennially
debated thing uh
you sort of want two things to happen
during a set
one is you want to accomplish a certain
amount of mechanical work
two you want to reach a certain
proximity to failure
both of which are important so what you
can do
is bias these in one direction or
another and get not the greatest results
so if you
decide that you want to get all the
mechanical tension you can
but going close to failure really feels
bad which it does
then you what you can do is you can
do a set of ten in the curl by curling
and then resting
for a second or two and then curling and
then resting and then curling and
resting
if you had done most of your curl sets
before
with relatively constant tension such a
set of 10
is going to be really a whole lot of
reps in reserve and while you do
accomplish the mechanical work and write
your little handy dandy training
notebook
that you did a set of 10 really you
didn't challenge the fastest twitch
motor units
nor to juice you get a lot of metabolite
sequestration
nor did you get a really good pump
because you didn't really push the
muscle to its limits because you gave it
so many breaks
so in order to not give the muscle an
excessive number of breaks
what you don't want to do is start with
more constant tension
and over the course of your mesocycle
progress
towards more and more breaks not a good
idea
however whatever tension
you have whatever degree of constant
tension or rest breaks you have imposed
if they're similar at the beginning of a
mesocyclone
accurately judging rir there adding reps
and adding load
and keeping the same amount of rest
roughly
means you are actually reducing your
reps in reserve
training is getting harder and is always
appropriately hard and no worries
this can be done with continuous
constant tension so for example you
unwrap the leg press you don't
completely lock out
you pause just briefly at the bottom
maybe not even pause you just
gentle touch at the bottom and when you
get almost a failure you rack
that's totally fine then your sets for
that
rest of that meso should all look like
that and you have a really accurate
gauge
as to your rir or
you can do anything between that and the
most extreme which is doing one rep
locking out at the top resting for a
second doing a rep
pausing at the bottom blocking out at
the top resting for a second but if you
started like that
let's say you got 25 reps those last
five are going to be
fucked up super fucking hard and you
will be at a high a low rir and then
next week you got to get 26 or you got
to do 10 more pounds and it's going to
be just as hard as long as it's roughly
the same
what i like to do in many of my sets not
everything is conducive to this
is do kind of a mirep's thing where
especially with like leg training with a
leg press
uh jared and i will do a set of roughly
10 10 to 12
and that's going to be in relatively
constant tension style or just brief
lockouts
then we rest for two or three seconds at
the top
and allow especially our fastest twitch
motor units because remember the slower
twitch motor units they don't really
need the rest they recover really
quickly
but the fastest twitch motor units do
need the racks and about two or three
seconds later we do another mini set of
all around five reps
jewelry through seconds rest again we do
another main set of two to three reps
but we should do two
to four of those within a single
quote-unquote set
which means that three sets of leg press
later we've approached failure and
backed away
nine total times three in each one which
isn't the equivalent of nine working
sets but it sure as hell isn't
three so it's more like six so the
the the relationship there the cool
advantage there is like once you're
locked in psychologically you're ready
to do a hard set you got in the leg
press you set up your feet
you might as well just fucking go ham
and if you can take the rest policies or
the maya reps
it's at the very least a time saving
strategy and it's an easy way to get all
that hypertrophy
what you don't want to do is fuck with a
constant attention relationship
to the brakes and needlessly fuck
yourself over
by purposefully resting so long
that the set gets easier to do the same
amount of tension
which means that if you really fuck up a
set you can do constant tension in week
one and get 10 total reps
but then if you do rest breaks in week
two you had better get like 15 fucking
total reps which is to say the end of
the set should be
just as low of an rr as long as that's
the case
then constant tension works well uh and
brakes work
also well but you've got to basically
keep them similar weeks to week so that
you know you're pushing yourself
as hard and you know the tension and the
metabolites and etc is scaling
in a very small predictable packets not
different every single time
yeah very good answer i think the uh the
the constant tension as we see with the
kind of the bodybuilding scene
uh i think is one of those like
well-intentioned things for the wrong
reason a lot of the times
where it's good in in many ways which is
it gives you like a better mind muscle
connection because you can really focus
on
hitting the movement that your the
muscles that you're trying to hit within
the movement itself which is really
a very positive thing yeah then the
burning sensation you get is a little
bit exaggerated so
what if this is not to be confused with
occlusion training but just muscle
contraction itself occludes the muscle
and sometimes when you go through the
full range of motion
you get those little little teeny breaks
where it just allows a little bit of
those metabolites to kind of leak out
and so when you do the kind of constant
tension
like we'll say 90 rom like we're cutting
off a little bit at the top and the
bottom you just get an exaggerated like
pump and burn effect
just because you're doing that so in
that sense it's a good idea because
you're like okay i'm trying to do
something where i feel it in the muscle
it's burning i'm getting like a crazy
pump and i can like really mind muscle
connection so all those things are good
um sometimes it just becomes like
needlessly difficult
of a technique to maintain track or just
be consistent with
i find i still think that full range of
motion is generally the better strategy
however i think for advanced
uh bodybuilders who might be dabbling a
little bit more in crazy frequencies
here's a really simple example um if you
want to train your triceps more
you can start exploring doing some of
the more
i don't think i wish i had a better way
of phrasing it this is pissing me off i
don't want to like fall into saying
constant tension but you could use more
partial range of motions
in your chest pressing because they
might overlap too much with your tricep
training because you're trying to train
triceps
a little bit more frequently because you
just can't cram all your tricep work
into
one session that would be an example
where i'd say okay that's a good
justification
for it but if you're just doing that for
its own sake i think it's silly if
you don't need to do it because you
don't need more tricep training
then i think it's silly it looks like
mike wanted to chime in on that one
james can you tell my sister that those
sounds are inadmissible on broadcast
sorry uh they're
the bathroom is right here and i think
that they're doing bathroom time so
yeah sorry suffering child sounds
um okay yeah i think we beat that one to
death um just just to make sure we
answer the whole thing
um let's see and like sorry
on that same question the squats is a
good example where if you try and cut
off a little bit of the range of motion
you'll feel your quads burning burning
burning a little bit more and some
people have like if you ever watch
chad wesley smith do squats for higher
reps and buy higher i mean like more
than five
um he'll do more of a just like a
constant like tempo
style and it's just easier for him to do
it that way and it's just a personal
preference
i would personally like for me i
wouldn't do it that way just because it
doesn't feel good for me because i feel
like i'm just gonna crap out right away
and then it becomes like a
a weird bouncy thing am i like doing it
right am i being consistent with my
technique am i doing my breathers the
same way i always do my breathers and
that breaks the momentum and it just
becomes like a weird silly thing so it's
one of those i think like you hear us
mike and i say this
on a variety of topics week to week if
you do it that way
keep doing it that way if you don't do
it that way don't add it in
kind of out of nowhere yeah and just to
be very clear
if we're saying that locking out
and get letting the muscle be in a
passive stretch like bicep stretches at
the bottom and curling makes the
movement sufficiently
not difficult by letting the muscle rest
we're also saying
it allows the muscle to rest to do more
reps
so as long as you're honest about your
rir so for example someone could say you
i get a better pump if i
do um middle of the range of motion well
yeah but you only get 10 reps let's say
if you do full range of motion and you
just did 10 reps with the same weight
you wouldn't get as good of a pump
that's less to do with the range of
motion and more to do with the fact that
your rir is now five instead of one
if you actually took the time to rest
you know at the bottom a little bit and
rest at the top a little bit
and you truly pushed it close to failure
your pump would be unreal
and i ask anyone uh you know uh
to to try this at home tell me
what gives you a better quad pump in the
leg press you leg pressing
for a set of straight set of 10 with no
break and racking and then seeing a
minute
later how big your pump is or with the
same weight
doing rest pause uh and and resting two
or three times between mini sets
for two or three seconds at a time and
getting 18 reps
it's not even close the 18 rep pump is
gonna fucking just destroy you and also
if we're saying we're not going to go
all the way down and all the way up
we're missing motor unit activation
there that is important
so on the one hand skull pressures
they're in the middle of the range of
motion can give you a pretty good pump
for the number of reps that you do
but they miss that on the lockout effect
which is a big part of what the triceps
do and they're certainly motor units
that are much more active and you don't
want to miss out on the stretch so in
the squat
if you don't go all the way down and
stretch especially with hold if your
quad's already pumped from multiple sets
of leg presses and or squats
and you do squats with a mini pause at
the bottom to really stretch the quads
under tension while they're pumped
it fucks you up in ways the constant
tension never ever ever could
and most of the people that do constant
attention to be completely honest are
just trying to avoid that they're
avoiding the work
they're avoiding the pain nine times out
of ten people say constant attention is
because they want a better workout but
really it's because they want to just
just just cap out earlier oh i'm close
to failure i have to stop
shut the fuck up go all the way up and
down take a rest break or two in your
sets you're going to be in for a world
war
hurt and more anabolism it just sucks
and constant tension is just one big
excuse for the most part
and you and you can use more weight that
way so you can tap you know pat yourself
on the back for
squatting 405 i very much agree
um hey mike real quick i turned the game
down on my microphone how's my sound
right now i'm
trying to eliminate some of the
background flying to me sounds okay okay
i'm trying to just uh
the game like the more the gain is up
the more it just picks up
all right next up is eruption 89
sexual eruption that's an interesting
name eruption 89 has
let us clue in on what he's saying he is
saying
it sounds like he ruptured in the year
1989 where the fuck is this guy
it's right below a minus oh god damn it
what
um i think we have a different sort oh
it's
above there we go got it
he says it's my birthday today and my
girlfriend
bought me a mug that reveals a picture
of dr mike posing when it's filled with
hot water when did
when did we start selling those how did
i miss it yeah you can just get one of
those with any picture you choose
um first of all that's hilarious
second of all i don't believe that you
have a girlfriend so
thank you for buying that mug take that
eruption burn eruption
um all right on a serious note my
question
colin uh you said that it's okay to
continue doing sets with a weight so
long as your reps don't drop below five
and only drop the weight if the reps
fall below five
however if we were trying to have a
specific proportion of our exercises in
the 10 to 20 20 30 rep range just for
fatigue reasons
uh would it better protocol for fatigue
reasons to be to drop the weight as soon
as we left the target rep range
otherwise lots of 10 to 20 rep range
exercises that drop below 10 reps
after a couple of sets we'll be accruing
5 to 10 rep range level fatigue they
won't be
because 5 to 10 range uh five to ten rep
range level of fatigue is only a proxy
to the load used
only five to ten rep range fresh weights
can give you five to ten rep range
fatigue
okay if you're you know like if you're
so pretty exhausted in your back that
you're doing sets of five to ten at a
deadlift with fifty percent of your max
gee you know those aren't that the sets
aren't that hard and hilariously enough
it's actually
the argument for what you're saying
works for that sometimes
uh we we say that fundamentally anything
about five is hypertrophic but
fundamentally doesn't mean equivalently
if you're using lat pull downs to try to
drive a lot of volume for your
intermediate and slow twitch fibers
and you're trying to get a big pump once
you get below like 10 reps
yeah the tension's accruing and it's
fine it's a fine set it could probably
be better if you just drop the weight
and still hit sets of like 15 or
whatever
so for that reason maybe sometimes we
can follow the advice of still staying
in the rep range
so it's kind of a two-factor analysis
it's actually quite simple
first big rule that's not really ever
broken if it's not five if it's less
than five reps don't do it right then
for sure reduce load
second rule is if your stimulus to
fatigue ratio for whatever it is you
want to target
is higher in an arbitrarily higher rep
range than five
then just stick to that and make all the
load adjustments
yeah really good advice um so this would
be something like more like what i would
use with an intermediate where i was
saying
i would say like okay once you fall out
of that rep range we could potentially
do down sets and there's some x like
mike said i think the lat pulldown was
like the perfect example of that where
it's like if you're doing less than 10
reps it's like
you could probably tolerate more sets
but at that rep range it's just not that
productive um
from like late intermediates to advanced
i think what would be a better strategy
and this
this is my opinion so just take it for
what it is it's my opinion
once you kind of fall out of your rep
range whatever it is
assuming that you started maybe midway
and then work worked your way out
what i would generally do for myself or
other people is
uh just move on to a new exercise for
that muscle group at that point
so if you were doing 10 to 20 you did
like 15 13 12
you know 10 or maybe you drop below and
you like you know 15
12 10 9 or something like that that's
fine and good
maybe move on to a new exercise for the
same muscle group that you were just
working and
you can go from there you don't have to
do that that's just my opinion it's just
something that tends to work well
it's a nice way of auto regulating how
well you are doing within an exercise
given
a constricted amount of sets which we
usually say is roughly five
ish per exercise and just in it
as an anecdote i'm not saying this is
the way that you should do it but in my
experience that's really tends
to work really well for me and for a lot
of other more advanced lifters where
it just doesn't seem to benefit you
doing like you know eight sets of the
same exercise once you
are a late intermediate or an advanced
person it's probably better to have a
little bit more intersession variation
and that's a good way of kind of
checking that so you don't have to span
the entire range you don't have to start
at 20 and work your way down
but once you kind of get out of the
range that you're working in instead of
doing a downsets maybe move on to a new
exercise
next up majid markul right to below
eruption 89.
we have a different sort going oh i
found it got it oh it's a long one
it's not as long as it looks oh there's
only the top parts really question
uh he says hi doctors in the last year i
saw a couple of videos
uploaded by jeff nipper jeremy oh shit
he had two
questions
there it is the tldr one yep
this one yep oh
where were you looking
mine's sort of the piece i just didn't
see that question in this one
eye doctors in the last year i saw a
couple of videos sorry i'm stupid
don't worry got it good to go good to go
my bad
uh by jeff nipper jeremy ethier and greg
ducette which explain how it's possible
to lose fat and gain muscle
while in a small caloric deficit 0.5 to
1
body weight loss each week that is not a
small caloric deficit
that is a meaningful large calorie
productive okay one percent a week is
fucking super high
and point five is moderate so okay
they said this is possible if you're
eating enough protein four to five
meals a day you're training hard enough
at least two times across the group per
week and there's progressive overload
and three if you're either beginner
obesity trained or anabolic steroids or
sub
optimized trainee oh sorry this is
killing me
this is no fault of your own uh
uh but this is something that we've been
saying for years just put it in a
slightly different way this is like
when you are new to diet or new to
reasonably good evidence-based training
can you recomp
yes this is like so you know
or if you know anabolic steroids all
these things right like so if you're a
noob
to either diet or exercise can you gain
muscle and lose fat at the same time yes
this is
unanimous almost unanimous within the
evidence-based community
those who consider themselves an
immediate advancement in reality have
not been trained any properly
in addition to that greg recently
released a video where he compares
cutting slash bulking with
main gaining i like maintaining better
gain tainting is better
gaintaining is way better see below for
a quick summary of what he said if
you've forgotten or have not seen the
video if
you just assume i've never seen any of
gregory said's videos it's probably for
the past
um in short greg recommends to first
slowly cut
that's not
um using the principles above until you
reach your desired body fat percent
looks good i knew after that you
maintain what's fast at that point
eat it yeah eat at maintenance calories
you will gain muscle but keep the same
fat mass
for the rest of your life until you
reach genetic potential for muscle
growth yeah it's just bad advice it's
just wrong
oh man that's terrible yeah i mean like
so
that's absolutely it not only does it
violate like all the diet stuff which is
kind of the
more pressing issue but even from a
training perspective that doesn't work
you can't just train indefinitely
at maintenance and just continue to gain
muscle that just won't happen you'll
you'll
hit plateaus you're lean that's okay so
i'll put this way
almost no bodybuilder has ever done this
if you look at bodybuilders in their off
season they're significantly
larger and a little bit fatter sometimes
a lot a bit fatter
and almost all of them will tell you
that that's kind of just what it takes
to gain muscle size
the hypercaloric condition consuming
more calories than you take in
is incredibly potent at every single
level
to the production of new muscle now
you can gain muscle to a more limited
extent especially in those
specific circumstances at maintenance
which means you're losing fat and
gaining muscle at the same time
but uh imagine someone would say you
know you can get as lean as you want to
by not going into a deficit
you'd be like well that would require me
to build muscle as fast as i lose fat
well it's the same fucking thing
it's literally the same thing as saying
you can gain muscle
it just what does it say eating did it
say eating at a slight surplus
um after that you may gain at
maintenance calories you will gain
muscle but keep the same fat for the
rest of your life
so if you're actually at maintenance
calories you can't gain any body weight
that's just
right so it's just it's just wrong
completely wrong um now the the light at
the end of the tunnel here is that folks
like eric helms for example will say
that you don't have to gain as quickly
as some other people say and that's
absolutely the case like you can gain
a quarter of a pound a month and still
make really good gains over the long
term there are good arguments for that
uh but if you're gaining zero pounds per
month which is what maintenance calories
literally means then you don't gain any
muscle
up until the you've gained enough muscle
to counterbalance the fat look
like if you're at 10 fat and you have
amazing genetics you might be able to
gain muscle over the course of several
years
and maintain to get to eight percent fat
motherfucker you ain't gaining any more
muscle to get to six five four three
percent fat
and it just doesn't happen and and and
second of all
you would still be 160 pounds at all
that shit so
i in graduate set has been over 200
pounds many times in his life of course
he ate at a fucking surplus
so his advice didn't work for him like
greg just said it's a
an interesting guy's funny guy on
youtube not a repository of wisdom
unfortunately a bunch of the stuff he
says make
goddamn sense yeah you know not to not
to dismiss our question ask her here
majid um but my friend this is just
just total nonsense yeah so so this the
key here is just just throw that in the
trash
yeah so it says he says my questions
number one what are your thoughts on
slowly cutting i mean gaining compared
to cycling between bulky and cutting
phase especially for natural and
immediate lifters so simply want to have
good physiques
for competing recovery yes so it doesn't
work as well
it works fine but you will just look mad
and you'll never be
jacked uh compared to what you could
have been and then number two from the
examples greg mentioned
main gaining indirectly implies that you
can actually gain muscle in a
maintenance while keeping almost the
same mass of fat
in other words you are gaining weight in
a maintenance diet if you are a beginner
oh
wait hold up no no no imagine i just
figured it out he goes when you're
supposed to stay the same weight but
doesn't that violate the laws of
thermodynamics
yes yes you are right yes
it's a oh it's only for beginners it
does not apply to anyone
intermediate or above yeah sorry folks
all right ah that one to death so
anyway always great advice from coach
greg our favorite
our favorite doctor whatever the hell he
says train harder than
last time oh he's a he's a gem
all right let's see not so focused
uh who's up next we got
a little handy-dandy thing kj should be
right below there james unless we're
working off
we're looking at a different thing so i
have to do a little bit
kj
[Music]
i don't find oh got it all right
if you want to learn skills like doing
more pistol squats becoming better at
ring dips and other more stabilizing
movements that you don't
fall on perceived
that you don't fail on a perceived
muscle then how do you implement that on
top of your bodybuilding routine
do you add this to your volume or
partially replace it with it because you
have to partially replace it because it
still taxes the muscle
easiest question we'll answer all day
james
yes so the fundamental answer there is
very very simple now the key with
learning new skills
and i'm very excited to say that i've
been sending off copies of my
draft of the book that i've been working
on to some people for some feedback so
that's moving along and it
tackles this issue quite a bit what we
find is that learning new skills
is largely a matter of increasing your
exposure to those skills
in very very small doses and tailing
excuse me tailoring
the intensity to your individual needs
so kind of making it as hard as it can
be
given your um abilities and kind of
slightly pushing you a little bit harder
so you can kind of be in that flow state
of challenging intensity
the problem with that model is that it
doesn't meld with hypertrophy training
all that well because there's too much
overlapping exposures
comparatively with your overload
training of the muscle groups that
you're training per week so for example
pistol squats
you could you would benefit massively
from spending
five to ten minutes working on pistol
squats
anywhere between two to five times per
week and that would be a massive massive
improvement in your technique
however that would also be a huge pain
in your ass
literally in this case if you are
training legs
anywhere between two or three times per
week depending on your you know size and
training age and all that stuff
so in that case the fatigue from like a
squat session
would directly impede your learning
ability in any of those technique
sessions
so it's a definite difficult thing to
juggle because
motor learning is directly inhibited by
fatigue and your ability to express
things like technique is inhibited by
fatigue
consolidating motor memory inhibited by
fatigue you name it
it conflicts on many levels so generally
you want to anytime that you're trying
to work on those new skills you want to
be in a pretty
fresh state of preparedness and you want
to basically keep them
short and increase your exposures per
week so you don't want to spend an
hour practicing ring dips it's the idea
here you want to spend like five or ten
minutes practicing ring dips
and then doing that multiple times per
week rather than crushing yourself on a
bench day and then crushing yourself on
a ring dips day and then crushing
yourself on your incline bench day and
then
repeating that process over and over
again so keep the exposures
small uh and frequent
boom next up
is nickels i saw nickels earlier
ah got it
all right is there any benefits using
circumin
other adaptogens or sedatives during
deloads or post-workout to get baseline
fitness quicker and reduce cortisol
what uh about to drop diet fatigue
instead of doing long-winded maintenance
phases
uh two-thirds to 1.5 are preceding fat
loss phase so
just real quick what human being
right so human probably does a whole lot
of nothing adaptogens is not a real
scientifically verified thing it's just
a term some folks made up
uh to try to sell supplements and
unfortunately that's like evolutions
yeah um sedatives are really powerful
drugs you shouldn't take without a
doctor's prescription and it's by no
means clear that they reduce fatigue
overall more than just relaxing watching
tv
uh so no i'd have to say it i wouldn't
invest in such a strategy
uh absolutely not um so the sedatives
like might facilitate
recovery activities but it doesn't
actually promote recovery in any
any different way like mike said from
just doing a good job uh on your own
lifestyle stuff this is one of those
things and nichols i'm not trying to i'm
not trying to
bag on you here too much but this is one
of those questions which basically says
what's the magic pill that lets me
circumvent like x y and z thing that i
don't want to do
um and the reality is is like all those
things are stupid
don't don't don't waste your time with
those what you should be focusing on
is doing a good job with your training
doing a good job with your nutrition
and a good job with like your lifestyle
your sleep hygiene your stress
management all that stuff
that's going to go a bajillion times
further than trying to find some quick
fix supplement that's gonna
do deeply dick and you're not wrong for
asking that this is like a very common
theme that we get all the time but just
keep that in mind this is like a
prototypical question like
hey what's this magic supplement well
it's nothing it's just snake oil
all right what was that last question
say what what was the last thing he was
asking is that a separate question or
just
was that i have no idea he was you're
going to use these things to drop
fatigue
faster uh to drop diet fatigue which is
awesome
oh rather than doing like a maintenance
phase ah
i see yeah no well there's also the
problem that you have with like
metabolic adaptations which sometimes
are just
a time series event which just takes a
little bit of time to fix which uh you
know something like a sedative has
nothing to do with
uh all right pico rodriguez
right below nichols in my book
this might be one where if i find it
within i sorted by
top top whatever oh trippy
and i removed that thing that milo told
me to get because we were doing the same
for a while
you know uh if i don't find it within
like five seconds i'm just gonna have
you do the screen share so we're not
wasting time
and oh somebody's name is mv
very funny i like it all right i can't
find it so mike why don't you go ahead
and screen share
yes hope you don't have any porno i
usually do
all right
ego rodriguez can you see it yep
martin burkhan has changed his rpt
routine to doing as many sets of five as
possible with 9rm
never to failure terminate sequence what
less
what what
when the last set leaves you with one
wrap in the tank stop early then too
late
is this a good strategy for adding size
to be honest it's fine
it's fine for a workout um
what is it achieving for those who don't
understand programming nothing
is this junk volume it might be there's
really no way to tell
but uh it's an interesting but seemingly
quite random autoregulatory strategy
so um you know for many people it would
result in a pretty decent stimulus
but i would say there are more logical
ways to program and it
sounds like martin burkhan would try
some shit like that but i bet he's real
confident this is the ultimate way to
train because he usually does
why nine rm why why not that seems like
a strange we just don't know math james
i i don't know shit yeah it's it's
um so so right off the bat i mean you
can evaluate it for yourself right so
you're always doing sets that are
roughly four from fail
you know um
does that seem like a good way of doing
progressive overload right off the top
probably not
yeah it's fine so it goes from four to
fail to one to fail so so okay to be a
little
technical it is a strategy to regulate
intra-session volume it's not really
clear that
intra-session volume is regulated in any
meaningful way with results your volume
landmarks
like starting in a four rar and ending
at one rir for some people that would be
perfect for some it wouldn't be enough
volume because they fatigue really fast
and for other people it would be like an
infinite amount of volume that really
fucking
just sucks it is you know slower twitch
people would be able to
create that longer they probably have
you know more tolerance for within
session volume
if you had somebody who was like mid
range or lower
in terms of five yeah you would just do
infinity sets of sub max fives and you
never grow 100 everybody's
wildly inefficient strategy for someone
really really big and strong
that could be a thing that could and
then also like
it just it leaves out all the other rep
ranges and all the other failure
practically it's just
it's uh can i can i can i put a little
dick vibe out there
sure and i don't mean i'm gonna put my
dick on the camera here but
uh congratulations you figured out that
doing
anything above five reps sucks you know
what i mean it's like
fuck off get out of here with that shit
yes doing sets of 10
sucks doing 10 sets of 15 sucks
right like you think this is like some
magic way of like not having to
do the things that are hard again this
is just one of those like it's kind of
similar to the other question
it's like is there a way i can
circumvent doing the things that work
that are hard with doing things that are
easy like yeah you can try but it seems
like a big fucking waste of time
and i'm not trying to shit on anybody
the question asker or the the reference
point here but it's just one of those
things like mike and i have seen this
a thousand times i feel like i'm turning
into dr stone the more
or older i get it's like now i've seen
this
that's but that's the reality is like um
you see this package
so many different ways so many different
times in so many different contexts
where it's like
yes doing sets of five feels good
because it's
easy and you get to lift a relatively
heavy amount of weight right but what we
found is that yeah it's maybe not the
best for hypertrophy and if you want to
get
probably the best hypertrophy results
you're probably going to be doing
somewhere between 5 and 10 10 to 20 20
to 30 kind of cycle throughout the year
and guess what sometimes it fucking
sucks
sometimes you're out of breath and
you're tired and you're exhausted shut
the fuck up
like if this is what you signed up for
right if you want to just be like a fake
power lifter and do sets of five sub max
all the time
be my guest it also depends on how long
you rest if you rest long enough
your workout could last damn here
forever so yeah so i'm not trying to
yell
uh i don't remember who asked that
question it was it nickels or somebody
else um
it was uh what's his name goddammit um
pico rodriguez pico and i'm not trying
to i'm not conveying my anger at you
it's just one of these things where like
uh
like i said mike and i have seen the
same idea where it's like
here's here's the easy way to get the
same results it's like no it's just the
easy way and get to get the easy answers
that's a really good idea
all right darren hawkins is up next
you want me to throw him on the screen
again james please
[Music]
darren hawkins says
keena this is amazing james you're going
to die i've had i'm having a rough one
tonight this is a rough one for james
nobody said that's already bad
it gets worse if you're a fighter you
should focus on getting
a 315 pound overhead press what
as you would destroy your opponent your
punches would be extremely dangerous and
explosive
no one who is equally skilled would come
close to your performance
unless they took you down or whatever um
do you agree
and how could you achieve that
apparently james has a lot of experience
with fighters no it doesn't but um
oh my god this is like blowing my mind
no he fucking doesn't i don't know maybe
he does
uh and uh sports specific stuff i'm not
sure what sport he played is this a
worthy goal
so i i just will answer this for real
and then we'll let james
tear it to shreds so first of all as a
fighter
one of her priorities should be getting
as strong as possible in the pushing
musculature which can include the
overhead press
as strong as possible because the
stronger you are in the overhead press
and incline
bench and the flat bench and other
related movements the more force you can
impart to your opponent the less your
fist slows down when it hits their head
and their ribs and then the more damage
you can
um you know elicit and plus you can win
more so
so in i'll tell you the only golden gem
you get out of this is being stronger is
always better
now in order to focus on getting a 350
pound overhead press out so
i tell you this kinobite does not have a
350 pound overhead press
he or likely never will um cocky
statement i have a 300 pound overhead
press
uh 350 pound overhead press but it's
been so long trying to get one
uh that uh i don't know how to box so
you know like there's only so much so so
fighters should spend most of their time
on the technical tactical and
uh in endurance of uh training around
fighting
and then some of their time some should
be spoke
focused on trying to get a whole body
strength a small fraction of that should
be in overhead
press strength but that whole idea of
retooling your entire training
to try to get a 315 overhead press such
as jon jones
biomechanically will never overhead
press 315 um
uh almost maybe if you really gassed him
up
uh the polish hammer might be able to do
that after three or four years of
training but that would be three or four
years of training where you fuck his
fight training in the ass
to get out of basically trying to do the
journey i don't think francis and ganu
who has the
the highest recorded punching force ever
recorded
could do a 315 pound overhead press so
what does that tell you so yeah i mean
like i don't know if you
how exactly you know the guy said that i
think maybe he's including like
push presses jerks maybe kind of
clumping those the grain of truth is
like yeah you want to get fucking strong
as a fighter
the 315 is the focus is like nothing
that
like if you a fighter you can overhead
press 315 why not go for four or five at
that point it's a very arbitrary number
so yeah great answer so uh uh uh my
outrage was not at you darren hawkins
this is actually a very legitimate
question
and i'm glad you asked it and the the
reality here is this right
what we have found in the literature on
in all sports and this would include
combat sports
um it seems that getting stronger always
seems to pay
very large dividends now the conflict
arises where you have to
do a cost benefit analysis of saying
every increment of strength that you
gain is going to cost you time
effort recoverability focus training
just limited resources
right and so at some point those gains
start slowing down
normal as a as all people with their
training age goes up their gains will
start going down
so you have to ask yourself like okay
let's use a less ridiculous example
because the 315 overhead press i think
mike and i have already illustrated that
that's a pretty absurd
example but let's just say you think
that your athlete needs to bench press
275 pounds and right now they can bench
press
250 pounds and that's like the best that
they have done in a
really long time and you feel good about
it
but gaining 25 pounds on the bench press
when you're also doing mma training jiu
jitsu training
kickboxing training all these other
things right and like
two to you know 250 was like a huge
milestone after years and years of
training
what amount of effort is it going to
take you to add 25 pounds to your bench
press a
fuck load where is that effort going to
come from it's going to come at the
expense
of everything else that's important for
you in your sport
so the way that i like to frame it and
the way that i'm framing it in the
upcoming book
is using what we call normative
standards where we say
for somebody competing at some sport in
some position
at some level there are standards or at
least rough standards
of all the people in that competitive
group in terms of strength power speed
cardio skills tactics all the above what
we are generally looking at is where
does my athletes
fall within the spectrum of people that
they're competing against their peer
group right so they're competing at some
level at some
weight class in this case you know and
so how much do they bench how much do
they squat how high do they jump
and then we usually kind of look to see
is my athlete within about one to two
standard deviations of that average and
if they are
far off basically right so they're kind
of within the noise of the average right
and what that would basically indicate
to us as a sports scientist
uh sports scientists would say they're
competitive
if they're within kind of one to two
standard deviations meaning they're not
particularly strong or
weak they're just right where they're
probably supposed to be
and so at that point we could make a
case and say you know what
this is probably okay so we'll just use
the pressing strength as an example
say you know their pressing strength is
roughly where it should be it's within
one or two standard deviations of their
peer group
is there anything else that needs to be
looked at and we might look at their
skills and we might say
we might talk to their bjj coaches or
their kickboxing or their mma specific
coaches and they might say
dude this guy sucks ass against the
fence
he has no takedown defense he's got no
clinch defense he always gets turned
push down single leg taken down
and you say wow okay so based on the
coaches feedback we've identified that
this is a particular skill and tactics
set that is below
average based on the coaches and the
coaches on it and we can say you know
what we don't need to spend a ton of
time
trying to get my overhead pressing
strength from a competitive level to an
above competitive level which would be
two standard deviations
or more above the average these are
holes in your other parties when you
have other things that are worth your
time and so
people are exploiting and winning
against you exactly
so again like mike and i will oh
i think i don't want to speak for mike
but i feel like i know you well enough
where i think if the question is should
i be stronger
our heart would always say yes
but the sports scientist in up here
would say
is there anything else that's causing
you to lose more or win
you know or not win as many as much as
you could and that's probably where we
should point our focus i think
so getting back to the original question
315 overhead press ridiculous there's no
norm
no one in mma or combat sports can do
that i've seen dr mike press
300 for like one or two and this was
like years ago i mean years ago so i'm
sure you're way stronger than that now
uh and that was a monumental feat you're
trying to tell me that somebody like a
fucking
israel artasanya is gonna overhead press
315 but i can't overhead
out of here are you crazy that's an
absurd he might not be able to overhead
press 135
like you just i don't think he could
split jerk after three years of training
315 pounds you know what i'm saying it's
just
it's a lot of weight i couldn't do that
no marios puzzinowski probably can
uh oh i don't know if in his current
shape he can even in his fighting shape
i don't know if he could uh a strict
press 315
i didn't want to go there probably but
the other thing with the overhead
process is specific we've already said
this is a ridiculous example
done it's done right but just to add on
to how ridiculous it is
the thing with the overhead press is you
have to have a lot of just ballast in
size
there's no way around it if you don't
weigh like over 250 pounds that's never
gonna happen
period right from for the average person
um
so at that point not only do you have a
strength issue but you have a size
ballast issue where
not only do you have to be strong but
you have to be big just to be able to
counterbalance that much weight over
your head and be stable
and then again it's a cost benefit
analysis you say how much time do i have
to spend getting big enough to be strong
enough to do this other thing when i
could just be training for mma
when i have a pretty comparable excuse
me comparable
i'm too worked up comparable amount of
strength power and fitness
characteristics when i should be
focusing on the things that are
causing me to lose a lot like not
checking kicks not being able to defend
takedowns not being able to defend
submission attempts
those are things that you could be
spending your time and effort up
[Music]
next up screen share is oh i'm certain
sorry oh i'm sorry
nope i did it instinctively but you
should do it
is alejandro mayofret
he says or asks rather when people
recommend a number of hours of sleeping
per day or that command to be
consecutive throughout throughout the
night
or can you sleep uh a nap in order to
reach enough time for the day i guess
the answer is really the sleeping phases
but i don't really know
thank you for your attention docs james
knock it out
when the the recommendations are meant
to be interpreted as a sleep
opportunity meaning you don't have to
necessarily sleep eight hours
continuously
you just had eight hours worth of
opportunity to sleep
and that's expected to be somewhat
intermittent
but um the problem would be right if you
only gave yourself
five hours of sleep opportunity that's
when you're gonna start to run into like
chronic problems so when it's under
the opportunity recommendations meaning
maybe you only actually slept for five
hours then you kind of laid around for
three hours that's
that's okay that's factored into that
recommendation if you only give yourself
five hours of sleep opportunity and that
means you got maybe
three hours of sleep and two hours of
tossing and turning
that's less good excuse me
ideally you want as long of a contiguous
interval as possible spreading it out is
not as good but still better than just
getting less than the total
absolutely all right next up
is earth savior farn
captain planet earth savior yeah he says
very good question what should we do if
a machine in the gym is out of order
using during a mesocycle for example i
programmed hack squad so i was making
great progress and fill in a lot of the
quads
however not both hack squad and leg
press my second choice is out of order
oh
man would it be best to introduce
something like a smith machine squad or
should i play it safe with a leg
extension i feel the issue is more
pressing as i'm currently going through
a cut
great question easy answer you want to
pick an exercise that replicates the
biomechanics and muscle targeting as
much as possible
you just do your best which literally
means like in that case yeah smith
machine feed forward squat is the next
best thing probably
and then just do that and start with a
little bit lower rir
start with a little bit lower load to
feel it out same rep range which means
totally different weights but same wrap
range
and then and then just fucking crank it
and then after a while the other
machines will free up no big deal and by
the way this exact same answer
if you're traveling and you have like a
routine that you're trying to hit and
it's like all like james and i travel
all the time
we used to before covered we will again
after uh and we go to a bunch of
different gyms in the uk australia
ireland etc we show up to a gym
we find the machines or implements that
closely most closely
um uh estimate uh or approximate what it
is we need biomechanically
and then we select a weight while
warming up that is going to get us in
the target rep range and we fucking go
to whatever rer we need to boom that's
it and
honestly like if you train literally
like that all the time where you never
use the same machine
one week in a row like you only lose
like 10 of your max gain potential which
is to say like
the amount of protein synthesis uh in
every workout is 90
of what it would be or something like
it's fucking great workout
you can fucking grow grow grow tons of
bodybuilders chant this all the time and
they grow to be the biggest in the world
so
it's a small it's a small matter and i
will say
if you're start getting on the smith
machine squat and you do it two or three
sessions in a row
it starts to feel really good the sfr is
really good and the leg press and hack
squat are fixed
and they're ready don't just go right
back to them stay with that
smith machine if you forward squat while
the going is good and then go back to
those other machines later
yeah great answer and then just i wanted
to tackle that last part about playing
it safe with the leg extensions like
motherfucker
your first choice was hex squats like
you weren't playing it safe to start why
are you gonna play it safe now just keep
just keep going for it the thing is like
uh you can make a uh
you could say like oh well hack squats
was like my easier day and then like my
harder day was
you know high bar squats or something
like that so my double dipping too much
yeah i could see that a little bit sure
but you don't have to go
way conservative and be like okay no
axial loading just just knee extensions
like
that is okay and especially like if you
are a high responder to leg extensions
and that's great
if you're like a met or lower responder
to leg extensions
yeah you're just trying to avoid doing
the harder stuff again right and that's
a natural natural response to that
situation we've all done it we've all
been there
mike and i tried like he said we
traveled and you you show up and you're
like
oh they don't have like uh you know this
this particular bench setup machine fly
or something yeah let's do machine flies
they only have cables or dumbbells
right yeah and you're just like uh well
i guess i don't know i don't want to go
too
hard and you're like just fucking get in
there find the closest thing
yeah yeah do it all right last question
for the day
is oh man bye
oop i don't have an aneurysm god
get up giggles
[Music]
he says how would you how would
programming vary for men's physique
competitor
when compared to a classic physique or
bodybuilding computer a really really
good question
so the basics are here men's physique
don't train legs
uh you might train your calves because
they are visible it's probably a good
idea actually because cavs bring a lot
of really cool symmetry to the body up
down symmetry
um but your legs i would train either
minimally or not at all probably not at
all if you're really serious
and you're going to want to prioritize
the muscles that they're really looking
for so you want to train a little
fuck out of your arms and your shoulders
upper chest and upper back
things like erector thickness like many
more pull-ups than rose for example for
a physique athlete much more inclined
pressing than anything else
you're going to want to train your abs
because you're going to want them to
poke out and pop out all sexy
alike and all that stuff and probably
for really good balance you might want
to train your forearms significantly too
to get an overall bigger looking arm
and you want to train your delts a ton
and another one you might actually not
want to train traps hardly at all and
that goes easy because you're not dead
lifting anymore and that's definitely
another thing and you're not rowing
so easy problem but if i find a way to
train your side delts without a ton of
trap involvement
then maybe if your traps are really
prone to growing you would do that
for classic physique you train them a
lot like an open bodybuilding competitor
but you prioritize training the calves
the forearms
and the delts especially because those
three muscles when they're big
give you a fucking statuesque classic
look
so just you basically just want to look
as much like jared feather as possible
right um there's never no classic
physique guys ever had
way too big of shoulders too big of
forearms or too big of calves in
addition to that you want
really big arms you want a really big
chest especially upper chest and again a
little bit of that men's physique thing
where
the back thickness for classic guys not
so important
um leg size you would train legs but you
wouldn't kill legs
legs would be like you know they're good
they're decent looking good you're not
going to try to get the world's biggest
glutes or hamstrings or something like
that because it's just not something
they judge a whole lot
open bodybuilding you fucking guns guns
blazing branch warren style max
everything out
james that's yeah you you crushed it i
got nothing that was awesome
yeah so that's you know people say like
oh classic physique or men's physique
the training is more pansy-like well
once you remove a shitload of leg work
and a shitload of rowing
yeah it's easier it's just easier
training but it's a cool look and i got
tons of respect
we both have tons of respect for those
guys the other day all we do is
arbitrary anyway it's all for fun
and these are the guys looking fucking
like statues like fucking word up you
know
um it's it's fucking sweet that there's
people that do that and
you know i think people get like i used
to be like this i stopped
a while ago um you judge people for like
the gym is some kind of manhood test and
you're like you don't train lives you
suck like
what the fuck are we supposed to be
training like training legs is fun it's
really rewarding but if it's not your
thing
who gives a shit like yeah it's like
saying like like really you don't eat
hot dogs
you're fucking pussy right like it sucks
it's so funny because i know a bunch of
fighters that don't train legs you're
going to call them them a pussy you know
what i mean like
you're probably not not to their face
anyway so it's good when training
is uh goal specific to try to look uh
feel a certain way that you like
and not ego specific to try to like
justify your existence and if that's
what training is to you
look welcome to the club just maybe
don't judge other people by it
i know it's a random offshoot but a lot
of times the physique guys get flack for
being pussies or whatever
it's like well look if the reason you
train physique is because in your heart
of hearts you want to be a bodybuilder
but you're too big of a pussy to train
legs
accurate but it's probably not the case
you just want to look fucking sweet look
like a superhero you know like
who would also want to look like captain
america yeah totally and it's just
different strokes for different folks
like don't impose like your value set on
someone else like they just they don't
share the same values that you do so you
getting all pissed off about it's not
gonna help you or them so
just back the fuck off
boom all right is that it for this week
that's it for this week we had some good
ones on there we always do but i thought
those were some definitely some
interesting ones
um let's see what's coming up uh i'm
i recorded another episode of jamestown
sports really it was more of a quick one
um just to get i'm trying to get back
into the routine so i wanna i just had
to like
shoot one off get one going uh daniel
hacker was the winner this week i
focused on a kind of a training age
related to tennis question we didn't get
into too much tennis specific stuff
but it was kind of i thought an
interesting question that comes up a lot
in sports so
that should be coming up soon dr mike
you got any cool interesting videos
coming out or anything
fun oh i'm sure
guys i don't want to make too big of a
deal of this but
scott our video guy and i we record
videos considerably in advance because
we're trying to build a buffer of like
an infinite number of videos to release
metro
we only release like three or four
videos a week i'm not going to tell you
how many record a week but it's more
than that
um so right now
these uh work i'm doing on scoping up
future videos and making power points
for them is so far ahead of the videos
that we've released
that unless i have a stroke and can't
speak or something i can pretty much
promise you
uh really really high quality content
with multiple series addressing various
problems and i've
training strength training nutrition and
stuff like that for the next three years
and then we're adding videos to that all
the time so
we have videos coming every week you can
uh
guaranteed three videos at least on rv
strength
in depth super detail it's coming it's
coming
in addition to that we're releasing all
the rp plus stuff slowly on youtube
um so one tip actually check the
playlists
independently of just the videos that
come out because some of the more boring
playlists of the entire courses we have
in rp plus
our video guide just uploads them
straight up and he doesn't there's no
notification
so check the playlists especially the
recently added ones you're going to find
entire courses
you didn't even know existed currently
on the rp youtube so
give it a look that's really cool one
last one to add is that we're going to
be doing
an audiobook version of how much should
i train and we're going to do a bit of a
hybrid where
we're going to do the normal audiobook
stuff and then we're also going to be
tackling just like
dr mike and dr james kind of bullshit
insights that we've kind of
accumulated over the years after we
introduced them
and then yeah we'll do like a fact kind
of thing too and i've already compiled a
lot of fun topics and
and frequently asked questions but if
there are anything kind of
any fact type questions that you guys
would like to see answered in the
audiobook version coming up
go ahead and drop them into the comments
and i'll try and pick them out and put
