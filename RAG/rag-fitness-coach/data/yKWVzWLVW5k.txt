you'll find a million and one different
methods given in all these grow taller
videos on youtube
but those are the only three real
legitimate ways to increase your
vertical height
what's up guys sean now the wani
realscienceathletics.com with a
different video topic today i've
actually had this one written down
on my list of possible topics to cover
for like
over five years now but i just never
went ahead with it because i wasn't sure
if it made sense to
uh post a video like this but a lot of
people have asked me about this subject
over the years because it is somewhat
related to building muscle and losing
fat
you know people are trying to improve
their body composition and their
appearance
and so it would make sense that height
would play into that as well and there
are a ton of these videos on youtube
with
millions and millions of views between
them increase height grow taller
2.7 million views how to increase height
naturally
3.7 million views i stretched for 30
days to grow taller
it works 2.4 million views seven
stretches to grow taller 6.9 million
views 10 home exercises to become taller
in no time
25 million views so clearly this is
something that a lot of people are
looking up
and if you read the comment sections on
most of these videos you'll see that a
pretty high percentage of people
genuinely aren't sure whether or not
this stuff has any merit so
that is the question for today is there
anything that you can do to increase
your height naturally or is this just a
bunch of bs
don't forget to subscribe and turn on
notifications if you're new here and
let's jump
into it so there are a variety of
different factors involved in how your
body physically grows taller
but the primary way is through the
lengthening of the long bones so in the
lower body that's going to be
your femurs which are your thigh bones
and then your tibia and your fibula
which are the lower leg bones and then
at the end of those bones you have what
are called epiphyseal plates
also called growth plates and as you go
from childhood into puberty
those growth plates build new cartilage
at the end of the bones and then that
solidifies into actual bone
and then once puberty is finished the
growth plates fuse together and you're
not going to grow any taller
after that point obviously the spine
elongates too that's done through a
slightly different but
similar mechanism and then of course
throughout puberty uh the other bones on
your body
increase in size as well but when it all
comes down to it assuming you grew up
receiving
proper nutrition um you had reasonable
sleeping habits and you weren't living
in a chronically high stress environment
your final height is mostly going to be
a product of genetics the biggest growth
spurt for males usually happens between
the ages of 12 to 15
and usually by age 18 you're going to
have reached your maximum height
now there are always going to be
exceptions you know in some cases there
could be some growth into the early 20s
but
usually by the late teens you're pretty
much done
environmental factors contribute to a
certain smaller degree
but genetics are what's going to make up
the vast majority of it
and unfortunately genetics are not
something that is within your control
you know it would be great if we could
do things to build on our height in the
same way that we can build muscle or
lose fat or gain strength you know if
that was possible i would have been on
that
a long time ago um i'm basically average
height myself but you know if i could be
six foot three i would definitely take
that option but unfortunately it just
doesn't work that way
you know sorry to be the bearer of bad
news here but all the stuff that you see
online
grow taller programs you know
supplements stretching exercises
magical ayurvedic height increasing
foods
it's really just a bunch of bs put out
by people who either don't know what
they're talking about
or they do know what they're talking
about but they're just doing it for
views or they're actively trying to scam
you
by selling you their height increasing
products yeah you're going to find some
videos of people who claim that
you know they stretched for 30 days and
they added three centimeters to their
height or whatever
and it might sound convincing but either
these people aren't measuring themselves
accurately you know all it takes is
a slight change in how you measure
yourself to get a different reading
especially when
you're trying to do it on your own or
they're standing with different posture
and they just don't realize it
or again they're just knowingly
exaggerating things for views and
for profit yes believe it or not i know
this is absolutely shocking and it could
uh rock your entire reality but the fact
is that sometimes people do in fact make
things up and post them online for
their own game what's going on guys uh
it's crazy i know
and uh if you don't believe me then go
ahead and try this stuff out okay devote
your time and effort to some height
increasing program for a few months
get yourself measured properly before
and after and you can confirm for
yourself that this doesn't actually work
assuming you're past puberty and you're
not just experiencing some normal growth
throughout that time
now if doing any of those things uh you
know stretches or certain exercises or
whatever
if that helps you improve your posture
or just causes you to become more
mindful of your posture
then that can help you appear slightly
taller but it's not physically
elongating your body to any significant
degree
now it is true that your height
naturally decreases slightly throughout
the day because when you stand up
the fluid sacs in between your spinal
discs they can press a bit
because of gravity and so certain
stretches might be able to very slightly
reverse that compression
on a temporary basis but the effect is
really going to be extremely small when
it all comes down to okay probably not
even noticeable
and it won't last very long anyway so i
would say that it's just not a very good
use of your time
the only truly legitimate treatments for
increasing height would be
certain types of hormone therapy for
those who are still going through
puberty and who have certain health
conditions
or there is actually such a thing as
height increasing surgery and that's
where
holes are physically drilled into the
leg bones the bones are broken and then
a metal rod with screws gets inserted
and then that rod gets slowly uh
lengthened over time and some people can
gain up to as much as five inches in
height
using that procedure but it's generally
considered to be a fairly risky surgery
there are a lot of potential
complications that can arise from it and
it's apparently a really long and really
grueling process from start to finish so
it's just not going to be realistic for
most people
and then aside from hormone therapy and
surgery
um if you are younger um you're in your
let's say earlier to mid teens and
you're still going through puberty then
again covering the basics like
proper balanced nutrition good high
quality sleep mitigating stress
those things are going to ensure that
your growth potential is 100
maximized i mean in case you were
wondering uh no there is no evidence at
all to suggest that weight training
stunts growth in any way so that's not
something that you need to worry about
you'll find a million and one different
methods given in all these grow taller
videos on youtube
but those are the only three real
legitimate ways to increase your
vertical height
and unfortunately the first two won't
apply in virtually all cases
and the last one is only going to play a
smaller role and it's probably not going
to be a limiting factor for most people
um in let's say developed countries so
with all that established if you are on
the shorter side and it is an insecurity
for you
the whole mindset aspect of things aside
okay that's a whole other
topic beyond the scope of this video but
just in a direct
practical sense okay standard advice but
you've got to recognize that height is
not something within your control
and you've just got to focus on
maximizing the aspects of your
appearance that you do have
control over and there are quite a few
things that you can optimize
um you can gain muscle and lose fat of
course to give yourself a stronger more
dominant look
um if you want to get a free program for
that then you can head over to
shawnell.comcustom just follow the form
there and i'll send you back a free
individualized
training and nutrition plan that you can
follow based on your current condition
and your personal physique goals the
link for that is up here
as well as down below in the description
box um aside from that you can
dress well with properly fitted clothing
there's your hair style
obviously perfect hygiene is a given
carry yourself with good upright posture
take good care of your skin
and then some guys will give themselves
a small boost by wearing thicker soled
shoes
or even using insoles to gain an extra
inch or two in height now that's kind of
a gray area
it wouldn't be my thing personally but
it is an option depending on your own
personal
sort of viewpoint and approach to things
so maximize all areas as best you can
but bottom line as far as actual
physical height is concerned
you can stretch until you're blue in the
face or eat as many pounds of
bamboo as you want or buy whatever scam
supplements some random youtubers trying
to throw at you
but it's really just a waste of your
time effort and your money and that is
time
effort and money that you could be using
toward things that you actually do have
control over and that actually will
improve your appearance for real
