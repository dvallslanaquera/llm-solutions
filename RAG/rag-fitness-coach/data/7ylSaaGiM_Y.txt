there it is i was ready for it this time
folks it's q a
dr james and dr mike mike how's it going
good good how are you
you know i had one of those day ruining
moments today and
i think you'll relate to this i was
taking a shower
and i had that like i need to poo moment
where i was like
i'm in the shower and i have two choices
right the first
choice is get out of the shower you're
soaking wet you're just gonna make a
huge mess
take that poo and god forbid it's not
like a nice clean poo
and you actually have to like really get
in there and then your butt cheeks are
all wet and the toilet paper is
resolving it's just
a disaster option two is just be a
 savage and just in the
shower and hope for the best
by the way let's go the same way anyway
exactly and i did that
in our on our wedding weekend in tahoe i
literally
it was more of a shart i didn't i didn't
intend to do it
but debris went past my feet either way
so i did it
uh so yeah i had that moment and i i did
the first option i got out and just made
a mess and just
you know then like my day is ruined at
that point there's no recovering from
mid mid mid shower poop
there are worse poops james that there's
like mid pants poop where you poop your
pants
the shower poop is kind of a
self-solving problem because i mean
you're in a shower already
you can get all squeaky clean yeah just
just bend over and spread them and just
let it
it's like a black box process you walk
into the shower dirty
you come out clean it doesn't really
matter what happened while you're in
there you come out the same way
yeah you know i i made a mistake i had
some of that kashi cereal and then mel
has been making
uh like the low carb tortilla
quesadillas and i think it was just like
i hit my my fiber mrv for that for the
day and then it then it
manifested today when i was in the
shower just like oh no
so you know how like
to get the big kraken monster to come
out um
aquaman has like the magic like
trident and he like activates it
yes i'm pretty sure you could also get
the kraken to come out if you just like
throw a box akashi goleen into that
 cage like
it's like there we go look at it
you're like that's not ink
[Laughter]
oh god so anyways sports q a questions
sports questions
all right here we go you ready yeah
where the
 am i there we go okay all right
first man up is a gentleman that goes by
only two letters
l space w that's kind of like gw
maybe he was a president that's right
all right he says hello docs how
important is basic structure of massing
maintaining and cutting for an immediate
lifter
what is your recommended approach to the
principle of phase potentiation on a
block to block scale for a lifter at
this level of advancement that is
interested to maximize the results in
terms of hypertrophy
i understand that face potentiation is
one of the least important principles of
hypertrophy
and then as an immediate lifter uh
probably be able to make excellent gains
without
it directly implementing the plan
however i'm a person obsessed with doing
everything possible to achieve my body
composition goals you just answered your
own question lw
if you're obsessed you got to do face
initiation uh but like sorry continuing
on
like i assume most people that watch
these are therefore
i don't know maybe some definitely um
a lot of people commenting like this is
too complicated you shut up and lift
i don't think those people are obsessed
with anything and like a lot of people
are just more
willing to make trade-offs they're like
i'm not trying to be the best and i have
a family or whatever so
right i don't want that because i can't
an addiction to alcohol no
no talking about that you can't judge
that one
like i actually have neither one of
those that's kind of sad
um the therefore i wonder if it would be
better
to be conservative using maintenance
phases where sensitization active rest
and many cuts in order to get longer
undisrupted massing phases
with good momentum or use it more often
like an advanced athlete would
so i'm just going to start answering
this here and there and james if you uh
need to
um to uh to tag in tag in
and then of course you get the last word
anyway um you only need to
you only only use resensitization phases
and many cuts when they're needed
the problem isn't that face potentiation
over applied to an intermediate athlete
waste time
the problem is face tension or
potentiation over applied means you're
doing something but you don't
have to do it here's a perfect example
someone could say
yeah man i need three weeks of active
rest and we could ask him like geez
that's that's
that's really insane you really need
three weeks to really take it easy with
that you know i'm like no after about
three or four days i'm good to go for
another year but
why the are you doing three fact
rest right another one is mini cut like
of guys are like abs and veins like i
think it's time for mini cuts like mini
cut to wear the show
like what the is wrong with you
just keep gaining so if you need
a mini cut if you need active space you
use it the thing is intermediates just
won't need them as frequently
that's the only thing it's not using
them or not using them it's how
frequently do you use them that that's
really the only thing and how long do
they go like
you should plan a six week mini cut but
after three weeks you're pretty
goddamn shredded
stop stop that it's not it's not the
thing
it's how much of the thing uh you know
it's it's like you know
do what's the difference between a race
car driver and a person who goes to the
grocery store in their car it's not that
one has a car and one does not
it is that one uses his car in a very
different way for not nearly as long and
pushes it not nearly as much limit both
use the car
same idea um james anything on that
particular thing
uh yeah so similar to dr mike's answer
just in a slightly different direction
you know the
when we generally call someone an
intermediate it's because
they have transitioned to a state where
they just can't kind of do the same
things that they
had been doing as a beginner and that
can manifest in a variety of ways
and so in this case like if you if you
fancy yourself an intermediate
usually that means that face
potentiation structure
is more necessary than it was before
whereas a beginner
you might not need to have like um
a whole lot of different phasic nature
in your training you can kind of get
away with just doing a lot of basic
things
relatively infrequently and make great
great gains so
as a beginner you know you can lift
three or four times a week and not
really do a ton of variation in
exercise selections reps intensities and
volumes and you'll make great gains
but what you'll notice as your training
age goes up is that you actually need to
start varying those things in a logical
way
hence that's why that's one of the ways
in which you become an intermediate and
that
you're not you're no longer making gains
doing what you were doing before and
your training has to become
incrementally more complicated and this
is one of the ways it does
yes so we don't want you to have a level
of complexity if it's not indicated
right it's like someone has like a
 go-kart and
the fastest they can take it on any of
their little trails that they
ride around their
around their uh montana residence
perhaps
is you know 40 miles an hour and someone
says hey should i get a go-kart like
supercharged with spoilers so you go 120
miles an hour it's like
to do what with it you're like well i
guess nothing it's like why are you
doing that right
if you go car can go 40 miles an hour
around curves but it only goes 20 then
yeah it's a good idea to
to get the upgrade so things have to be
justifiable no don't do anything just
as a matter of course and then okay so
lw continues
as an example i myself have around three
months cycle massing block using that
perfect templates and implemented a
two-week mini cut in order to
re-sensitize
a bit of lower body fat i'm now in the
second mass motorcycle after the mini
cup the first mile cycle
after the mini cut i was able to have a
way longer accumulation phase than
predicted
eight weeks i'd plan to do a three month
cycle mass block but that would put me
at the very upper end of the recommended
length for mass
would i benefit from room
resensitization phase after a mini cup
and mouth cycle 2 then proceed massing
should i wait until my cycle 3.
here's the thing how fatigued are you
how fatigued are you and how beat up are
you and how psychologically fatigued are
you
do you need to be sensitized
re-sensitization is one of those things
like
like so right now i'm actually the
perfect example for this right now as i
am and always
perfect um i am so beat to i'm at
the end of like
i did some half half recovery half weeks
instead of full deloads
i'm on week number eight of my massing
mesocycle
right i don't even know which way is up
anymore i'm modifying my workout
severely in order to just
careen across the finish line somehow so
if you ask me like hey do you need an
active rest i'm like yes for the love of
 god i wish it was here a week
sooner but due to scheduling concerns it
can't be
so i'm like just praying to god i
survived this whole goddamn thing but if
you ask me like
if i was intermediate or beginner it'd
be like genius rest face it'd be like uh
what's that and you describe it you're
like no i feel gold and i feel a
thousand percent
if you're hitting prs if you're not
super psychologically fatigued if your
desire to train is high
just keep going the only
exception is if you have like a
bodybuilding show coming up or a meat
and you have to really proactively make
sure you're for sure fatigue reduced
then you take the easy road out and make
sure you really cut the slack early
to give yourself as much runway as
possible but if you're just like
probably for yourself just trying to get
jacked and lean
look all of these faces are uh
only as indicated only as indicated by
your own physiology and psychology so if
you really feel like you need a
active rest phase nobody can tell you
that's not the answer but if you really
assess that you don't need one and
you're not bullshitting yourself an
active rest phase
james i was just imagining your your
training process as like a race car and
like one of your wheels has fallen off
and your muffler's hanging down like the
hood is over the windshield and you're
like you're still rolling just finish
i'm 100 meters away from the finish line
and the guy behind me is 200 meters out
i'm like go go go go go
[Laughter]
yeah um so i totally agree with dr mike
here um and i actually i'm running into
a similar situation myself where i've
run
three pretty hard training mezzos and i
was planning on taking a break
but uh i feel really good and i'm like
there's really like i'm not flat
i kind of did like my last one was kind
of a blend of like 10 to 20 and
metabolite stuff and normally for me
that would be like yeah it's about time
for a break but
don't need to take a break if you don't
feel like you really need to if you're
still getting pumps still having good
training like still
in one piece and your fatigue's in good
shape then just keep going
so you can always auto regulate these
things it should be based on a need not
just a
not purely pre-planned once you are an
intermediate when you're a beginner you
do more pre-planned things just because
you don't know
enough yet and sometimes your coach
might have or whoever's helping you
might have some insights that you don't
and then once you kind of hit that
intermediate stage you play around with
auto regulation a lot more
boom beautifully put james
the next person we will be answering a
question for is jason
marman who's like kind of like jason
mamoa but not as cool
because i can't
he looks like he's doing something crazy
in his his little thumbnail i can't
quite tell her sharon's doing something
all right here we go
got it hi doc's curious for taking the
fructose and muscle mass preservation on
hypocaloric
i presume that using fruits and veggies
as primary carb sources in a
hypochlorous diet not yield the same
muscle preserving benefits as carb
sources that are more glucose based
due to fructose being synthesized into
primarily liver glycogen instead of
muscle
tissue glucose is not synthesized
into muscle tissue but it is loaded as
glycogen
however if your liver is does not have
enough loading of glycogen anyway then
that will go there first your liver gets
priority all the time
so fructose being synthesized primarily
for liver glycogen keeps your liver
glycogen topped off
and because of that it will reduce uh
normal daily
uh stuff will reduce your you know if
you're eating a normal diet
less of the other carbs will go into
your muscles
and uh sorry less of the other carbs
would go into liver glycogen because
it's already tapped out and more
into muscles another quick thing is
fruits are like a huge fraction
sometimes 50
or more glucose so all fruits are
glucose fructose combos they're not pure
fructose
so this is not a problem but let's
continue on in particular i imagine the
liver glycogen helps the metabolism
generally in a huge way by the way
but specifically would not help at all
with maintaining performance it does
that in a huge way by keeping the blood
pressure
it maintains performance to a huge
extent number one is this line of
reasoning accurate it is accurate to
some degree but i would say 50
degree because most of these are glucose
fructose combos which means to just get
the best of kind of all worlds
uh is 100 calorie liver glycogen
equivalent performance maintenance 200
calories stored fat
it's better than the heart test or fat
by long shots more readily available
it actually keeps your blood sugar up
which fat does not um
that only keeps your brain going with
ketone conversion
and y'all know how that
 feels does not feel like blood
sugar
i love it i want a shirt that says
powered by ketones that i only wear
during my deload week
that's just like that guy's workout
looks like it sucks like yeah that's
what ketones do
i bet he has bad breath too those
 ketones dude
um a dude i was training with charlie
during one of his cuts i was buying him
a bench and he had like keto breath and
i was like charlie i'm going to die
i'm sorry i i can't even i don't know
what's going on here
it's bad it's bad number two
is it true that fructose is less
generally muscle preserving the glucose
i'm aware of no evidence that effect
how do you think about balance the
usefulness of these failing foods and
hypochlorous diet desired
for it to preserve muscle mass loving
consciousness so here's what i'm saying
if you want to drive as much hypertrophy
as possible insulin immediate
hypertrophy
glycogen loading craziness on your
massing phases you want to have plenty
of glucose and or starch that refers to
glucose and plenty of fructose too but
you don't want to go all fructose
on your fat loss phase man fructose is
low glycemic it's slow digesting fills
up liver glycogen it's really good stuff
and as long as you get some glucose it's
really not a problem so
i would say no one in a million years
has lost muscle because they're eating
fruit they're not grains
is it possible to eat so much fruit and
so few grains that you gain a little bit
less muscle on a surplus
maybe but then even that strange
credulity so i would say that this is
really not a big issue at all
and the fructose thing is no big deal as
long as you're not like somehow
consuming
exclusively fructose which i don't even
know what the you would get because
people say high fructose corn syrup is
only like 50 something percent fructose
or some like that actually let me
not lie to you guys just google that
um percent because these are readily
available numbers percent
fructose in high
there we go high corn syrup
uh so uh 42 or 55
fructose which means less the rest is
glucose and that's high fructose corn
syrup a lot of fruits do better than
that
so no big deal at all
yeah and i agree especially when you
factor in like the hunger
the satiety effects of eating things
like fruit and the health promoting
effects of having
you know fruits and vegetables like man
there's i don't know of any compelling
arguments that shows that like fructose
would have an adverse effect on
you know muscle maintenance so factoring
all those things in like it keeps you
full it keeps you healthy like
it's hard to argue against hard to argue
against having a high you know
fruits and veg diet even during mass
it's like
you could it's probably in your best
interest to have a pretty good amount of
those so long as it's not impeding you
from eating
enough food overall because it makes you
so full 100
next up oscar ozcar
oz car that sounds like oz fest except
it's a rental car service yeah yeah
james can you click read more you click
the other one oh oops
i always do that i'm like huh
it's gone isn't showing all right first
actually james
let's read real education let's take a
look at anthony nex's fixed bad posture
in 22 days works every time
i'm just god click on that look at that
funny that like that's like a real
picture
like all right now slump slump your
shoulders forward now stand up a little
bit less straight okay
no james that was taken one day at a
time
pictures it's not the same photo shoot
um the sun wasn't out on one of those
days
that's right it was like really great
like one was taken in london
like in the winter and the other one in
southern
[Laughter]
all right oscar says yo donkeys
as someone who is very content with my
current leg size
is running a viable option for cardio
considering how effective it is a
calorie burning oh it's ready i thought
running by
applying i was like applying a viable
option
um is running a viable option for cardio
considering how effective it is a
calorie burning will there be any
interference effect or mapper body
workouts other than cash venture uh
yeah if you go really hard running you
get a lot of just systemic fatigue
but i would say like jogging is a pretty
goddamn good cardio a huge
calorie burn so unless you're doing like
high-intensity interval training
i would say like a moderate-paced jog is
a great way if you don't care
about leg size
and your knees and hips and stuff can
tolerate it ankles
um then if you're really just cool with
your current leg size
because you continue to train your legs
you probably won't lose any leg size
just won't gain any
um i say running is an absolutely great
option if it works for you and if you
don't notice the stomach fatigue is too
high
no guarantees but i think it'd go pretty
well for you james
yeah i'm just i'm reading a little maybe
too deeply into the question but so you
know
the kind of the kind of seems to be two
diverging paths here where it says you
know is running a viable option for
cardio and then it also is kind of
hinting at
it's really good at calorie burning so i
would say you know if you just are
looking for something that's good at
calorie burning there's lots of options
and they don't even have to be low
intensity uh cardio like we normally
would recommend
there's lots of high high energy output
cardio options and running is just
you know one of them um if you're trying
to do
running to improve your your if you're
running for cardio
then that's a different kind of
discussion so this is one of those where
i would say i know this might sound
nitpicky but
you know doing a cardiovascular activity
for cardio versus doing it for energy
expenditure
you might have diverging um methods and
outcomes because you can kind of elicit
different
different effects and different goals
from those things so just for example
like you can get a huge energy uh
burning effect
from doing all sorts of stuff like doing
wrecking or doing
the elliptical or you know whatever you
can also get really really good cardio
from doing
hit intervals on a stationary bike so
you know it kind of depends on what you
are trying to get out of it if you want
to run because you want to get better at
running and you want that to be your
main source of cardio
i think that's totally fine um i think
like dr mike said you know you start
start slow like i would say if you
haven't run for a long time do like a
light
jog see how that twice a week and then
just kind of ramp up and see how you
know where you can get to
please for the love of god don't start
with sprinting or hit training stuff
like that
but maybe just reconsider why are you
doing the cardio are you doing it just
for energy expenditure or are you doing
it
to increase your cardiovascular
capabilities at some activity because
that might actually guide your choices
in different directions
boom
i always feel like we on running
sorry but it's you know it's i think
people forget that like running
makes you good at running like if you
want to burn calories you can do plenty
of other things you don't have to run
running
is an option but there's lots of other
things it's such an easily accessible
option for most people and it's been so
like
canonized in movies and media that like
people just equate
running you know james remember this he
used to piss us off back in
2010 they started first getting those
main i think nike adds out which just
said like athletes run
period and it's like a lot of athletes
running stupid like
twitter's run out of here i mean
like
if you look at um like energy
expenditure and like oxygen consumption
at different activities it's like okay
if you want the top ones
it's usually cross-country skiing some
form of running and strangely enough
boxing
and maybe that's just because they've
actually been able to measure that but
that's usually like top three so it's
like there's
three great both cardiovascularly
stimulative and
high energy output type activities turns
out they tend to go hand in hand
but 100 james bob wolf you don't even
have to type it in because he's just
right oh no right below
the wall got it all right
bob wolf says neck hypertrophy colon
what are the effects
to total mrv and any general ways to
approach this muscle group or should he
even be isolating the first place
i often see these muscles overlooked and
in my opinion they can really make a
break of physique in the same way as
lacking traps thoughts ps i sleep with
an ar-15 under my pillow that is a large
physically sized weapon to hammer
can't be comfortable you better have
that trigger lock on pretty tight
otherwise you're shooting people
in your sleep
um and have two psychopathic dopamine um
it's good that's good uh so i live in
like northern idaho
where the chance of anyone doing
anything is like also zero
um so here's the deal bob we're going to
look at james hoffman's screen there
screen shared and we are going to look
at the bottom video that has the full
caption listed and it says jeff nippert
jeff nippert is the world's mac
hypertrophy expert
and i would highly recommend his videos
he's figured that all out front to
back
um uh let me just answer a couple of
your questions real quick and see what
james has to say
what are the effects on total mrv minor
because neck training is that hard but
it will
interfere a little bit with back
training a little bit with uh shoulder
training because it would be tired
systemic mrv costs by low but something
that you know
everything added to the soup makes the
soup meatier um
and any general ways to purchase muscle
group again that's deferring straight to
jeff nippard
or should you even be isolating in the
first place to be honest man
no one i've seen that's trained their uh
lower body and upper back properly
as ever and shoulders has ever really
needed neck hypertrophy there's probably
one and
a hundred people will need that like
james's neck
uh james is all nattied out over there
like his neck looks like a fine neck it
looks like a perfectly concords with his
traps and shoulders
i wouldn't look at james and be like
 pencil neck loser like
you know he's never done an extra
session in his life wrong down over the
years which is good because it was
really big for a while for sure your
wrestler knack rugby neck like
yes you know it's also like you know if
you get big enough your neck starts to
actually give you sleep apnea
that's a that's another thing you're
like my neck's enormous but i've
never done a single neck thing in my
entire life probably never will
um now clearly you know in an alternate
universe i've hit the sauce a little bit
so that definitely helps but
look like even most natty folks their
neck is really well sized to everything
else another thing is like if you have a
really really big neck
sometimes it kind of detracts away from
your shoulder width um
so if you have a pencil neck and you've
tried everything else you've already do
high quality shoulder training with full
rom and everything like that
upper back stuff then yeah you can
consider next stuff and that's that's
for
uh jeff nipper to sort you out on that's
probably our best answer there
yeah i think that was really good like
it's like mike said i've never really
known anyone
personally who trained he does good
training and then you're like man you
really need to start working on that
neck you look terrible you know it just
almost never happens i do think there is
a place for
neck training in some select sport
applications like uh
grappling sports uh arguably things like
rugby and football there there may be a
case for that
um but for physique man i just i don't
know i don't feel like
like i said i've never really seen the
need i think sometimes
i'm not saying this is you bob here but
i think sometimes people think that like
if they are
if they're you know that their upper
body like their delts and the top of
their chest and stuff is kind of
not looking as good as they want they're
like oh maybe i'll work on my neck and
it'll make it look better it's like
no you just need to do more bench and
more lateral raises and then it will
come along
over time um that's just me being like
you know cynical and being kind of a
 but honestly i think that's
like 95
of the time when people think about neck
training it's like no just do more of
the other training and it will come
along
and i honestly having a big next pain in
the ass like i was saying mine has
shrunk down over these i used to have
like a 22
and so like buying shirts and stuff was
just awful i also have long arms
so it's like
finding like a dress shirt was always
just a nightmare and i'm glad it finally
came back down to a more reasonable size
because for a while it was like
huge and it was just a pain in the ass
100
james don't you scroll anywhere type
anything because sai
chilakuri is our next question oh you
you nailed that one i was like what the
i didn't i actually had to scroll
forward in my own list uh because my
is is different but luckily i was like i
remember that question oh he's like
number seven on our list so perfect just
what kind of
what kind of name do you think that is
uh i have no
i would say my best guess is somewhere
in the india bangladesh
pakistan no india bangladesh uh
myanmar region that would be my best
guess oh okay
interesting the uries they tend to be
from that uh general region of the world
i probably that all to hell it's
probably
i have no clue that's what i was
wondering i would have there's an anime
character on naruto named psy so i would
like japanese yeah
first name definitely seems japanese the
last name not japanese but maybe it is
who knows
yeah okay all right all right
what are your thoughts on rpe rating of
receive exertion versus percentage-based
programming for strength
what about hypertrophy training so i
think james and i are probably going to
share the same kind of opinion here but
that's just a prediction
i think percentages get you into the
general area and then rpes take care of
the rest
so james is that uh yeah so it's it's
like using a combination of both
subjective and objective measures the
percentages are like kind of your you're
more hard
evidence-based like here's what i did
here's what it should be kind of
mathematically
uh in terms of like your either your
efforts or your weights or your whatever
you're doing
and then you use kind of rpe or more
subjective measures like rir
things like that um to kind of help just
fine tune those and auto regulate them
into the correct place so
kind of like you would i think of the
percentage based or is more of like pre
pre-planning and then rpe and things
like that is kind of like
auto-regulation so why not both
um but i think some of these are maybe a
little bit better
suited for um strength training versus
hypertrophy you know for example
um you can rpe all you want for strength
but at some point if you don't move the
needle forward in terms of weight on the
bar
you won't get any stronger so that's
kind of even though using rpe for
strength is good at some point you
actually do have to use numbers to
actually guide that process
uh hypertrophy is kind of similar but in
a different way whereas like as long as
you are
training within a reasonable amount of
like whatever your pre-programmed range
of strength scores and for our purposes
we say anything between 5 and 30 reps
and that's
that's you know basically proxy for
intensity so anything in there
and within you know four to zero r
well you're pretty good like you're good
to go and you can use that rir scoring
as your subjective measure and then you
have a really wide range of objective
scores to
of repetitions to play around in so you
can use both in different ways
boom perfect all right
next up is vasil
v-a-s-i-l
got it he's got the arp he's got the rp
logo going
so i uh jared feather just walked in and
i was like
man i'm so glad to be peeking out with
this mass i'm finishing up this mess
and i just finished my huge container of
huge the
the mass gainer super mass gainer
serious mass uh from optimum nutrition
jared just walks in and he went to the
store and he like shows me this giant
thing of serious mass i'm like what the
he's a show is that for me
why god damn it are you on your
mind
i'm beautiful four more days i'm not
taking that with me
i'm leaving i hate this ass
i was like thinking i never had to hit
that again he just brings it in
all right and folks congratulations to
jarrett feather i think he placed
fifth in his first pro show fifth in his
first pro show
um you know i was i was surprised i was
like man
because i saw jared's like kind of the
pics he had been posting on instagram
leading up i was like damn
who beat jared and then i saw the top
three i was like oh that guy's huge oh
my god
for sure for sure for sure that's like
upper backs are really big
and yeah so but he's well on his way
yeah no congrats to him all right so
vasil asks what it do docs uh uh uh
that's a
great way to start a question sorry for
the long question but this has been
bothering me for some time now i could
just even see a little shower like
rooting ah mrv
pulls up to a taco bell starts to order
food they're like can you confirm your
order he's like never mind dries off
goes 90 down a straight away like all
right
mike have you ever read uh zen in the
art of motorcycle maintenance i haven't
but i've heard really good things about
it
so i literally just i've read it and i
just the main character basically goes
through this existential crisis and then
it causes him to go into psychosis sorry
spoiler alert i was just imagining vasil
having the same he's thinking about mrv
and it causes him to have like a
psychotic breakdown
holy sorry tangent
oh hold on jared's showing me things
uh points oh you have points
you had you got a point two you got two
points for your show
can you trade them for money
uh he got points to qualify for the
olympia so hopefully he can get some
more and quality oh sweet
is he gonna is he gonna try and knock
out another one while he's in good shape
here or is he correct he's probably
going to do the show in mexico tijuana
now i've been to tijuana a few times
it's never for bodybuilding show well
it's a show of some kind
i'm just gonna shut up oh god do you
want it it's like a bodybuilding show
with humans and animals at the same time
good luck i hope he says
don't get montezuma's revenge either or
like kidnapped by the cartels
yeah i would also say that what i saw at
the tijuana was uh
you know definitely physiques were seen
uh
not as lean and different posing very
different poses
so different posing it's a donkey show
james is where the woman has sex with
the donkey
oh god damn it yeah i was like those
poses are standard what are you talking
about
like it's so you go to a donkey show
with your friends and the woman comes
out and just gets like front last breath
you're like this is actually better than
i thought it was going to be the donkeys
very nice like don't be shredded as
dude that's what we need is animal
bodybuilding do you think that would be
ethical like
get your bulldogs
kangaroos would take would would take it
those big reds
jeez for sure although i don't know a
clydesdale horse in peak
condition good god
horses are so muscular but like they're
so wussy they
like anything happens to them and they
die it's all like
your your like horse maintenance
checklist is like
is it like hooves and teeth okay is it
stomach okay put it down just shoot it
there's not they just die so easily i've
been like because you know mel's like
into the equine stuff now and it's like
the horses will just like see a puddle
panic like fall
down and they're just dead you just have
to kill them at that point
 this they're these massive
beautiful and like
veiny muscular they weigh like a
thousand pounds or more
you know sometimes and it's like you're
so big and sturdy but so
fragile at the same time i used to look
at horses and be like god look at how
buff that thing is now i'm like that
thing's going to die it's going to see
this machine
stump and panic and die yeah i think
like once they break their legs they're
kind of sol
right i mean if they like lay on their
stomachs for too long their sol they
just die
really easily i don't i don't know i'm a
horse rant here but yeah
yeah all right vasil says i'm asking
this because
uh oh wait hold on
i think we need to scroll up oh ooh
sorry yes do major muscle groups which
have a higher mrv
also have a higher mev and mv
um usually yes
i'm asking this because only in week one
of meso two meso one and two out of
three total
um when i was
was when my lats got mildly sore and
then they were just kind of stiff after
workouts
i had a volume based on the repetitions
from previous weeks to meet target ir
and also on the degree of soreness which
is non-existent almost
usual progression for week one to four
goes like this meso one
twelve fourteen seventeen twenty one
meso two fourteen to twenty two meso
three
fifteen to twenty one although
significantly improved training quality
extra selection my muscle connection
and rarely step below seven reps i'd
give an exercise
i still can't reliably my lats up
like i can chest
quads are rhomboids and lastly when i
hit my v on lats it's more of a gassing
out type of failure except in pullovers
meaning they're not really ready to
rupture from other worldly stimulus when
they fail
right just can't complete the movement
anymore send me to the
higher initial volume question and
bigger volume jumps weeks week
is this potentially the answer or have i
skipped over qualitative solutions
around the quantitative
ps even though i i bought versa groups a
while ago and overall sfr is better
because of the meticulously hand picking
exercise is very good
so here's the thing about lats
fundamentally the way that your lats
insert
uh or originate and uncertainty your
body you cannot put them under the kind
of
insane stretch that you can other
muscles let me give you a list of
muscles
you can put under unreal stretch glutes
in some situations you got to get kind
of creative
hamstrings are the knee key muscle you
could do that with
triceps calves chest and quads have you
ever had trouble getting those sore
because if you have
just training them properly and getting
a real darling stretch you'll fix all
those problems
your muscles that have trouble getting
stretched under tension biceps
all the shoulder muscles traps lats
much of the back musculature probably
you've had
trouble getting those muscles sore
that's probably the reason stretch under
you know gender under um stretch is a
really great stimulus for hypertrophy
and it also causes a load of
soreness so i wouldn't worry about your
last not getting sore
i would just get a real good pump real
good stimulus and then scale up the
volume as needed from there
uh lats just don't get really super sore
consistently
if you could detach them from your uh
humerus
and then a human eye and you could
independently train them with a crazy
psycho range of motion they would get
super sore and they probably
would grow more too
but just do your best so this is why for
james and i have especially is upsetting
when people cut the range of motion on
rowing and pulling
now vertically because it's like your
lats already mechanically don't go
through a range of motion
now you're like doing even less the
is wrong with you so that's my answer
james
yeah very good um so just back to the
first one uh
the volume landmarks for muscle groups
tend to kind of flow
together not always but like if you see
shifts moving
up you know you'll start to see general
trends of the other ones moving up so if
you find like your mrv's been going up
your mev is probably coming up maybe not
as aggressively
likewise mv might be marginally moving
up so
those are just general shifts and when
you take time off right you see the
reverse happen after you know if you
take like a re-sensitization phase or a
d-load you'll see
they shift back to the i'd say to the
left which means like less sets needed
to get the
result so that is common one thing with
lats uh share your pain i think most
people share your pain on this
especially um
somebody who has mechanically
unfavorable i got those
gumby arms so training lats for me is uh
usually very challenging one thing that
i've been experimenting with because my
lats
almost never get sore you know what gets
my lat sores stiff-legged
deadlifts that's the only thing
that generally will get my lat sore
great super helpful
but one thing i've been playing around
with lately on this last meso
which i had some limited success more
success than i've ever had
was doing a lot more pre-fatigue on the
lats so i've been doing things like
cable
straight arm lats before i do pull downs
and stuff like that and i've been doing
uh i
am fortunate that my setup i can do a
full
fully stretched paw wait touch the stack
pause
so i've been doing the pre-fatigue cable
lats and then i'll do a full
pause top stretch um and then pull down
to
like nipples chest on my pull downs and
then that actually has caused my lats to
get sore
these last meso or two so give that a
try play around with that see if that
helps
great answer all right will murray is up
next
sure it's not bill murray
pretty close william aka bill murray i
mean that's
they probably have the same formal first
name all right
will murray says high docks when coming
back off
coming back from a layoff and having
lost quite a bit of muscle do you think
it's best to bulk or maintain
to regain the lost muscle thanks i think
it's best to maintain because muscle
loss
uh when it occurs gaining it back is
very easy
plus you don't need the power of
hypercaloric eating when you're coming
back from a layoff you don't want to get
super fat and if you start
gaining right after layoff you can get
pretty fat so just like when we say when
new people start training we usually
have them just go into maintenance for a
while
and gain muscle moves at the same time
pretty much the same advice for folks
that have come back from a layoff
um after that you'll be pretty lean and
pretty jacked and you could do like a
little mini cut or even just start
gaining
and then it'll be kind of the best of
all worlds when muscle retention or sort
of muscle
uh regaining is so easy you don't have
to use and you don't have to sort of
fatigue your best weapons hypercaloric
diet
in order to do so you don't have to get
all the other uh
you know like all the other sort of
negative side effects like feeling like
 and eating so much food
yeah i totally agree and in sport
training we would kind of we would call
this a return to fitness type phase
where you're coming off of either
inactivity or an injury or both
and you really are not treating it like
a mass or a cut phase you're really
treating it as what we call return to
fitness meaning
you're just building back up your
tolerance to training stimulus so
you start low and you ramp up you know
notably week to week until you know
maybe a month or two goes by and you're
getting pretty close to what you were
doing before which is great but that
whole time you're regaining ability
tolerance and very likely going to be
gaining some muscle mass back along the
way so there's really no incentive to
cut or mass unless you just want to make
your life unnecessarily difficult
or just get fatter than necessary so i
think dr mike's suggestion on
maintenance is the way to go
boom all right the next person
up is jason predict json
oh jason marmon jason predict got it
there he is
all right do you recommend including
regular deadlifts for hypertrophy
yes as long as their stimulus to fatigue
ratio is good for you
or you really can't gain muscle in the
spinal erectors traps and rhomboids
you need something with crazy raw
stimulus magnitude
so if you're including deadlifts in your
training and i ask you a question like
hey do deadlifts really beat you up so
much that it really hurts the rest of
your training you're like no they're
great fit right into my program
deadlifts are excellent
for a perch free training if i ask you
the question of like hey listen
why are you doing deadlifts and you say
look they me up they fatigue me
like they really interfere with
other muscle
training but they're so effective to
build up my spinal erectors rhomboids
and traps
that if i don't do them i just don't get
the kind of back growth that i want then
that's good i give you deadlifts
either one of those things apply then
it's probably not a good idea to do
deadlifts for example
if i say to you hey like are you really
trying to bring up your back do that
rose not working like actually
bent rows and stuff work really really
well for me stuff like that left in
addition to that rose
with some uh good mornings grow my back
a ton and then i'm like i see you doing
dead lifts you know
yeah gotta keep in the big three right
brother i'm like no you don't
well let me ask you another question how
fatigued or dialed do they really
me up i wish i didn't have to do them
good news you don't have to do them
because you seem to have no problem
grading you know getting a huge stimulus
for your back
from other exercises to me that's how
the cookie crumbles
uh james what do you think yeah i
totally agree and what
we see more often than not is kind of
that late intermediate stage
lifter who has been using deadlifts
traditionally at some point starts to
make a switch to things like stiff
legged deadlifts
and like good morning variations just
because the cost of doing and in this
case as dr mike described it like the
fatigue that you get
from doing it just doesn't outweigh uh
or doesn't excuse me outweighs the
benefit that you gain from them they
just become so
either locally and or systemically
fatiguing that it just inhibits your
ability to do a lot of other things
and so uh to accommodate that a lot of
people will start switching to things
like stiff legged deadlifts good
mornings which still hit a lot of that
same
muscle groups but really can hit the
hams and the glutes a little bit more
just directly then kind of the
all-around
activity of the deadlift so i think it's
a great one for beginners
um it's still useful for people who are
kind of in that early intermediate stage
and then typically you know i know this
is like splitting hairs here but that
late intermediate stage
it's not so much that it's not useful
it's just that the cost has
skyrocketed and the benefit has just
trickled down as a result of their
training age so
at that point it's better to find
something else that serves a
more specific purpose and in this case
we usually say why don't you pick
a posterior chain movement that really
just nails the posterior chain rather
than kind of hitting everything at the
same time
100
[Music]
next up is apex k
got it all right so he asks best way to
fix bad movement patterns i have a
tendency for the barbell to shift
left from over tucking my right arm on
the bench
so i actually have just recorded and
it'll be out
she's they're probably out like
three or four months because we're
really out of schedule all the time at
uh
rp or the rp studio um
it's an entire video dedicated to how to
do this and whether or not it's even a
good idea
but a quick preview is the best weapon
you have is twofold
one find out if this is at all relevant
because sometimes everyone's bodies
built a little different everyone's has
asymmetries it might just be like
nothing is different and your muscles
all look kind of pretty similar and
just some weird stuff happens when you
lift and it's not hurting you
um no clicking no popping and then you
might not have to fix
 um because that tucking could be
making up for something else in the
chain that's different so for example
you know your uh radius and all the
bones could be slightly differently
long on one arm versus the other and
then your
you know humeral length um can be
also slightly different but in the
opposite direction making your arms just
as long as one another
but because there's a ratio difference
in order for the mechanics of the bench
press coming down and up to work without
blowing your elbows out
one has to talk more than the other if
you think about it you're like oh i
probably wouldn't look different
coming out so it wouldn't look the same
coming down they look different if you
try to fix that you're actually
fixing the fix and then and then you
have a problem
right um so you know there's
you know it's kind of like saying if you
have really huge rims on your car
that you bought and then you have to
make bigger bigger tires so the rooms
don't scratch the road
if you try to fix the big tire problem
the rims start scratching the road it
gets
well one of those is the fix for the
other and your body makes auto fixes
like that all the time
so just make sure that there's no real
problem to fix there and
and that's point number one point number
two is the best way to fix something
is to reduce the proximity to failure
reduce the overall load you're using
and actively practice good technique
while using other exercises that hit the
muscle group where you don't have to fix
them
so you basically turn the exercise maybe
at the end of a session
a couple times a week you just exercise
very very far from failure
very light load and you relearn the
movement pattern to do properly then
once that movement panel is really set
in
you slowly increase the approximate
failure you slowly add weight to the bar
and eventually you really stay like a
hawk on making sure that those movement
patterns of bad ones don't return
and then after a while you've
reintegrated now your new movement
patterns your new pattern probably gonna
have to keep an eye on it for
at least a few months even when that
happens to make sure it doesn't revert
back
but that's a pretty good start as far as
an answer is concern
james really good i just want to point
this out
on my screen uh sky news australia the
leader of the free world is cognitively
delinquent delinquent is a funny way to
put it because
it's like he doesn't care like yeah i
think he's disabled not delinquent i
think he's
he's just senile um all right yeah so i
agree with dr mike i think
that point number two that he made i i
say honestly that
this is my opinion but that corrects
like 97
of of all problems and the thing that i
think most people struggle with is
they're like well
my techniques fine but when i do 135
pounds on bench i get my you know elbows
tucked well take it down to 95. like
that's gonna fix it like the people are
just reluctant to
take the weight down and i know it's
such a basic thing and it just
pulls at your ego heartstrings but
that's the way to do it
take the weight down until you can do it
the
way that you want whatever you think is
a perfect repetition that or what it
should be
take it to a weight that you can do all
perfect repetitions
and when you start like schmidt around
too much you're just you're always going
to default
to kind of your what you know right and
if what you know is this
this bad technique any time the goal
gets tough you're going to default back
to that right so the idea being
this is going to be like re programming
your motor learning which takes a long
time
so in this case take the weight down
focus on um like your mind muscle
connection so you're adjusting the new
technique that has more sound
biomechanics
also so that it's still training the
muscles that you want so you might so
what a lot of people will do
and sorry i'm ranting a little bit but a
lot of people would okay well now i'm
going to fix my
bench technique but now i don't feel it
in my pecs anymore okay well then it's
not serving the purpose that it's meant
to serve
so now you got to readjust again now i
got to find out how can i do it so it's
still
feeling in my packs but i'm not doing
the thing that i didn't want to do
now i got to take the weight down focus
on mind muscle connection focus on good
mechanics and go from there
it's there's really no other way to do
it that's that's kind of the key point
here is
i'm telling you whenever somebody's like
how do i fix like my my knee valgus
take the weight down when you're
squatting until your knees don't
valgus anymore like and just keep doing
that like there's no
there's no other way what about what if
i do
banded glute like you know side raises
like yeah okay but you're still going to
have the same problem like
just take the weight down 100
[Music]
last up in the stack is
toe mare there's two questions we want
the first
naruto avatar lame
oh i'm gonna get a lot of for that
all right i love naruto
in terms of strength is more volume
slash sets
in the five to ten three to five reps
equals more strength gains if not then
why not just do one to two sets
of compound in five to seven range and
then do back offsets in eight to twelve
or even higher with certain exercise
because it might be less fatiguing and
perhaps
less injury risks yeah so
um you there's a certain amount of
volume
that you can do in the heavy loading
regions
like the three to six rep regions which
increases your strength the most
effectively
and as long as you fill up that volume
you're getting strength as effectively
as possible
if you do a lot of other work in any
other rep ranges like even the five to
ten
definitely the eight to twelve you're
getting a bit more of a hypertrophy
stimulus but less of a straight stimulus
because you could have been doing more
strength work
so yes multiple sets in the three to six
rep range is probably the best way to
get strength at least in the short
medium term
in the long term of course you need to
come back and put on some muscle and get
that muscle stronger
but generally speaking that's really the
deal which is why you see a lot of
powerlifting programs
for by really good athletes have
multiple sets of three to six reps in
some paradigm or another
and there's just no getting around that
like if you have another if you've done
one set of three to six
you said i want to continue to get
strong as possible not just big
your question is next should we do a set
of h12 or should your next step be
another set of three to six
man you know another set of 3d6 is
probably that correct answer
until you reach pretty close to your mrv
and when you want to prioritize away
from strength and towards hypertrophy
which james and i would say should
probably be another phase
then you do most of your work in the
five to 10 eight to 12 range
and you would split it up like that yeah
and this is just like one of those
instances of diverging goals and
specificity like
can you get a hypertrophy stimulus from
doing sets of three to five
yeah sure it's just outside of kind of
our optimal bell curve which we have
identified as somewhere between five and
thirty reps for hypertrophy as a
specific goal
however three to five reps is like the
apex
of the strength curve right in terms of
like long-term sustainability and you
know injury risk things like that so
it's just two diverging things at that
point and it seems nitpicky it's like
what's the difference between
you know two reps you say three is too
heavy but five is hypertrophy
there's definitely some overlap some you
know they're they're not totally
mutually exclusive
but there do have to be some reasonable
cutoff points that we can quantify and
so far
that's what we have identified kind of
in the literature and through
experiences somewhere between 5 and 30
is generally
hypertrophy are you going to get a
little bit of strength sure it's just
not the best strength stimulus
somewhere between one and five is
strength are you going to get some
hypertrophy
yeah just not as good as if you did the
hypertrophy range but so they do overlap
quite a bit
um and as mike said at that point you
just want to take if you're looking for
both take a phasic approach that's the
best way to do it
boom by the way not a question but we'll
answer it anyway
timothy and navaratil says right below
tamir
damn i missed it live and the the thing
is we don't do live
so you didn't miss anything good news
yeah i mean half the time we just text
each other and we're like okay
we're doing it today yeah let's do it
all right let's go
so there's not like a schedule that you
you missed or anything so don't worry
about it
um all right was there any was that it
or is there any more
that's it that's ten okay
well that was pretty good we got some
good questions today dr mike any uh
any housekeeping any rp stuff people
need to know about
yeah i'm doing a collaboration with
good old coach greg ducette um
and uh we recorded a bunch of content
and where he's slowly releasing all that
so go on his channel and
uh like and comment on that and
then you know talk some over there
and bring up some of his users back here
so
that's it that's always more stuff in
the works always more great youtube
content
and yeah all right i got my fingers in a
couple rp pies though i'm not sure how
much i'm supposed to talk about those so
we'll just say don't talk about them
there we go so they're there you heard
it from the man himself don't talk about
them so
also james please don't put your fingers
into pius that's disgusting
i can do it american pie style put
something else in there
[Music]
right or put your fingers into a
metaphorical pie so to speak
a little slice down there um okay i
think that's it guys thanks for joining
us for this week
uh if you are enjoying our banter and
nonsense go ahead and subscribe
there's all sorts of i can't even
believe how many goddamn videos are on
this youtube channel every time i try to
look for the the most recent q a i'm
like what is all this what is mike
even talking about at this point what is
wrong with this guy
he just puts out so many videos so if
you guys are into exercise nutritional
science bodybuildings periodization
sports
we got you covered so make sure you
subscribe and keep an eye out for
new videos every week in the meantime
we'll see you next week
