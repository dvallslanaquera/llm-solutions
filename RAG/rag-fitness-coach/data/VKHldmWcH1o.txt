hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
prioritization rp plus rpu
and our third lecture in advanced
hypertrophy concepts
is on overload threshold dynamics
whoa what is that well
what are we going to talk about today
we're going to talk about uh what the
heck
all the threshold dynamics are we're
going to define overload which is super
important
we're going to talk about what the
overload ranges are for tension how much
weight you're lifting
relative intensity it's how close to
failure you're going volume
and frequency of training and then we're
going to talk about the changing nature
of overload because what used to be
overloading yesterday
may not be as overloading today and how
we uh sort of imply that into training
how change the training can change
then of course we're going to do
programming recommendations just to get
the mean potatoes out of it and
summary and implications so
what are overload threshold dynamics
well it's basically a series of
explorations
into the overload principle of training
and what it implies
because if we really deeply understand
the overload principle of training which
is what we're going to try to do here
today
it automatically implies a bunch of
stuff for training and how you can
program
that might not be immediately obvious if
you're not so sure what overload is
or if you're under an idea of overload
that is not correct
right um and of course we have to
explain what overload is we have to
define it and very deeply explain that
definition
so that we know that the overload
definition is covering every aspect that
we need
once we do that we can define what
various overload thresholds are because
there are various variables of training
that make you grow
how heavy you're training how close to
failure you're training
how much you're training in a given
session and how many sessions you do per
week
all of these have to be hard enough to
cause the best gains
thus the overlord principle applies to
them so we're going to talk about how it
applies to them once we understand what
it really is
and of course once we understand all
that stuff we can give pretty finite
pretty decent
least beginning recommendations for
programming and these recommendations
aren't like do x y and z
they're like you know if you do design
programs
they should have these features probably
and if they don't have these features
they may be suffering from
some kind of uh inefficiency or lack of
effect
right programming can have just like one
box checked and three boxes unchecked
and still work
but we're here to make sure it works as
best as it can right
so on that note let's define overload
what does the overload principle mean
uh a lot of people think that
overloading and unfortunately it's kind
of sort of
couched in it's the the verbal
definition almost if you just look at
the dictionary
or overloading itself means overloading
as is
here's like loading and here's always
overloading is over at the
people are sort of can't blame people
for thinking
overloading must be more than you've
ever done before
or more than you're used to or something
like that
so the term has a little bit of a
problem but it turns out
it doesn't uh overloading training
doesn't have to be
harder than ever before okay so if you
squat at 135 for a set of 10
on monday on wednesday you don't
actually have to squat
at least 140. you can do 135 for another
set of 10
just the same as you did on monday and
it probably will still be overloading
so what does that mean how can 135 again
be
overloading well overloading really
means
that a stimulus has to be above the
threshold
of systemic function of that system that
elicits robust adaptation so in other
words
if training is sufficiently challenging
not maximally challenging
then reliable adaptation actually occurs
this applies to every single system so
for example if you
are reading various literature to become
a better appreciator of let's say
eastern literature
does every single successive book and
article on eastern literature that you
read
have to push your mind absolutely to a
level that's never gone before really
struggling with ideas
in order for you to get better
understanding western literature no as a
matter of fact you can get a better
understanding of sorry eastern
literature if you read one book on it
and then you literally re-read the same
book that's no no there's no novelty
at all in that there's no accession of
any
previous limits but you know it was
really challenging when you started
reading it the first time
the second time it's still challenging
enough to make you
better now of course as you can probably
tell if you start reading the book third
fourth fifth sixth time at some point
you're going to totally plateau in any
kind of gains and understand you're
going to make because you basically get
everything you can out of that book
but just like a book just like a
conversation with somebody
just like uh training
just one exposure doesn't completely
desensitize you to further benefits
right so really
uh tr you could say that
training that's much easier than what is
in your overload threshold
is just not a reliable way to produce
adaptations just the same way that if
you
are you know already pretty close to an
expert on eastern literature
and you read like a wikipedia article
about it you might like skim the article
and be like
there's nothing in here that made me any
better at understanding eastern
literature because it's so far beneath
my level of understanding
not that it's wrong and somebody who
knows nothing about each other for them
it is overloading but for you it is no
longer
right so a better term for the overload
threshold
right the overload threshold is
literally saying here's all the stimuli
you can be exposed to from easiest to
the
most you can possibly do to yourself the
overload threshold
is some point right here
which gives us an overload window or
overload range
above it and all the way goes goes up to
maximal
and it's within here that things are
sufficiently challenging
to promote adaptations so a better term
for the overload threshold is
reliable stimulus threshold that is
anything below here
can it make you better maybe but it
might not
so it's just not a reliable way to
produce adaptations so basically if
someone can potentially lift
the 20s for sets of 10 challenging
if you give them the fives and they just
do sets of 10 with them is it reliably
going to cause
any muscle growth you just can't bet on
it right so the overload
threshold isn't like what they have to
if they can do the 20s for sets of 10
they have to do the 20s for instance 11
with the 21s for sets of 10.
not necessarily it's the minimum amount
of weight and or reps in or sets or
whatever that is going to get
some growth going that's the overload
threshold and we can debate later and we
will about what the optimal is within
there but
you know maybe the 15s for sets of 10
aren't going to cause
maximum adaptation but they probably
still do something they might
still cause some hypertrophy so you know
maybe better to call it a reliable
stimulus threshold it's a bit late for
that everyone knows
the overload threshold will keep the
overload turn but remember overload
doesn't mean
the most ever it means in that range
that is challenging to the system and
elicits adaptations which is to say
reliably causes growth
that is like somewhere in the range of
optimal
right if something causes like
technically gains a gram of muscle over
the course of a week
yeah sure you could say it reliably
causes growth but it's not any growth
you're going to write home about so
something that
is there aren't any many alternative
ways of training that are 50 times
better than it or something like that
so here's the thing though we say okay
there's this overload range right and
there's the overall threshold that's the
border into that range or low threshold
at the bottom
maximum ability to train at the top
right but that begs the question of how
challenging
training has to be to a system's
abilities in order to actually cause
improvement it does depend on the system
now um it really
for a variety of systems has been well
studied here's an example that's not
hypertrophy related just to show you
that we do actually know
uh some things very precisely in this to
reliably
uh train for power improvement um
in well-trained individuals it's been
shown that anything below 90
of peak power like a clean and jerk or
something or a jump that's below 90
peak power doesn't reliably improve a
trained individual's power output
so the overload threshold for power for
trained individuals is roughly 90
which is to say that if you always lift
at 85 peak power and you're expecting to
become more powerful
your expectations are probably going to
be wrong right is it 90
for everything no absolutely not
sometimes it's a higher percentage
sometimes it's a lower percentage
but there is a percentage generally
speaking it's close to a system's limit
right so this is really good news
because it offers us
[Music]
kind of a very simple analysis uh to for
lack of a better word shit test whether
or not we think we're training hard now
all the science aside we'll give you a
bunch of numbers and recommendations
but i'll tell you this um at the very
core of the overload principle
at the very core of the idea of where
the overall threshold has to be
is is generally it's close to a system's
limits which means that you can take
this insight into training and
do the following if in any one of the
categories we're going to be analyzing
today
how heavy a weight is how close to
failure you are
how much you're doing in a session and
how many sessions you're doing per week
if you're very far away from your
ability to execute
then it's not likely that you're going
to be giving the best adaptations or
really any adaptations at all
which is to say that if someone
describes a training is like
ridiculously easy super infrequent teeny
tiny bits of volume
and this says hey this is the best way
to grow you got to be super skeptical
and if you look back on your own
training
you're like man i've been really taking
it easy in the gym and you're expecting
this training to cause growth it's
probably not the case now does this mean
that you have to look back on your
training be like i've literally been
trying to kill myself in the gym
as often as possible as hard as possible
as much volume as possible is that the
only way to get growth almost certainly
not for almost all people
but most individuals especially
intermediates and above
training's got to be hard if training
isn't challenging if it doesn't feel
like a challenge if you're not done with
a session
or done with a week of training or even
done with a set a working set and you're
not like
oh well something right
if that's not the case you're probably
not getting better right you're probably
not adding muscle
right but we can do better than that so
we can give more specific
recommendations by looking at four
specific very important training
variables
figuring out where their overload
thresholds probably are
we're going to start with tension and
just to say loading how much weight is
on the bar so to speak
relative intensity which is how close to
failure are you taking any specific set
volume which is to say how many sets
working sets you're doing per
actual per workout uh and per session we
call it
and then lastly frequency how frequent
your
training sessions are throughout the
week how many of them you're doing
basically
per muscle group once we combine all
those if we know what the overall
thresholds are for those
then we got a pretty good insight on how
hard training needs to be to reliably
cause adaptation
really really really important if at the
end of this program or sorry at the end
of this
television program at the end of this
lecture
you'll be able to really literally have
a checklist that you can apply to your
own training and ask yourself is my
training likely overloading
all right is am i meeting am i above the
overall threshold at least most of my
training and if the answer is yes you're
good to go
right uh and we'll talk about more
specifics of a sort of a search for more
optimal within that threshold a little
bit later in this lecture as well
so without further ado the tension
overload range
direct research especially over the last
several years has found a couple of cool
things
first thing number one here working sets
even when taken close to failure which
we'll talk about in the next
slide is where the next topic is uh very
very important
even hard working sets lighter
much lighter than right around 30 of one
rep max
are not reliably or optimally
hypertrophic
which is to say that if you do uh some
working sets of
20 of your one rep max you may cause
muscle growth that's detectable
or if you're sufficiently advanced
especially because beginners kind of
grow from everything
um you might not cause any muscle growth
that's detectable
um and if you do let's say we repeat
this experiment of you trying twenty
percent
of your own rem for working sets even if
it causes reliable hypertrophy which
could it could very well cause
it's very unlikely to cause optimal
hypertrophy so for example one study
actually directly compared sets of 20
repetition max
just sets a 40 repetition max and it
showed that the 40 repetition max sets
it something like double the hypertrophy
of the 20. i mean
g like that's a real serious insight
note
60 percent of 1rm had basically no
difference than 40 right so it's not
just like oh it was double
right it's not just that there's
something inherently about a weight
being probably too light
maybe not stimulating a muscle's ability
to detect tension
nearly enough for it to say okay well
there's enough tension there's a reason
for hypertrophy
hit it boys and speak into its own
intracellular mechanisms right
at some point the weight may just be too
light and that point maybe
something significantly below 30 percent
one rep max right
we'll see in a graph we're going to
display in the next slide that it's
definitely a sliding scale it's not like
you know 29 you have zero growth and at
30 you have
exactly the same growth as you would
anywhere else it's a sliding scale but
that slide is
notable right around that 30 mark on the
other hand they've tested
loads all the way up to 100 plus percent
of owner m which is you can do
overload eccentrics like 110 of your uh
one rep max you can
slowly lower a smith machine bench press
for example then research per
the research team slide some of the
weights off and you press back up some
fraction of it
working sets as heavy as 100 plus 1rm
have been shown to be reliably
hypertrophic
okay sweet so we get reliable
hypertrophy anywhere between 30
and 100 of 1rm okay cool cool looks like
we sort of have an overload threshold
there
and notice when i said that sometimes
uh the overall threshold is really close
to a system's limit abilities sometimes
it's
not super close this is an example where
it's not super close you would think
like okay
how am i gonna grow muscle it's gotta be
at least 90 of one rep max
uh that's actually not true thirty
percent very few people speculated even
five years ago that thirty percent was
light enough to cause hypertrophy or
sorry heavy enough to cause perturbative
but it turns out that is in fact very
likely the case
so a couple of problems with that right
100 plus percent on rm or is fine
it causes reliable muscle growth but
unfortunately anything much over 85
plus 1rm though it does cause
basically as much growth as any other
rep or as any other
uh intensity range any other loading
range tension range
as low as 30 percent one of them it's
got the very very added problem
of per repetition and per set the amount
of fatigue generated by training like
that
is massive and is very disproportionate
so
can you hypothetically accumulate enough
volume do enough sets and reps
at 95 one rm to equal the hypertrophy
you would get at seventy percent one
round
you could but you could not do that
reliably because after several training
sessions you would start to accumulate
so much fatigue
you won't be able to perform anymore you
start to get weaker you start to get
likely injured and your hypertrophic
stimulus actually declines at a
biochemical level
so at least in the medium term
because there could be some nuances here
with periodization
working sets in the 30 to 85 percent one
rm range
right anything above 85 is not
sustainable but between 30 and 85
they're absolutely going to provide
overload stimulus
very likely okay they're that's the
overload threshold more or less
so at least in the medium term 30
percent of owner empty 85
1rm looks like an overload threshold at
least in the several months of training
anywhere between there actually seems to
cause roughly an equivalent amount of
hypertrophy roughly an equivalent
it's a very very likely future research
will show that some parts of that range
are more optimal
for some people under some conditions so
on and so forth we can fairly sure that
if we walk into a gym and we see someone
lifting with 35 percent of runner-up max
and they're doing hard sets close to
failure
we can't automatically be like bro
that's too light right uh
no it could very well be causing
reliable hypertrophy and probably is
right because most of us don't do one
rep maxes on like
cable upright rows how the hell are we
supposed to know what thirty percent of
that is
most bodybuilding or hypertrophy
training is not on the compound
you know lifts that we normally max out
on that is the squat bench and deadlift
i mean i don't even know how to max out
on a pull-up that would be like sort of
i don't know i don't know if
my shoulders would be huge fans of that
sort of thing so how do we gauge this
well
luckily for most people it's a very very
broad average
sets of five repetitions on a first set
to 30 repetitions on a first set
basically very close to failure roughly
correspond
to that thirty percent one 1rm to 851
range so if
a weight is so heavy for you that you
can only get it four times on a first
set
gee you know it's probably too heavy and
it's probably in excess of eighty five
percent
run around and it's going to be too
fatiguing in the long term or even in
the medium term
over several weeks for it to be a good
idea to lift for hypertrophy
on the other hand if you can do like 40
or 50 reps on a first set
it might be too light of a weight it
might be south of that 30 one rm
and then all of a sudden it's not a good
idea so because you're not going to try
to max out everything all the time
that 5 to 30 is really really good it
comes in really really handy so if you
don't
try and lat pull downs and you want to
do a hypertrophic set
and you start to move the bar and you
can clearly tell this is going to be
like a 50 rep set just stop
counter doesn't warm up put more weight
on the bar until you know it's going to
be between 5 and 30 reps
the very simplest way you're going to at
least get some muscle growth out of that
so
if we graph this relationship which is
really important to visualize it
so we're on slide number seven here and
we have on the y-axis how much growth we
have
per set growth stimulus percent how much
growth machinery is being activated
and on the x-axis we have percent of 1rm
as far as how much tension is applied
we'll start on the left side at the very
beginning of the graph the end of the
green line here at that zero percent
which clearly zero percent of tension
elicits
zero hypertrophy okay these are not
lifting anything like
that you in the space shuttle doing this
okay and what do astronauts that go to
space
in the space shuttle and do this with
various tools with no resistance come
back they come back losing
10 15 20 pounds of muscle so definitely
not hypertrophic
but as we slide up to 20
you'll notice that and this is a bit of
a hypothetical graph but
there's probably some hypertrophy that
occurs maybe it's only enough
hypertrophy
to like grow your legs as much as they
need to walk but when you think about
like when you walk up and down the
stairs
uh that's probably sort of like 20 of
your max legs ability to push which
includes your body segment weight above
your knees
and it's going to cause some hypertrophy
it absolutely will
there's nowhere close to optimal then we
see this big inflection point here
where this inflection line basically
between 20 and 40 percent or 20 and 35
to 1rm where anything much above 30
percent
is roughly equivalent now i try to make
this a little bit more of a speculative
graph to what i think is probably the
correct
um the very depth of the true anther
answer which is i think that
hypertrophy yield by very small margins
probably increases up to about 70
1rm uh but then probably flat lines
after that but
super moot point you can just see this
last part of the segment
anything from 35 all the way to 100 and
above is probably a roughly straight
line and any difference there is going
to be very small
all right so we know that we have to
train a certain
degree of heavy but in that entire
conversation we talked about
okay working sets working sets have to
be between 30
and whatever because clearly warm-up
sets don't have to be anything they're
just warm upsets they don't count for
growth
working sets are sets that are done with
the intended purpose of eliciting
hypertrophy not preparing to listen
hypertrophy but actually stimulating it
well these are called working stats are
also called hard
why are they called hardsides well if
you stop
way short of muscular failure it's been
demonstrated pretty reliably
that you're not guaranteed reliable
growth uh or certainly anywhere close to
optimal growth
even if you do a large number of sets
you might be so working so inefficiently
that it'll take you like
you know 40 sets per workout to get the
same hypertrophy you could get out of
like six or seven sets
if they were appropriately close to
failure so being close to failure is
important right this is concentric
failure
so we can say it's true that working
sets must be sufficiently close to
concentric failure to produce the best
adaptations
and it's probably due in some large
factor to motor unit recruitment
on average larger more powerful
faster twitch more growth prone motor
units don't
activate until they're needed to produce
the higher and higher forces
uh within each so the force and every
repetition for every rep is roughly the
same
as you start from you know your first
rep to let's say 15 reps to failure
the average force is the same as long as
the velocity is roughly the same
and you can absolutely arrange for the
average force to be the same and they
can be a little bit different
what happens is a bunch of your muscle
fibers especially the ones that have
been on for a while the slower twitch
ones
you start to tire out the rest of your
muscle tires out
everything else about maybe the uh the
central nervous system etc starts to
tire out and thus in order to keep
producing enough force to do another
repetition and another repetition
another repetition
your body has to turn on more of these
faster twitch motor units which are
usually just dormant they'll sit around
and do
a whole lot of not much now they might
actually turn on
quite early in this process way before
like five reps from failure
but they're not turned nearly maximally
enough to stimulate a ton of tension
through them
stimulate a ton of metabolite production
inside them and thus reliably cause best
hypertrophy
so these very fastest twitch motor units
which are responsible for a lot of the
growth not all of it
a lot of the growth probably turn on
much more or stimulated much more the
closer to failure you get especially in
the last five repetitions
right so anything further than five reps
out from failure
just doesn't really produce reliable
growth in the normal volume ranges that
we're used to training and we'll get to
those next but
can you stay 10 reps short of failure
and still get really good hypertrophy
yeah you probably can
you might just have to do triple or
quadruple the number of working sets
which is to say you're wasting your time
in a huge huge way right
training what about past failure do we
get hypertrophy benefits
training past failure what the hell's
how are you supposed to train past
failure well
it's actually quite easy you're doing a
machine bench press
and you fail met a hundred pounds 15
reps exactly
you put the weight down you really
quickly change to 50 pounds
then you keep going this that extends
past failure
with some kind of load reduction a
training partner can do this for you the
bench press they help drag it up a
little bit for you
training pass failure is very likely
highly effective
causes lots of growth but unfortunately
it probably causes
linearly more growth but exponentially
more fatigue
so at some point past failure probably
right after the first rep passed failure
the amount of fatigue generated relative
to the amount of
muscle growth stimulus that occurs is so
vastly different it's so much
that you're better off never really
going past failure outside of special
cases
stopping as soon as you hit failure or
even a couple reps shy of it
resting for a while and just doing
another working set just doing another
working set
still produces really good more growth
stimulus it adds to total growth
stimulus for that session
but it doesn't produce this crazy crazy
crazy amount of fatigue
right imagine that someone told you that
in order to become the best endurance
runner
you have to run until your legs
physically can't move every single
training session
yeah okay sure how far would you get if
you
ran at a pretty fast pace until your
legs couldn't move you can't get up and
keep running
i mean you're basically done and you're
probably done for a long time
several days you're getting a crazy
soreness you can accumulate so much
fatigue you won't reliably be able to
run enough kilometers
or miles per week to become the best
endurance athlete endurance athletes
figured out this out maybe hundreds of
years ago
most endurance training doesn't push
this the human being to
absolute limit pushes them close but
most endurance athletes know but to push
yourself all the way to the limit the
amount of fatigue is
is non-linearly related it exponentially
goes up
right so same idea in hypertrophy
training
going all the way past failure probably
isn't the best idea there's a great way
to grow
it's just not sustainable from a fatigue
perspective so
if we graph the relative intensity
into the overload range on the x-axis we
have how many reps in reserve you have
zero reps in reserve means you're
training a failure
two reps in reserve rir means you had
two reps in the tank when you stopped
right you're like benching you're like
we got about two
this is getting tough and rack right and
then of course
we go all the way to 10 reps in reserve
which means you stop a set
10 reps away from failure now notice
hypertrophy stimulus per set by the way
is on the x-axis just for reference so
what we're looking at is how much muscle
growth can we signal to occur per set
based on how close to failure we get
notice super important we start all the
way
to the left side bottom of the graph at
10 reps in reserve
the hypertrophy stimulus percent is not
at zero okay
for very advanced individuals in very uh
certain circumstances it could be very
close to zero or really at zero
right i think as you get more advanced
you may have to push things a little bit
closer to failure this is
very very uh and the scientific
community of hypertrophy
research were very very open-minded to
that idea possibly not true but it's
possibly true
however for many people much of the time
you don't actually have to go all the
way to failure to get some growth but
notice
the amount of growth if we sort of scale
it here maybe like one-fifth the amount
per set that you could be getting if you
went closer in failure so can you
imagine someone
stopping 10 rep shy of failure doing
five sets we could have just done one
set
close to failure and gotten the same
amount of growth i mean good god but
what a giant waste of time
that kind of training is as a matter of
fact you might experience so much
fatigue from doing those many sets
the stimulus to fatigue ratio might be
off okay you're basically like endurance
training for your growth not the best
way to do things so
ten reps shy of failure provided that
the load is above thirty percent one arm
causes you some growth but very little
growth
there's probably a roughly linear rise
all the way until we reach
about five reps in reserve and then
because this is an
s-curve shape there's probably around
five reps in reserve kind of a
sort of a knee a bend in the curve that
radically escalates the growth fraction
that we get
by going closer and closer to failure
why five rir because that's probably
when
we reach close enough to failure for a
high enough percentage of these faster
twitch larger more growth promoter units
to start to really have to turn on
more push themselves to the limit and
thus illicit growth
inside their own cellular structures
anything much less than five reps in
reserve probably doesn't do that to such
a significant extent
so if we really try to overload try to
put an overload threshold number on this
yes you can get reliable growth with
less than five rar training
but it's nowhere near optimal growth so
the overload pressure really is about
five reps in reserve
and then after that going from five reps
in reserve to four ups in reserve grows
much more muscle
which is to say the following happens if
you're used to training
and you stop all of your sets at five
reps in reserve the only thing you
change
next month after a deload is you push
all sets to four reps in reserve you're
gonna grow a lot more
significantly more on the other hand
going from four ups to reserve to three
reserve also causes a significant boost
in gains
but not as much of a boost in gains very
likely as going from five to four
same pattern from three to two yeah it's
better to go two r than 3r in your
average training session
but the gains are modest and different
so someone's training three reps in
reserve all the time
you come up to them like dude you're
really wasting your time you should do
two repertoire of training here try this
program
let me know how it feels two or three
months later they're going to say yeah i
think i grew a little bit more muscle
is that a crazy amount and they're going
to be correct going from two to one rer
is probably a very small boost one to
zero rer is such a small boost we
haven't been able to detect in the
literature
so direct studies comparing one or two
reps shy of failure and actual failure
can't really reliably come up with any
difference in hypertrophy but
theoretically there's probably good
enough
theory that all the way to failure is
probably better in one session
and of course you get probably that same
tiny little boost
going a little bit beyond failure
however remember that this is
just for hypertrophy stimulus percent
it's not for fatigue stimulus per set
which very close to after two rir starts
to go up probably in an exponential
looking
curve so as you go from five rar to two
r
stimulus and fatigue go up roughly
linearly and in fact uh stimulus might
go up even higher at that point
making two rir pretty sweet spot average
target for reps in reserve
but after you go to 2rir you start to
have more and more fatigue
probably rising faster than the stimulus
which is to say that anytime you train
between two and zero reps in reserve and
certainly a bomb
you're a little bit sort of on the clock
uh you're
you can only sort of get that optimal
output
for man maybe a couple of weeks maybe
just one week if you're talking about
training to failure or beyond failure
but anything after that
is going to be very very suboptimal
because fatigue will have accumulated
way too much
but for now we know anything between
five and zero reps in reserve
probably a pretty good representation of
the relative intensity
overload range very cool
next up the volume overload range
okay we know how heavy we have to train
roughly between 30 and 85
1rm we know it should probably be on
average pretty close to failure you know
like you don't want to do a set of 20
with your 30 rm maybe 7 25 or above it's
good
right but that's just talking about one
set
how many sets do we have to do in a
session
to be overloading right because
you know doing one set beginners will
grow from it we'll cover that in just a
little bit
but advanced individuals gee just one
set per session
might not cause a reliable amount of
hypertrophy
or certainly not an optimal hypertrophy
for example if you do
even seven sessions per week if you're a
very advanced individual
seven total sets that is if you do one
set per session
seven total sets per week may literally
not be enough to cause your best growth
or to cause much of any growth it might
just be right around your maintenance
volume at that point
so we actually have to ask the question
of
you know how many sets per session gets
us first of all reliable growth
minimally effective volume and then
later we have to ask the question of
what's the most number of sets per
session we can survive
right and somewhere between there will
be the optimal amount the maximum
adaptive volume
that is on average that the amount of
sets you do per session that cause
the best results so in technical terms
we're talking about is the distance
between the mev and the mrv if you're
familiar with our
volume landmarks literature and there's
a whole books on volume landmarks that
dr james hoffman i wrote called how much
should i train um give that a look if
you're super curious
in beginners minimum effective volumes
the fewest number of sets you have to do
reliably per session to grow
can be as low as one set absolutely per
muscle group
right so just one set of chest press and
your chest grows
very very reliably um
however the maximum recoverable volumes
how much which the most someone can do
they start out pretty low but they
quickly rise to around five to ten cents
per session
right pretty well documented there and
how about intermediates though
intermediates they're not as lucky as
beginners
right for them minimum effective volumes
are usually between two and four
sets per session right and
maximum recovery volumes are higher
because they're much more used to
training are somewhere between 10 and 15
sets per session
very curiously and very importantly
maximum adaptive volumes
which are usually expressed as an
average over a mesocycle because they do
shift and change
have been found at least by several
individuals and analyzing the data
including james krieger who's highly
recommended
something like around eight sets per
session perhaps
right um that's based on a ton of
factors though
at any one point in time at any one
mesocycle for any one individual any one
muscle group
the maximum adaptive volume can be
somewhere between three and roughly 12
sets per session
in many lifters and many times so give
that some thought it's a floating number
but okay let's take something out of
this let's graph it and see what kind of
representation we get
x-axis number of working sets per
session
y-axis hypertrophy stimulus per session
and this is just an example numbers for
medium intermediate lifter because
everyone has their own volume landmarks
we can see here though that how much
hypertrophy do we get with zero
sets per session well zero how much do
we get with one set per session like a
very very tiny amount
two sets per session we start to see an
inflection point
go up and then we get to four sets per
session we're doing
a lot of hypertrophy six sets per
session is close to optimal
right as an average weekly set number it
seems that
when this example or this graph um you
know eight sets around eight sets per
session is somewhere
at the top of the curve and then as you
get
to 9 and then 10 and then more sets per
session in this example and
the numbers don't have to be 10 sets
whatever they are 12 or 15
everyone has a point beyond which
doing more sets literally just causes
more damage
which takes resources away from muscle
growth and causes
less and less growth so it's very
possible if you stop a workout at 10
sets
you get your best muscle growth if you
stopped it at 15 like you literally just
did you're like oh yeah hardcore let's
do another five sets
every single one of those sets is
costing you muscle growth signaling
because it's imposing such a heavy toll
on your ability to grow
right and by the way this is not a
surprising relationship that there can
be
a u-shaped curve uh which at which point
there's too much of a good thing
okay this is almost exactly the same
curve with number of drinks you can have
at a party to have
fun right alcohol is not a pure fun
molecule
someone like to believe that's the case
it's actually a really similar curve so
let's look at this
alcohol analogy zero drinks how much
alcohol-induced fun are you having on
the y-axis
uh you know zero drinks zero alcohol
induced fun you could have all kinds of
different kind of fun
what about two drinks like we'll say per
session that's per evening
right in a in a party you're at a party
for five hours how many drinks right
two drinks yeah you know nothing to
write home about
you may not even feel two drinks you
feel a little bit more loose
at four drinks you're having some fun
things are going super well
you're feeling yourself at six drinks
you're having a time
and somewhere in this example between
seven and nine drinks you're just the
life of the party but as
any of us who have gone to college and
successfully survived that process know
north of nine drinks 10 drinks 11 drinks
you're probably having less fun now
you're throwing up you're rambling at
people and getting into fights you
get lost in the way to chipotle and wake
up you know
three in the morning with vomit all over
yourself oh
such fun with alcohol turns out there
may be an optimal per
session range of alcoholic drinks to
have that are super fun
and it's totally different on the person
totally different on the evening
etc etc but there is that range same
idea for muscle growth
only so many sets you can do they're
going to be beneficial after a while
there's such a thing as too much of a
good thing probably because of excessive
damage
okay so that's per session oh somewhere
between
3 and 10 sets is best for growth
depending on circumstances
again sort of an analogously large range
to our
tension range right 30 to one hundred
percent one rm
it's very very very similar so what
about
the frequency overload range one session
is overloading okay if we have an
overloading session does that mean we
have long-term muscle growth no
because can you imagine someone says hey
how much have your legs grown in the
last six months and you're like
surprisingly they didn't grow at all and
they're like well why not i thought you
were training a gap i trained
like okay um okay so what was your
training like well i did squats i did
leg presses or leg extensions
eight total sets right in range of the
maximum adaptive volume for the
literature like wow wow
that's not that's really trippy um where
is your nutrition goods leave good there
yeah it was great blah blah blah what a
mystery
like um maybe you're over trained how
many like sessions did you per week and
they're like
what a guy i mean i trained once during
that six months
what would your reaction be if someone
said that you're good hold on a second
you've got to train more than once in
this person again i didn't know that
there wasn't let's say it's a robot or
an ai just trying to learn to be human
i didn't know there was an overload
threshold for frequency well there is
right it turns out you gotta train more
than once and that's an understatement
uh it turns out that if we look at
something like a week's length of time
we can start to come to an understanding
of how many times
you know is overloading at all or not
and then how many times gets us closer
to optimal
right so we know multiple sessions have
to be done in sequence the question is
how many
right um another way to ask this is how
often
should the system be disrupted in order
to cause cumulative gains to occur
because you disrupt the system it causes
muscle gains to occur and then they
sort of deteriorate and then you
probably have to stimulate somewhere
around this area
and then more muscle gains occur and
then of course that adds up over time
but if you let the muscle gains recede
completely before hitting it again
you're just going to be training for
basically nothing right so the answer to
this
of how many sessions can we do or do we
need to do how often
is at least often enough for the
mps area under the curve muscle protein
synthesis area under the curve to be
positive net positive and it says see
frequency graph one so we're going to go
to
next slide frequency graph one what are
we looking at
if you train so on the x-axis is number
of days goes up to ten plus
on the y-axis it says muscle proteins
that's the synthesis mps
right so if you look at here we have the
training session at the origin
and muscle protein synthesis peaks looks
like in this example right around two
days and falls off to normal right
around four days
so once we get to around four days
then muscle protein synthesis actually
goes back to normal
and then because the human body normally
catalyzes muscle at some
some rate and if there's no reason to
grow any muscle that stops doing that
your body starts reverting to
homeostasis in a very slow manner
and starts to burn a little bit of
muscle a little bit of muscle a little
bit muscle over the next several days
at about 10 days ish and this is
actually pretty reliable for most people
at most times
right around a week and a half you're
probably back to about the same amount
of muscle you started if you only
trained once
10 days ago so you've sort of burned
through all of your gains
which is to say two things if you train
at least one more time
within that 10 days right you trained at
day zero healed train or completely
went back to homeostasis at day four
right
and then if you train at least once
after that
you're gonna probably get net muscle
growth okay if if that session is
above minimum effective volume at least
somewhat overloading
um reliable uh but if you train
after the 10 days let's say you train at
day 10 and then again you know day 20
and so on and so forth
there's a good chance you're going to
cause about zero net growth
on average definitely exceptions but on
average so if someone said hey if i only
train once every 12 days
am i guaranteed to grow muscle i'd be
like yeah you know if i was talking to
an intermediate
probably not you know and if someone was
like hey i'm training i can only train
the same muscle group once every six
days is that uh
good enough i'd be like yeah that's
almost certainly going to cause robust
reliable muscle growth in most people
right all right so what about the top
end right because this is at least often
enough
the overload range begins at uh
enough uh for the muscle protein
synthesis to have a positive error under
the curve which is
seriously about training once every 10
days
what about the top end right the top end
is
however many mps curves that is from
training sessions you can fit in
to say a week without fatigue preventing
the curves
uh from being generated at all so
for example if we look at frequency
graph number two
what you can do is train at day zero
let's say you recover right around day
three
train again at day three there's another
bump your your muscle growth goes back
to baseline
both sorry back to zero at day six again
and you train again and then a day nine
so on and over
now do these curves have to be
three days long absolutely not if you
train a little bit less
they're shorter so there's a way in
which many people can hit their minimum
effective volume
by training so in such a way that they
heal one or two days later
which means that many times you can
train muscles pretty close to optimally
up to six and maybe even more times per
week
but you can also do more training per
session all the way up to og you know
like eight to ten sets
still get very very awesome gains it
might take you three to four days to
recover
and then you're looking at only twice
weekly training
but still there's none of that red area
right there's no time where you're
really losing muscle
you're gaining muscle going back to
normal and re-stimulating
is it possible to restimulate muscle
growth while you're still growing it
thus summating more and more and more
muscle it is possible in the short term
through functional overreaching but
unfortunately muscles probably have
refractory periods for growth
when a muscle is in the process of
recovering from another training session
growing muscle
further stimulus probably causes much
less additive growth
so it might not be worth it it might be
worth it just sort of weight it's almost
like um
if you're trying to gain weight uh one
hour after you've eaten a really big
meal trying to eat more you might eat
almost nothing and
just delay how how long you're hungry
again for another several hours
might be worth it to just wait three
whole hours and then eat another good
hearty meal
that may be the way you get to eating as
much as possible
also fatigue dynamics if you're going to
overload so often
that you don't even let the muscles
recover during that time at some point
fatigue is going to rise so high you're
not going to sustain that training
frequency
for very long right which takes us to
the last frequency graph that we're
looking at
and the take-home message here is the
following so let's look at this graph
number of sessions per week on the
x-axis and hypertrophy stimulus per
week we look at one session per week
and this has been very well documented
in literature going from one session to
two sessions of the week is
going to grow much more muscle
significantly more muscle and this is
just an example for for an average
muscle group it's different from muscle
groups and individuals but
in almost every case that's been studied
training twice a week is better than
training once a week
okay that makes a lot of sense because
you know
that mev to mrv
hit that you're going to give to your
muscles that close to maximum adaptive
volume
3 to 12 sets per session
that's probably going to let you recover
and train again
productively you're going to be able to
overload on tension and relative
intensity and and procession volume
again
in probably about half a week right so
if you wait for an entire week you know
are you losing muscle no you're still
gaining it but
you're probably treading water for a
long time
right so if you do a really good high
quality session that checks all the
boxes
except for frequency right it's uh
overloading attention it's overlapping a
relative intensity it's overloading on
volume
it's going to take you usually at most
half a week maybe a little longer to
recover from it so that you can do
another productive session
and if you choose to and you make it two
sessions a week you're going to grow a
lot more muscle and if you choose not to
yeah you're still growing that amount of
muscle from one session a week but it's
not that much
not it's decent and you can go long term
with it but you can go faster if it's
two sessions a week
same idea happens if you add another
session and maybe even split the volume
up a little bit more
but it's not a huge increase most
studies find that three sessions per
week is better than two but already not
all
four sessions per week is usually better
than three but by a very small amount
the difference between five six and
seven sets
per week is or sorry sessions per week
is so small that most research can't
detect it
and anything higher than oh eight
sessions per week unless you get really
creative
is going to have so many sessions that
are each above their minimum effective
volume because if a session is not
it's above matter of fact volume itself
why hell are you doing it
are you just doing a bunch of warm-ups
then much more than
seven sessions per week if you really
try to cram them in
is going to cause such an accession in
weekly volume fatigue is going to
skyrocket
and all of a sudden you're not growing
as much muscle as you can
right so the frequency overload range is
right between
oh very charitably one and
seven sessions per week but seven
sessions per week is a whole lot and
it's really super unsustainable
and one is so far from optimal in most
cases that
we treat a working overload range is
something like two to six
sessions per week per muscle group and
that's going to depend on the muscle
group not all muscle groups
are able to tolerate that so
summing all of that up the overload
threshold for hypertrophy writ large
the overload threshold means that if
you're gonna get anywhere near your best
growth
your training should meet the following
rough four criteria there's plenty of
room for nuance
but not infinite nuance right at least
thirty percent one around more heavier
in most cases and up to about
eighty-five percent one rm
for a short period of time that can be
heavier than 85 percent one around but
not indefinitely
for relative intensity most of your
training should be five reps away from
failure or fewer
right or closer to failure and up to
zero reps away from failure or just
beyond it
for a very short time that is a week or
two in most cases
as long as you'll be able to sustain
that and continue to overload
number three is that per session you
should have
probably at least two to four sets in
non-beginners beginners can do one set
procession and grow
but beginners usually don't watch these
sorts of videos uh and you know nor do
they have problems growing
right it's intermediates in advance of
certificate problems growing that look
into the depth of literature to solve
those problems
two to four sets per session so if
you're doing fewer than that maybe not
doing enough
and up to ten plus sets per session for
a short time then again
if you have a reasonable frequency ten
plus working sets per session for muscle
group
is going to overreach you pretty fast
okay they mean a reasonable frequency is
let's say an average of three sessions
per week
if you do 10 plus sets for uh that are
working sets that's
a weekly volume of 30 plus working sets
uh people can sustain that beginners can
sustain that for several months
intermediate advanced people for several
weeks to a week at most
and that's just in the smaller muscles
forearms biceps side belts
try that with your quads and if you're a
relatively strong person
you might find yourself lying in a
gutter somewhere right so very
unsustainable at the very high ends
and lastly you should do at least one
session per week to be guaranteed growth
you could train a muscle every two weeks
is probably not a great idea
but best results are probably somewhere
between two and six sessions per week
and possibly even more than that for a
very short period of time
all right huge chunk of this
presentation out of the way
but we have another really serious
mythological concept
the overload threshold remember there's
the maximum ability of the system
minimum ability or zero and then all the
thresholds here somewhere anything
between these two
numbers is good because it causes growth
this bottom part
probably rises okay it's not the same
a couple related problems first
if you say okay there's this bottom
range right
i don't want to train here because the
bottom seems to rise we'll cover that in
a sec
i'm going to train at the top all the
time i'm going to what does the top mean
actually we'll just go back a slide 85
plus percent on a ram every session okay
sort of insane already to failure and
beyond every session
because already nobody trains like this
um
10 plus sets in every session
you would be dead and
seven sessions per week do not try this
at home do not try this anywhere
even in a hotel room okay so not a good
idea
so this is a real real understatement
the top end range
top end ranges are not sustainable for
long periods of time certainly not in
combination and even by themselves are
not sustainable for long periods of time
so we cannot simply say okay well who
cares if the overload range moves if
we're just at the top all the time we
always win
absolutely not you can be at the top of
it maybe once a month once every two
not repeatable however here's the
problem if we're trying to get away from
number two
the bottom end of some of the ranges
moves up over time
okay how many sets it used to take you
to grow this used to be here now it's
here
it moves slowly but it does move so we
have to have some adjustment
and here's another one because the
entire range moves up and down over time
especially up
right if we expose ourselves to any one
thing in the middle of the range
any one stimulus will produce very good
results the first time it is tried
but your body gets used to stuff and the
range moves
the second time you have a stimulus you
probably if it's the identical stimulus
you probably won't get as much out of it
the third time you'll get a little less
the fourth time a little less the fifth
time
less after a while you're getting
nothing at all this analogous to every
single experience you have
with just a little bit of nuance there
that some potentiating factors could
make the second time or the third time
even better than the first but watch
this
the first time you read that book on
eastern literature how much do you learn
a ton
how much you learn the second time a lot
but uh not as much
right certainly like some of the stuff
you read you're like ah do that do that
or that that's not new
because everything is new the first time
what about the third time you could
really like just solidifying concepts in
its review
the fourth time gee you know you just
went on a plane trip somewhere
for eight hours and you forgot all your
other books and wi-fi doesn't work
you got this eastern literature book
again you're like here we go time number
four
and it couldn't even be hard to pay
attention at that point there could be
some stainless that develops
because you're getting almost nothing
out right so
these are all problems we're going to
look at them separately but where we're
going with this
is yes there's an overall threshold and
prior to this we were basically doing
training like we're throwing darts into
that threshold as long as they hit in it
we're good
but it turns out because the threshold
moves and if we repeat the same kind of
training over and over again it's not
optimal
the overload principle actually has a
two component definition things have to
be in the overall threshold
and over time have to go up there has to
be progression
which is why there's a term called
progressive overload precisely because
of these three problems
so first problem sustainability you can
train at 85
1rm plus but you can't do that for
multiple sessions with hypertroph
with hypertrophy volumes you can do with
powerlifting volume strength training
you can't do it with hypertrophy volumes
if you get into zero rar or negative ir
you can't maintain this at normal
volumes for a very long
amount of time absolutely not not
sustainable 10 to 15 sets per session
you can do every now and again if you
work up to it but you can't do it all
the time because you're just going to
fall apart into pieces unless
you screw yourself on some of these
other values if you go gee
you know if you go 10 reps shy of
failure you can certainly do 10 to 15
cents per second but such a giant waste
of your time
very very inefficient and of course
four or more sessions for very large
muscle groups
and even six or more sessions for
smaller muscle groups
is usually not sustainable for an
infinite amount of time
a lot of times because connective tissue
doesn't heal as fast as muscular tissue
you get into situations where like your
quads might heal in time for your next
leg day but after weeks and weeks and
weeks of
five-time week quad training your knees
might not enjoy the process it's pretty
well documented
in the actual athlete population so the
implication here
is that when you start a hypertrophy
training program it's probably not a
good idea to start close to those upper
ends we got this
threshold you don't want to start a
hypertrophy training program here um
there's just nowhere to go and you sort
of self-exhaust and you have to take a
bunch of de-loads and you're resting a
whole lot and not training a whole lot
it's probably not optimal for
hypertrophy and probably not sustainable
from an injury perspective even if you
do get some muscle growth out of it
so maybe you don't want to start all the
way up here maybe you want to start
somewhere in the middle
uh or closer to the bottom of the range
let's talk about the bottom of the range
let's say you start close to the bottom
of the range you just want to sit there
for a while well here's a problem
over multiple days of training your
thirty percent wanna ram goes up
okay so if you picked a weight that was
thirty percent one of your m a couple of
days later when you do the same lift
uh you're gonna be able to do more reps
than you used to
that thirty percent one of them is no
longer a thermostat one around it might
be your 28
one rm that might be okay to stimulate
close to optimal growth but after a few
weeks it's certainly not okay because
it's close to 20 percent of your 1rm
and now you might be getting very very
suboptimal growth so if anything that 30
one arm range you have to train heavier
and heavier to stay north of it
okay in addition to that we have the
arrested reps and reserve problem
as you do the same weight if you
continue to do the same weight for the
same reps
your reps in reserve actually starts to
rise right
you do a set of 10 with 300 pounds on
the squat
week one week two you do a setup and
let's say that's
uh three reps shy of failure okay tough
next week you do 300 pounds first out of
10 in the squat
that might be like you know you're
better at squatting now there's
neurological adaptations you've grown
some muscle
you have accumulated some fitness and
now you're at
four reps in reserve or 300 pounds for
ten still hypertrophic but
less so fast forward that a couple of
weeks
and 300 pounds per set of 10 is now at
six eight reps in reserve it's not even
close to optimal hypertrophy that's a
really big problem
so we have to put either more weight on
the bar or we have to do more reps
if we're going to stay in our close to
failure range training has to be more
challenging over time
simply because we have to continue to be
at least in the reps and reserve range
anything really far away from failure is
not a super good idea
next issue on the volume front over
weeks of training your muscles
desensitize to any given training volume
and they get less and less growth out of
any given volume especially if you start
at your minimum effective volume
after multiple weeks you might actually
be if you don't change your volume at
all
below your minimum effective volume you
started out with a routine that caused
you growth in the first couple of weeks
but after a couple of weeks you're so
used to the volume that that might
actually just be a maintenance program
at that point but
you grew some muscle early in the
program but later in the program muscle
growth
has really started to stall out
and especially for beginners okay
because they adapt super quick but
everyone does this to some extent
um any given frequency becomes less
effective over the months
because as you're able to tolerate more
and more volume
you tend to heal faster between sessions
and you could have just squeezed in
another session
for example if you do two sessions per
week of quads
and uh you you do this for several
months you're gonna get really great
gains
but after a while you're gonna notice
that in the volume ranges that you're
normally doing
gee you know you figure okay train quads
monday and i train with thursday
unlike wednesdays and sundays
i'm like not sore at all i could totally
hit another quad workout like
wait a whole day you figure you know why
don't i try quads monday
wednesday and friday you try it and
there's no problem squeezing it all in
and all of a sudden you're up to three
sessions and you can actually recover
you think okay i can't do this forever
because my joints are gonna start to
hurt but
for at least a couple months i'm gonna
be able to do three sets per session
could you have still gotten gains
with two sets per or two uh sorry two
sessions per week
yes would they have been optimal
probably not
right as you get more experience than
training over months of training in any
particular style particular exercises
especially
you can add sessions per week slowly
every meza cycle or two you can add a
session per week because your body gets
used to
training and can handle its recovery
ability goes up so much
that you can probably do more sessions
and get much more benefit
remember if you do a really high number
of sessions it's a self-extinguishing
process you can't keep raising them at
some point you have to lower them back
down for everything to recover
but in the short term you can raise them
and then reload raise and reload and so
on and so forth
lastly point number three this problem
here with that leads to the idea of
progressive overload
at any given load and reps used
even if you're not at the bottom of this
range
reps in reserve starts to rise
strength rises work capacity rises so
either load or reps have to increase for
best gains
right even if you start at a challenging
volume you start at five sets per
session instead of two
right if you start with a certain weight
on the bar and certain numbers of reps
one or two of those have to go up right
and of course over the course of
multiple weeks of training
muscle growth in terms of number of sets
per session also begins to desensitize
this happens slowly but it does happen
so that if you start with something not
at your minimum effective volume let's
say you start at six sets
per session you get a certain amount of
growth out of those sets in the first
session a certain amount of growth in
the second and third fourth so on and so
forth
by you know your 10th session of the
mesocycle maybe four weeks in or
something
you're not getting nearly as much growth
out of six cents per session as you were
and somebody could ask how do we how do
we mediate that how do we remediate that
well you know you can increase intensity
relative intensity only so much
unfortunately if you go really close to
failure yeah you're causing more growth
but you're causing way more fatigue you
won't be able to keep that up
we may ask the question of like so why
don't we like every two weeks or
something
as we notice that it's just not enough
like we don't get super big pumps
anymore we hardly get sore we feel like
we're under training
maybe we should add a set here and there
instead of staying at six we could go to
seven and then we could go to eight and
we go to nine and maybe we go to ten and
then it's too much it's too much fatigue
and then we deload
that sounds like a good idea because any
time you do six sets per session once or
twice or three times
after probably three sessions of six
sets per session
seven is better eight would be better so
you have to ask yourself the question of
why am i continuing to do six sets per
session even though it was a really
awesome when i started
if i could do better if i moved up in
almost
all of the literature in volume and
hypertrophy training as far as number of
sets
shows that up into a very high point
probably around 10 sets per session
doing more sets per session causes more
muscle growth
so even if you start at a reasonable
even if you don't start all the way down
at med and if you start at mev it
clearly
you have to add more sets because
there's huge upsides to doing
if you start two sets per session
there's a big upside to doing three and
a really big upside down four so on and
so forth
even if you started something reasonable
like six at some point you know six
could coast you out for a couple of
weeks of good gains but the best gains
probably mean you have to add at least
one or two sets over the course of a
mesocycle in order to keep the best
gains up
right and of course um
you can only add so much volume per
session until
it starts to interfere with its own
design so if you add more than 10 or 15
sets per session then you get so much
damage
that it no longer makes any sense but
you can say to yourself yeah like per
session i can't do this
but i'm recovering so fast between
sessions now it might make sense to add
a session in the week
so you can start a message cycle with um
two sets per session and just by adding
reps or weight
and sets you can get optimal hypertrophy
of two sessions per week or pretty close
next message cycle though gee you may be
ready for three sessions a week again
starting at the very low end and working
my way back up
as far as sets per session are concerned
so you start four sets per session and
work your way back up
but now because you're starting at three
sets or sorry three sessions per week
you get more growth and then the next
message cycle you might be able to do
four sessions per week the meso after
that could you do five maybe but your
cumulative fatigue might be so high you
need
uh time for active rest you know two
weeks to really calm the body down
and then your body so sort of
resensitized to hypertrophy and the work
capacity and recoverability are so low
because of two weeks of easy stuff
that you may be back down to benefiting
maximally from two to three
sessions per week and not having to go
to five six seven and so on and so forth
so that takes us into our programming
recommendations
when starting a block which is multiple
meso cycles oh
right around three mesocycles of
training
you want to train very likely in
multiple zones of the 30 to 85 percent
range
which is to say some literature has
shown that if you train in the lower end
middle range and
higher under that range that you get
optimal hypertrophy may be something to
do with stimulating every kind of muscle
fiber there is
so train in multiple zones of that range
but make sure to increase weights
approximately weekly
right to keep the zones moving up with
strength gains you don't want
your 15 rep zone to turn into your 25
rep zone because then you're
ignoring the 15 rep zone right generally
speaking there's sort of three zones the
5 to 10 rep
the 10 to 20 and the 20 to 30. you want
to make sure that
for the exercises you've chosen to be in
each one of those zones in the week
that they're still in the zones you know
you don't want your strength to improve
so much that we used to do for sets 12
you now do for sets of 22 because that
literally just bumped into another zone
so it's a good idea to increase
um weights on the bar and if you can
increase weights for whatever reason you
can increase reps but the rep increases
have to be
in that range uh that they started out
in
number two you started roughly three to
five reps in reserve at the beginning of
a mesocycle
and cumulative fatigue is going to bring
you down to around zero reps in reserve
before you end each mesos if you just
try to match the last week's reps so how
does this work
you start a three to five rer and you do
like 100 pounds for sets of
average of 10. then you do one of five
pounds then you do want to
you know 110 115 120. and you keep going
up in weight
it gets harder and harder to do the same
number of reps but also your fitness
is improving so maybe it doesn't get
much harder however
your cumulative fatigue that entire time
is going to start to rise
which means at some point you're going
to have to go all the way to failure to
match the reps that you started to do
by definition you can't really do better
than that next week because next week
the fatigue is even higher you're going
to start under performing
you're then by definition under
recovered and you're probably doing more
harm than good if you keep going for
longer
good time to deload right on the volume
side
on the volume side you want to start
closer to your mev
i'm not going to say it's definitive
they have to start right at your minimum
effective volume there are some good
arguments for it there's some good
arguments against having to start right
that low
closer mev maybe two to four sets per
session per muscle group
sometimes on the high end sometimes in
the low end work up
to your maximum recoverable volume and
then deload right after which is usually
going to end up at
eight to twelve sets or so for the
average muscle group and
you work up not like okay i have to add
a set every week you work up based on
feedback
for example what kind of pumps are you
getting okay if you're getting really
good pumps you're
you're good there's probably enough
volume if you're getting barely any
pumps and you used to get good pumps
you're probably used to it's probably
time for more
soreness if you're not getting sore at
all you might be having optimal
hypertrophy but you might not be
if your performance is still good try
adding a set you might grow more
on the other hand if you're getting
wildly sore and you're not even healing
on time
adding sets is a really really bad idea
because you're clearly under recovering
and of course effort perception if you
go in there and do four sets of curls
and you're like that was the easiest
thing i've ever done in my life
it's just unlikely that that's optimal
growth okay in almost every case
so next week maybe do five sets of curls
okay that beat me up quite a bit more i
feel like i did something
probably pretty well related to
hypertrophy so auto regulate your way
up in volume or i'm not even say up auto
regulate your volume and it's
usually going to go up if you start
sufficiently low to give yourself some
expansion room
some progression lastly number four on
the frequency front
start them as with the low end of
effective frequencies so maybe like
something like two to three sessions per
week for the average muscle
and then increase frequency perhaps
every meso usually just jump one
frequency i would almost never go from
two
sessions of biceps per week to doing
four sessions of biceps per week i would
almost always just jump by one jump by
one jump by one
and then until the last mesocycle of a
block let's say if three mesocycles
is only sustainable for that motorcycle
and you could never repeat it you need
to back off after for example
three sets of oh sorry three sessions of
chest
in the first mesocycle four sessions of
chest in the second
and the last third mesocycle five
sessions of chest
which beats you up so much that there's
no way you can do five sessions of chest
and another mesocycle you just need a
break
you need active rest you need a
re-sensitization phase you need
something
so that's the way that works and
on a technical note it is absolutely the
case
to say that your adaptations really kind
of drive overload remember it's because
you're getting stronger
that you need progression right so it's
absolutely true to say when people say
well
it's the fact that you're getting better
that drives overload and not the other
way around but it also works the other
way around
so you have to drive overload sometimes
even if you feel like crap right first
benefit is functional overreach you may
already be close to overreached and if
you just listened to yourself
you would do the same weights and sets
and reps or even less
but if you push yourself mentally just a
bit further you could get a big dip
in performance and ability and if you
take a break like a deal after you get a
huge rise and you get functional
overreach
which is really really awesome in
addition to that
sometimes matching big pr's requires a
lot of motivation
so you could come into the gym and you
can you did squatted last time you
squatted
390 for an average of you know eight
reps per set and you can say yeah you
know
i i know that as i'm getting stronger
overload will reveal itself
i don't feel that great today do you
ever really feel great enough to squat
390 though it's a lot of weight it feels
terrible on your back
you might have to will yourself and go
395
for sets of eight or nine all of a
sudden you hit this huge pr
and you think gee you know i really
planned that overload
now if you try to hit it it doesn't work
and you get much weaker clearly you
haven't got strong enough to sort of
earn that overload you have to deload
back up and everything else
but when we say that adaptations drive
overload
and say that overload doesn't drive
adaptations it's both it's
overloading training makes you better
and it also makes you stronger to
deserve more overloading training to
need it
but on some occasions pretty often
especially towards the end of a
mesocycle
you have to use overload to drive
adaptations
because otherwise you're going to be too
tired or too lazy or just too mentally
weak to keep going where there is a
benefit to do that every now and again
right which is to say auto regulation
and feedback have their place
but that means they have their place
it's not at the top of the food chain
it's in balance with knowing what you
have to do and sometimes you can push
yourself in short term
and benefit to a really really high
extent
all right finally submarine implications
what do we get from all this first big
hit is that you don't have to hit
all-time pr's in every single session
for overload to be met and for muscle
growth to occur right
i'll post something on instagram like i
did this lift here and then i did this
other lift a week later and they say
like
well you didn't use more weight on this
doesn't that violate the overall
principle absolutely doesn't violate the
overall principle at all now
if i was doing that for eight months
straight and i never got stronger that
would probably start to
over violate the overload principle
because it would dip below
the threshold or it's just violating it
in the optimality perspective where i'm
not doing this to get through the range
i'm kind of just
whittling around the middle and slowly
declining right
so yes you don't have to pr all the time
however
you have to at least maintain minimum
threshold values for tension relative
intensity volume frequency to cause
growth
so people say like oh you know
overload's just a range it's not a
specific number
totally but that range is a pretty
constrained range and
you can train easier than that range and
you probably won't get
your best growth or actually any growth
and
that advice to be in the range that's
just to cause some growth
for best growth which is i suspect what
you might be after
you probably want to keep increasing
weights
to stay in those sorry three tension
ranges
right you want some weights to be in the
30 to 50 50 to 70 and 70 to 85
range corresponding to the 5 to 10 10 to
20 and 20 to 30 rep ranges
and you probably want to increase them
so they at least stay in those rep
ranges
you probably want to start at roughly
three or five reps in reserve and let
the irs fall as you match reps
and increase weights you probably want
to start around your
mev and go all the way up to your mrv
you're probably leaving something in the
tank
and it's probably a good idea to start
at the lower end of frequencies and meso
cycles and work your way back up
you don't have to turn all these dials
at once some of us can some of us can't
add
frequency like we only go to the gym
four times a week just as far as we're
ever going to get we literally can't
modulate frequency at all
that's okay at least modulate all the
other stuff you might
even be able to modulate volume at least
modulate intensity and relative
intensity
right do everything you can you don't
have to turn the dials up
all at the same time but you should at
least be turning some of them
often enough to keep the body not only
in that threshold range
but moving through it probably from its
lower end to its upper end
deloading in and repeating and repeating
and repeating so you get the best
possible results of progressive
overload uh folks thanks so much for
tuning in
next time we are going to be talking
about
range of motion what qualifies as good
range of motion
what qualifies as not good range of
motion everything in between will get
super technical
see you then
