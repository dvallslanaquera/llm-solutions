hey folks dr mike isratel here for
renaissance periodization
strength training myths number four you
must train the lifts themselves
if you're going to get better at them
let's take a look at what's on deck
today the claim itself we're talking
about exactly what's being claimed here
we're going to talk about
the benefits of specificity and they're
very difficult to overstate
then we're going to talk about other
less specific ways of improving strength
and then we're going to talk about what
the best approach is so
the claim here is kind of like look if
you want to get better at bench pressing
you got to bench press it's a must you
have to squat to get better at it and so
on and so forth no matter the lift if
you want to get good at it
people say you have to do the lift now
it sounds like a duh thing like of
course you have to but hold on a second
if that was true if it was a definitive
statement if you must do the lift to
improve it
that would sort of get us in trouble in
at least three scenarios first
you're hurt and you can't do the lift
itself but you can train the muscles of
the lift individually
so maybe your back hurts when you squat
but you can hack squat
and you can do stuff like a deadlift
which are the two component lifts that
sort of
make up squatting if that's the case is
it really true
that no amount of hack squatting no
amount of stifling and deadlifting and
making those muscles and movements
bigger and stronger
it won't improve your squat at all like
that sounds kind of unlikely
what if you don't have access to the
equipment itself to train the exact lift
for example
if you're a strong man competitor and
you don't have access to a log
for log pressing but you have access to
barbells is it really true
that like you used to log press 200
pounds when you were at a strongman gym
years ago and you had the log implement
and now you're doing overhead strict
presses with a barbell
275 for sets of five is it really true
that like your log press hasn't improved
at all like fuck i mean
if you can barbell strict press 275 for
reps
gee you know your log press is probably
higher than 200 for a max
you would think and then lastly if
training a competition lift for example
like low bar squats
isn't sustainable for you because maybe
it bothers your uh wrists your elbows
your shoulders your back
does that really mean you have no chance
of improving your low bar squat
at all no matter how much other training
you do right
are you just not going to be making
gains then it sounds suspicious because
it
definitely is now before we get into why
that's suspicious
we have to admit the obvious specificity
is a really really big deal
if you train the lift itself that's the
absolute best way to improve any lift
especially in the short term due to
technique improvements
so yes the lift is very good at growing
muscle for its own performance low bar
squatting grows all the muscles you need
to low bar squat but it's because of
that neural pattern of
exactly those forces that you need to
exert in low bar squatting
when you practice it your nervous system
rapidly
gets very good at what you're practicing
so if you have to get good at a lift
quick and just generally getting good at
a lift
practicing that lift is irreplaceable
absolutely
right and there's real world
consequences here if your program
let's say you do legs three times a week
but you want to squat as much as you can
if you only squat one of those sessions
but you do like pack squats and then
lunges
on the other ones if you took one or two
of one or both of those sessions
took out some hack squatting and lunging
and put actual squatting in there
just because that specificity effect you
almost certainly would get a higher
squat
all right so there's a big grain of
truth here and
if your program doesn't include the
specific lift you're training for
for example some of the older west side
programs didn't have deadlifts even
though they were
deadlift specificity programs you have
to have a
fucking damn good reason for not putting
it in there because it's the most
obvious way to improve what you want to
improve
like if you want to get good at
deadlifts deadlifting is absolutely
number one on your list of shit to do
you can improve your deadlift without
ever doing it but you have to have a
damn good reason a damn good structure
and you have some explaining to do
specificity is king
and the lifts are absolutely top
contenders for improving the lifts
duh now it's definitely not the same
thing
saying that the lifts are the best and
improving themselves or even
very good is not the same thing as
saying you can't improve
without doing lifts which is really what
this claim is it's an exaggeration
the lift itself is not the only way to
improve the lift as a matter of fact
there are a few
basic ways in which you can increase the
lift without doing the lift and here
they are first of all
any lifts that make the requisite
muscles bigger
by the way i'm getting so jacked you can
fucking hardly scratch my neck don't
get muscular it's annoying for the rest
of your life
if a lift is making the underlying
muscle
or muscles bigger it's probably going to
lead to better strength
for example if you are
uh squatting high bar that requires your
quads a lot
if you take your leg press and you go
from doing
sets of 10 with 315 pounds
to sets of 10 with 455 pounds
maybe in some off chance next time you
go back to squatting your squat's not
instantly higher
but within a few sessions of practicing
squats she's going to shoot through the
roof like fucking
crazy the bigger quads will
absolutely power a bigger squat and
anything that makes your quads bigger
to some extent will improve your squat
absolutely well transfer
number two any lifts that simulate
a fractional mechanical action of the
main lift
will absolutely contribute for example
squatting
is basically sort of you can think of it
as kind of a it's a one part smooth
movement but it can be broken down into
two sub-components
one is the extension of the legs and the
other is the cantilevering
of the torso back to its upright
position because any squat you're going
to bend over a little bit
so if you lever your torso back up and
you extend your legs that's a successful
squat so here's the deal
if you're squatting certain loads and
you take some time away from squatting
or you continue squatting just for that
neural refinement but you don't go heavy
at all just technique work
and during that time you take your hack
squat or
your leg press and you increase it by 20
and you take your good morning or stiff
like a deadlift and you increase that by
20
so we get the leg extension movement and
the torso extension movement
of course your fucking squat is going to
go up that's crazy
you'll be baffling if it didn't and
sometimes in rare cases it doesn't right
away
because the neural learning is all off
but as soon as you start squatting
relatively heavy again
your squat just goes whoop like that
super quick because the underlying
movement patterns have been made so much
stronger right
and lastly and much more obviously
any lifts that come very close to
replicating the exact competition lift
or specific lift
pattern that you're doing do a damn good
job of increasing
for example the ultimate example here is
if you don't do low bar squats or arch
back
super attracted benches but you spend
months doing high bar squats and you get
a lot stronger
and flat back benches your bench and
squat
low bar and competition style bench will
absolutely go up and again
small chance that they don't go up right
away but as soon as you start practicing
again
they exponentially accelerate into crazy
gains because the underlying muscle
strength
and really similar motor patterns are
all there so if you say like dude you
got a bench
to get a bigger bench that's actually
just not true through at least
three of these ways now what is the best
approach in the end
because we don't want to do extremes we
want to have a decent approach
that is sort of sustainable uses the
lifts we want but maybe doesn't use them
all the time so here's the deal when
you're training for hypertrophy
we're talking about specifically in
strength let's say power lifting here
when you're doing the hypertrophy
phase for powerlifting you should use
the lifts that best transfer to the
competition lifts
but that also have the best stimulus to
fatigue ratio
for hypertrophy of those muscles that
you're going to use in the competition
lifts and it can be the competition
lifts themselves
but it may very well be and often are
very close derivatives that are more
conducive to hypertrophy training things
like stiff-legged deadlifts a bit more
of a target on the hamstrings
deficit deadlifts close grip benches
front squats and so on and so forth
those will probably form the core of
your program because they're related
enough to the competition lifts that
they increase them a bunch
but also they're so conducive to being
used in a hypertrophy set in red
paradigm
they don't irritate the joints much they
target specific subsections of muscle
that they really are the best to use for
hypertrophy now
when you're training for basic strength
a lot of
the the lifts that you're going to use
or all of them are the ones that
transfer best
to the competition lifts for sure maybe
the competition lifts themselves and it
often
is but if you can't do the competition
lifts
you're going to want to do the next best
thing and that's okay because it still
works really well not ideally but really
well
so for example if your shoulders can't
take low bar squatting
you can high bar squat your entire
strength cycle and almost certainly your
low bar squat will still go up not as
much as it could have
but a ton when you're training for
peaking
the comp lifts should be included as
much as possible because at that point
it's a neural learning thing
you're going to be competing with the
competition lifts you've got to train
the competition lifts
low bar squats competition benches
whatever kind of competition deadlift
setup you do
that's what you have to be training a
lot now if you're too messed up to train
them heavy
if you can't do heavy low bar squats you
can do heavy high bar do heavy high bar
but
if you can at least train the
competition lifts
light so that you can get the movement
pattern going look ideally you would get
the movement pattern
and the exposure to heavy weight but if
you can just get one or the other that's
good to go
so if you really can't low bar heavy
anymore for some injury reason or
something else
what you can do is heavy high bar and
have that be your heavy work but on the
lighter
technique sessions in your week and even
sometimes after the high bar work is
done
a couple of sets of as heavy as you can
go safely sustainably in low bar
so that you get the high force
production from high bar squats
and you get the technique adaptation for
mubarak does that
compare favorably to doing your actual
main work in low bar squats
no it's probably not as good but it's
still way better than zero and it will
make you stronger
folks thank you for tuning in see you
