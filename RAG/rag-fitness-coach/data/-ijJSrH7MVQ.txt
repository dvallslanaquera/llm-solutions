I started working out when I was 12
years old because you got beat up a lot
right exactly man I got to tell you
bullying is a big reason why a lot of
people lift weights something I'd know
nothing about personally children
laughed at me and they laughed and they
laughed and they laughed and what did I
do only something a normal kid would do
I ran to the bathroom crying I sat on
the toilet crying I was there for 2
hours crying and there I plotted my
Ascent to be a jiujitsu killer super
bodybuilder psycho weirdo with a weird
ch head that still knows where all of
his classmates that laughed at him live
and that they have such beautiful
families now don't they do I have pent
up issues yes
