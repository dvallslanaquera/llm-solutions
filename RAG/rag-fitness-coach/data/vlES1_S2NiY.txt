up
three singles and you're done one at a
time slow we only count the good ones
mark
[Music]
folks
I'm Dr Mike this is my biological son
and
RP expert physique coach ifbb pro Jared
feather and boys he looking large but
I'm the only loneliest non-pro here
today because Mr Mark lobliner here is
an ifbb professional bodybuilder in the
212 Division and he's the man and I
actually watched him get his Pro card I
watched him do a lot of things actually
over the years but don't tell him he's
here to do a leg workout I'm gonna be
instructing in the back again I'm not
tough enough to jump in with these guys
but Mr Jared feather will take the the
team full ROM Steed and see if Mr Mark
loebliner can keep up we're only going
to do one machine today and that is the
Matt winning belt squat we're gonna do
some stiff-legged deadlifts with it and
then we're gonna do some ouch my rep
match squats what does that mean we'll
find out shortly won't wait
I asked you a question Jared oh
you are like a father-son dude
oh 100 he's such a piece of just
wait until I get into my you better win
States goddammit you have a home here
son all right we're we're just having a
family squabble belt squat you can do
squats on it which we will shortly but
Mr Jared feather here is going to
replace he's gonna turn the belt squat
into a stiff-legged deadlift machine all
you do is unclip the Carabiner and then
you clip that right in there just like
him fat ass down don't turn it up there
you go that's it boom and now we have a
setup to do stuff like a deadlift and as
the gentleman warm up I'm gonna talk you
guys through some technique stuff we'll
do a few sets here did you want to get
in the show below here because I don't
really want my caps next to his that's
awesome I'll stand over there and you'll
look Mike Matarazzo had a child
[Music]
I want your back to be a like
this in your lower back exactly all the
way down when you feel yourself flexing
don't do it resist chest up chest up and
as you stay up right you're gonna feel
your hands get really
your Chastity's back
there it is
[Music]
oh
one more chest up chest up chest up
chest up chest up
[Applause]
so good the rules of a stiff like a
deadlift are the same
fundamentally whether using dumbbells
barbells or machines
you want the bar close to you
you want your lordotic spine
this is not an athletic position it is a
lifting position the only reason that we
turn our spine lordotic arched is
because we're pre-tilting anteriorly the
bad way our pelvis why because posterior
tilt it shortens the hamstrings anterior
tilt lengthens them we want them
pre-lengthened so they are the limiting
factor so that as you go down they pull
apart
and that insane tension at the stretch
is what provides hypertrophy in order to
keep this lower back arch you want your
tummy out and you want your chest up the
whole time so it's actually a good idea
to look forward and you're thinking of
taking your butthole and showing it to
the ceiling like this you're sitting
back and down at the same time big chest
you're going to get nice and low your
knees are going to want to come forward
don't let them push them back gently not
like this that would be a bad idea just
here and as you go down you're going to
feel an insane painful tension in your
hands that's how you know you're doing
it right yes
one more
chest
knees back yes there you go
oh yeah
it's definitely a learning curve to
getting into that form for sure for sure
small big chest big chest big chest yep
up beautiful another one perfect
slow
leave the chest on the way up to you
when you're done
deeper your chest and up yeah
do they grow they're huge oh good thank
God they're too big really I should
really just retire at this point some
people will shake a lot when they're
getting close to uh that repetition
being very very proximal to failure
and there are a couple of hypothesis as
to why it happens
but one of the reasons they think a
shake happens
is when you are trying to gain a
leverage advantage
some destabilization can basically shake
you into a better position for example
if you're dead lifting and you're right
at your knees if you just stably crank
on it it might just stop
if your body's shaking it might get it
just over your knees and then you can
crank out the rest if you ever notice
someone especially untrained doing
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu wrestling for the
first time someone fighting for their
life like an animal or a human
they'll do this at the very tip of where
they're getting choked out or whatever
and that's to destabilize the opponent
and wiggle out or wiggle through so when
you're pushing a muscle hard enough the
body goes into fight or flight mode and
goes okay start wiggling so we can
wiggle the out of the situation
that's really about the best idea that
anyone's had so much feel that yeah and
up good butt back and chest up at the
same time slow
chest chest chest and up
[Music]
here
[Music]
this goes away and we now convert
into a belt squat
while the guys are resting let me guys
give a master class email no no wait
master class that's it on the Belt squat
you guys will notice we have a lot of
plates or a lot of mats here my wife is
four foot eleven I am five foot six on a
good day
and we want the highest forces
to be closer to the bottom of the lift
if we stood on this thing we would
neither get full range of motion without
these extra plates
also the weight would be leveraged the
lowest at the bottom and the highest at
the top which is backwards you want a
deep stretch at the bottom you're going
to stand wherever is comfy basically
over the device you're going to want to
make sure you're not falling forward or
backward too much
and then
here's the big deal
your number
one priority
is to keep the heels and toes on the
ground at all times
your number two priority is to allow
your need to travel as far over your
toes as possible on the way down that
gives you maximum quad stretch and
utilization priority number last
priority three is to make sure you sink
all the way down to the bottom and sit
there for about a second and then come
up and the fourth rule is go down slow
these things can you really lean into
them yes I wouldn't just use them for
stability if you can't get out of the
bottom of one rep you can pull yourself
up and save your life I wouldn't pull
all the time this first of all you're
not here to train arms
or lats you're here to train your legs
just for stability so here's what we're
going to do I'm going to get a good
stance it doesn't matter much matter if
it's wide or narrow you can't take too
near of a stance because you clip your
dick right off your body but if you're
female I guess you're good to go JK
these things are going to Robin's gonna
be annoying so a little bit wider her
stance toast pointed out watch what I do
I sink in oh sorry last thing
my back is gonna round
typically in a squat that's bad because
there are forces going through your
spine in barbell squat in this there are
no forces that just don't go through the
whole hip so the back is entirely out of
the equation you can 100 round your back
you don't have to have chest up all the
other cues it's just the lower half of
your body so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go down really slow
this is the actual Pace we want in real
training notice how deep I am heels down
toes down
Ultra deep sit for one second
come up
slow letting the knees slide real far
forward pause
up
slope controlled knees forward
pause
and up
a nearly ideal thing to do on here is
Maya wrap if you do mine wraps in a
squat with a squat bar having to hold
the bar on your back tires you out so
much you're just gonna gas right out
you're gonna get 12 and you're gonna get
three and you're gonna get zero
with this thing because it's just the
belt you can always come up and rest
here for a few seconds and then Reagan
go back down you're going to watch as we
do these sets the guys will do a few
reps rest for a bit do a few reps rest
for a bit brutality
foreign
[Music]
oh yeah
one more
slow
[Music]
big moves
one two three rest a bit
two left
oh up up up
two times failure
good stuff my p25 will be good I think
yeah
absolutely yeah
[Music]
negative two that was negative
I've been going like seven to ten range
for most of my
heavy compound yeah yeah Matt range
yeah
sit back
slowly slowly wait
heels up good again down
go go go go go slow slow control
up two more
go go go go go nobody said rust slow
up one more again slow
wait stay tense
 wrong
that was fun
another Shake okay that was my my taint
shaking look at this Scott
can you get that can you turn around
your hamstrings of veins running across
the is up with that am I in a good
light yes there's only good light there
yeah it is good lighting Jared what you
up to baby
[Music]
hey why don't you come control it over
here while doing these belt spots
just go close to failure
rest breathe
one
[Music]
up up up rest breathe nice long time one
last one left
power go go rack beautiful holy
thank you
oh yeah oh yeah
let's see if we can get a total of about
15 reps here all added up together I
think you got it here's the thing really
quick your Technique from here to here
is excellent
your Technique from here to here is very
good
what I want you to focus on is when you
get to here it's going to suck dick
go slow and then pause okay if you go
from here to here quick you're missing
out on the best part of the movement
okay control it it's gonna make it every
tip I give you is the opposite of
strength training it's going to make it
harder not even put your life harder
don't you I love harder heels heels yes
one again
slow
heels up
last one coming up take your time I want
you to sit back on your heels deep and
sit there for two whole seconds
begin

[Applause]
my man quickly get yourself out

Mark when's the first time you realize
that men could just be beautiful and you
just want to look at them
I know
so so from an actual serious standpoint
the human body is miraculous isn't that
great the first time
the first time I saw Flex magazine I was
15 years old with Dorian Yates on the
cover and I saw the hamstring greeniness
he had some weird and for me that
was when I'm like the human body is
capable of amazing things that's when I
decided that this weightlifting thing is
something I'm really interested in yeah
no that's a good answer Jared how does
that work out for you
Jared has asthma
so proving that he is my Jewish
biological son too fast for sure three
Jews
[Music]
more or less three Jews walk into a gym
what happens that's about never happened
before
my back anyway
it's been a huge pleasure having thanks
amazing oh yeah absolutely whatever
Jared is guys make some stunts out of
