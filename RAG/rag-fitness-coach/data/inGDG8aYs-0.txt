hello
folks if you can hear me say all is well
or audio is good if you can't hear me we
have serious problems
and we'll never be back again
oh
oh yeah
the background is
um
youtube asked us to verify and all this
crazy shit last minute
oh audio's good we're good to go all
right
boom
boom
okay
crisis averted
we're good to go we did it all right
folks
youtube says now would be a good time to
insert ads
oh like we talk about stuff that you buy
or whatever yeah yeah yeah buy stuff
right now i don't care what ice cream
truck drives by your house
i'd shoot out the tires first and then
buy stuff
in any case why don't i just shut up and
answer your questions thanks dr mike
great idea
scott the video guy what do you say
start with the super chat people
yes sir okie dokie
okey dokey uh all right it says top chat
and i click on
the top chat yes
all right
william
parchiac i think
asks for barbell rows if protracting
allows you to stretch all the way
to bringing slash resting the bar on the
floor does it make a difference compared
to an unsupported loaded stretch
of the same distance
attracting allows you to stretch all the
way running the rest of the bar on the
floor
uh i see you know it depends on how much
rest you have on the floor if it's
enough rest to completely unload the
motion and there's no longer tension
being transmitted through your back
musculature yes it's not as good but if
there's just the same or almost the same
amount of tension and just enough to
touch the ground and feel that it's
there but not unload the bar then it's
pretty close to identical and the good
news about
that
form of rowing is that by touching the
ground every time and still feeling the
load you get the standardization of the
distance and in addition to that you get
the full stretch
so it's all winners
front to back so that's that's my
preferred method of doing the world the
second best method of rolling would be
the full super deep stretch without
touching because the deep stretch is
important and the third best method of
rolling would be when you just kind of
row and um you know
touch the ground and unload which isn't
terrible but not the best
all right
next up
viper one six one five seven eight five
six seven five three and nine
scott does anyone actually know the
numbers to that song
867539 i wasn't born in 1969 so i don't
know that in any case
he asks hey doc i'm going to get surgery
soon and as a result will be bedridden
that is a morbid way to put that but
nonetheless accurate
how long to regain lost muscle when i'm
healed
i have two years experience
viper i would love to help you out
but you omitted a great ultra important
detail here
the detail is this
i want to know how long you will be
bedridden for
because how long your bed ridden for is
roughly the amount of time it's going to
take to regain your muscle
until you reach about a month of being
bedridden and then you can actually
regain your muscle a little bit faster
than how long your bed ridden for so if
you're bedridden for like six weeks it
might only take you about a month to
regain all the lost muscle if you're
bedridden for like eight weeks you might
be able to get rid of or get rid of
regain all the lost muscle in something
like five or six and so on and so on and
so on because your muscle loss tends to
decline
there is another thing if you're
bedridden and you're doing some upper
body exercises and moving around to the
extent that you're able and maybe even
doing there are some exercises you can
do in bed like if you've had abdominal
surgery you can do some leg lifts and
move around may be able to stave off
muscle loss to a significant extent so
there is that what i will say to you is
this
once you are back to training make sure
to ease back into training because the
very minimum tiny tiny little uh
stimulus is going to be superlative for
you and crazy's gonna make you
psychosource don't overdo it because if
you overdo it remember your joints and
connective tissues are not gonna be as
strong as they were before and your
muscles will grow back faster so you can
get into a situation where you're like
three weeks into training you're like
eating barbells and shit like that and
sure that's not good for your health
either but on a serious note
ease in
let the easy work happen
as long as you're getting pumps and
getting sore you're regrowing muscle
like fucking wild
so if you're like oh i only did one set
i got crazy pump and then i got sore for
two days what's wrong nothing it's the
rightest thing in the world that's like
when you started training again ease in
and only do as much as it takes to get
good disruptions which will be very
little slowly slowly deload slowly
deload then at some point you're just
gonna get
all your shit back here's another thing
unless you're like 67 years old and get
some kind of crazy disease after you get
out of the bedroom stuff or if the
surgery severely impinges on your
ability to perform
you are going to get all of your gains
back within a very steady rate and then
you're going to get new gains so don't
you get depressed or upset any amount of
time because this is going to be a thing
if you're bedridden for some time you're
finally going to stand up and they're
going to say hey you can't stay at the
hospital anymore sir we've run out of
jello to feed you
you're gonna look at your body in the
mirror and go holding fucking shit
i remember when i broke my arm once when
i was 13 well once when i was seven and
then again when i was 13 you know every
few years i like to
break the old left wrist
the right wrist i can never break you
feel me
i looked at my hand when they cut the
cast off and i was like this is like
what an alien's hand looks like because
it was skinny as fuck like i could
almost see my bone and i was like oh my
god and then like a few weeks later it
was like nothing ever happened right
it's gonna freak you the fuck out when
you get off of the hospital shit
you will build back better bigger
stronger faster and dare i say meaner
maybe not meaner
don't you worry about a thing
ease back in and during the time that
you are in recovery just eat plenty of
healthy foods have a few snacks don't
gain weight don't lose weight stay
roughly the same or eat to hunger and
high protein healthy foods when you
get back into the mix of things
just make sure that you are eating very
well and not stuffing yourself but not
starving yourself and your body weight
will naturally climb back up to
basically close to where it used to be
once everything is going normal and
everything's back to normal you resume
normal training as if it never happened
best of luck to you sir i hope it all
goes really well
all right jared feathers in the talk
in the chat talking shit i don't give a
fuck who the fuck is jared feather these
motherfuckers come up with their own
names now huh
okay
mike
fucking talon you know what i'm saying
jacob beak i can do all kinds of fake
bird names fucker all right
here we go
another question
super chat
from conor mcgregor was never my friend
huh
i don't think he was anyone's friend to
be honest
conor mcgregor asks
i undertrained my arms for years and now
my backslash slash legs and shoulders
are all noticeably bigger than my buys
and tries in comparison my back double
bicep looks horrendous any advice on
bringing this up yes
for the next several months try this
for all of your chest and tricep work if
you do it together and all of your back
and bicep work if you do it together
do
well you work into this with lower set
numbers but
two sets of triceps before you do the
rest of the compound pushing for chest
keep chest at maintenance just like four
or five sets per workout that's it
for biceps do two bicep curling
movements
first
then two back movements
train like that and really emphasize
how good your technique is on the tricep
and bicep shit
and how much stronger you're getting for
reps over time
and your chest and back will not get
smaller because they're already big and
it's super easy to maintain muscle size
when it's already big especially with
the work you do after back or after your
biceps and after your triceps stuff
your arms will get bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger don't overdo it always
heal with soreness and always make sure
your performance improves deal it when
you need to that sort of structure is
going to put you on your way to much
bigger arms
hopefully that works out thank you so
much for your
payment
donation
i don't know
all right
another one
it's got the video guy sir
okeydoke
michael venables gave us an
nok 1 000
[Music]
units of money i don't know what
denomination that is but hopefully it's
a one-to-one conversion with a dollar so
i can finally buy that little tiny part
of the rim on a lamborghini that
probably costs a thousand dollars in any
case
oh uh michael says keep doing the good
work
prayer emoji
i'm on track to compete due to
everything i learned from rp
unbelievable i wish i could answer a
question for you
um best of luck competing remember that
if backstage you do this to the
competitors and shank them a bunch um
that's one less competitor you have to
fuck with
unless you shake them in a very specific
way and it gets them leaner especially
in the abs then you just fucked yourself
seriously best of luck
all right next up timothy aldridge
oh it just says welcome to exclusive
video content what the fuck
did timothy say that scott the video guy
fuck fine oh timothy if you said welcome
to exclusive video content you were
correct
if that's just something the thing says
cause it wants me to welcome members or
something then what up big homie what's
up pimp limp mike there's a right scroll
arrow and those are the people that
donated first slash
oh why wouldn't it do it backwards
all right let me get to those people
first
all right no worries first time folks
sorry bear with us brian harvey who's
been a member for five months
says when is it best to include my rep
matches versus mile rep sets
you know what
my rep matches
because let's say you do 15 reps total
15 reps with some maya reps another 15
reps with even more meyer ups as you get
fatigued
because we generally add one my rep
match set at a time
my rep match is better than maya reps
when two things are the case one the
muscle is a huge huge recovery super low
fatigue muscle to take can just take a
ton of volume and beating
and two
when a muscle
increases its recovery ability and work
capacity so fast work out to work out to
work you guys ever have a muscle where
you're like you do two sets for or
whatever skull crushers and triceps get
sore as fuck then the next workout you
do two sets again and they still get
sore as fuck and you're like am i never
gonna go up to three and like towards
the end of your measure you go up to
three sets but maybe you have a
situation with side delts like two sets
fucks them up in the first workout and
then after that with side delts you're
you like do three sets it's like barely
any pump and you're like what the fuck
and you end up doing six sets and now
you're starting to feel it you're like
holy shit what am i gonna do 20 sets the
next workout ah which you could do 20
approaches to failure that's where my
rep match is a really good idea my rep
match allows you to just slam the volume
and slam the volume and slam the volume
so my reps are really good for a lot of
kind of training but my rep match is
specifically the kind of my rep training
that allows you to really get a muscle
that needs a shit load of volume and
needs a lot of volume scaling a lot of
volume addition work out to work out to
work out because it just adapts really
quickly so
that is my answer for that all right
click in the arrows and e edward smith
thank you for your payment donation how
do people say that
scott is it payment or super thank you
for your super chat that doesn't seem
right
dr mike question on weight loss january
1st i was 345 kilos i'm going to pretend
it's kilos isn't that fun
3 45 now
233 wow amazing
uh
weight loss slowed that's good that's
why you're not dead
i consumed 2 200 calories 205 grams of
protein 250 grams of carbs 50 grams of
fat
walk five plus miles daily lift three x
weekly suggestions oh my god i have the
best gesture in the world
for the next four to six months
i want you to go on a maintenance phase
that's when you take that 233
you start eating a little bit more
normal food and let it go up to 240. do
not freak out you can control this i
promise it's not like 2 40 in the next
day 340.
get up to 240 and hang around 240 and
you'll notice that as you reduce your
cardio a bit less you can still walk
five miles plus but maybe like walk
three miles plus every day instead of
five miles plus
and eat a little bit more healthy food
every other week every week and if your
body weight starts to trend above 240
bring the food down a little bit or ease
up on the cheat meals or something have
a bit of cheat food
mostly healthy food and over the four to
six months of your maintenance phase how
much healthy food you're eating is
probably going to rise
that's going to heal the living fuck out
of your metabolism so to speak it's
going to reduce your diet fatigue it's
going to mentally make you much more
prepared to diet in the future it's
going to clear the path right right now
you're like a plane that just flew like
a crazy trans-pacific flight and it's
out of fuel one of the landing gears is
broken we never tell the people in the
back that shit
and it needs a fucking it needs a little
love a little tlc and that's going to
take four to six months after that four
to six month period
what is that like in next january
you can start another three to four
month fat loss phase where you go from
240
down to maybe like 220.
you do another
two to three month maintenance phase and
then maybe go down to 210 and so on and
so forth but i'd say you know depending
on how tall you are you know you could
like stand to do a massing phase
somewhere in there and get back up to
230 or 240 and be fucking jacked and all
that stuff
if you need some insight on the process
i would consume as much content by ethan
suplee as possible because instead of
starting at 345 he started at like 5 30
and did a lot of the wrong stuff but
then he's finally in that groove of fat
loss phases and maintenance phases give
that some thought edward thank you so
much for uh for your question that's
really good
all right
next up is
sylvan
sanesty
well
mike just doesn't sound like a cool name
anymore sylvan so sylvain amazing
sylvain asks how different heads of
muscle are related
hip extension and knee flexion are two
different functions of the hamstring but
when my hamstrings are sore because of
sldl i can't do well on curls yes
because the sldl
trains the whole fucking thing
and the heads of the muscle that are
responsible for hip extension when your
knee is stable and also knee flexion are
largely the same
the thing about muscle heads
is
people sometimes make a big deal out of
the different kinds of muscle heads and
long head short head this and that
but almost in every exercise except for
some funky ones you get a ton of
cross-contamination which is why you
should absolutely be doing some exercise
to bias various heads or others when
there's a specific different attachment
or something like that so for example
you should be doing some leg curling as
well as some hip hinging you should be
potentially doing some overhead tricep
work although technically lat pull downs
and pull ups hit that just fine for the
long head
but just remember that oh the overall
muscle is trained like 80 to 90 no
matter what situation you arrange the
various heads in so don't overthink the
stuff too much and just hit the shit if
it gets sore move on and hit it again
hit the muscle from just a few one or
two different angles every week and
you're good to go
all right next up i hit the blue arrow
i'm a fucking idiot you guys
all right
um all right
james martin sounds like a
like a famous person
all right like like dean martin yeah see
do you guys ever wish you lived in the
1920s and you could you could wear a
flapper dress wait a minute wrong gender
all right
james martin asks during the final week
in a meso attempting to achieve some
functional overreach with sets in my
compounds what would be a good strategy
to employ for consolidation of stressors
without overdoing it
you know
james there's lots of different ways to
take this
my preferred approach
is let the automatic increases in volume
and relative effort just take you where
you're supposed to go
i wouldn't change much in that last week
you know jared and charlie and i back in
the day especially jared and i
we used to do all kinds of funky stuff
at the in the peak in the last little
bit
and at some point we realized that just
so like for example
you're supposed to do five sets of leg
press or let's say last week week four
you did five sets of leg press
but due to the auto regulation you're
programmed
to do six sets of leg press in the peak
week but you get finicky and i've always
done this one like i don't know maybe
you could do something fancy and do you
know like three sets but then drop sets
or something
it turns out probably the best thing to
do is just take the auto regulation
right to the face it says do six sets
you did 400 pounds last time now it's
405
just six sets of 405 match reps or beat
reps that's it that will toast you alone
in a in a way that gives us two things
one it's for sure and overload because
we know there's no fancy shit to signal
to noise ratio this bullshit we know
it's fucking working it's more than last
time
and two because you're sticking to the
plan there's no chance that you're gonna
do some weird shit that'll get you hurt
or something like that or just not be
effective so i would just say james just
stick to the fucking basics and go one
up i know it's fucking bullshit i wish
it was some fancy shit to do
but um really you just keep going
on that straight and narrow that's my
guidance counselor i said in high school
i was gonna say now he's no longer with
us but i suppose that's a real person
who could see this live
and uh complain
all right
daveyboy77
i assume there were 76 other davey boys
which were not to specification
i'm the 77th navy boy
humanity
be warned
and in order for that warning
to be fully comprehended we're just
going to answer your question davey boy
stay calm
if you wanted to lose weight
at a 500 to 1000 deficit it did nothing
to avert muscle loss what percentage of
muscle to fat ratio could you expect to
lose
worst case scenario
the worst case scenario
is if you're on a shitload of gear and
you're ultra lean and you're eating a
ton of food and you
take that deficit to the face and you
stop weight training you come off all
steroids and then what ends up happening
is the ratio is actually negative
because you will gain fat while losing
weight while losing even more muscle
than the fat that you gained
even more muscle in the weight that you
lost
that would be the worst case scenario
unlikely we usually see in studies where
they under feed people these are not so
ethical anymore they did a lot of them
back in the day
where um on average humans seem to lose
like roughly even amounts of fat and
muscle as they die it down
for a while it'll be more fat than
muscle
once they get to a point where they drop
significantly below 10 fat it starts to
be like 50 50
which is why people don't increase in
their body fat levels as they get
skinnier and skinnier and they actually
get leaner but they cost you a lot of
muscle at that point so
yeah that would be worse worst case in
most cases is 50 50. that fucking blows
can you imagine losing 20 pounds or i
lost 10 pounds of muscle we
you know that would suck
all right
all right
srk manual youtube tells me to welcome
you for some reason because you are a
member
yeah if you guys want to become members
we do this kind of uh similar chat with
members only like
gee
kind of like
a few times a month with myself and
jared myself and james and if you really
want to go the distance just join team
full rom just google it team full rom
and there's a website you can join and
for 30 bucks a month you get workouts
what else do you get
training
customized by myself and jared and
infinity q a all the fucking time in the
facebook group and ask you can tag
charlie and jared and i we answer your
questions like i answer at least five
questions every single day just through
type i personally host a live every
single week where i answer all questions
and you can type them out you don't have
to make the live you type them out a day
before and i answer them with full
everything and then you can re-watch the
live and get all the answers he needs 30
bucks a month you know that's how much
it costs to
fuel up a tenth of a lamborghini or
something
all right elad alice
says yo
can we not do an a b push pull leg split
can we do the exact same push pull leg
workout
good question
so the principle and play here is
variation and it turns out that if you
do the same thing three days in a row
and then the same thing in another three
days the first workout is significantly
more effective than the second
buy a notable margin
if you continue to do that for weeks and
weeks this degrades in effectiveness
so we want some variation just to keep
the effects roughly the same so it's
effective effective effective and the
degradation occurs over weeks instead of
over days
but the bigger problem is psychological
stainless as well as injury proclivity
let's say you're doing skull crushers on
one of the push days push day one and
afterwards you feel a little bullshit in
your elbow i think it's fine you get
sore but it's still a little bullshit
you get into thursday of that week next
push day
if you're doing push downs and dips
different exercises they're not going to
irritate very likely that same area in
the same way and you'll very likely heal
so that next monday when you do skull
crushers again it feels like a million
bucks
but if you do skull crusher and then
skull crusher and then skull crusher and
then skull crusher that little tiny ding
becomes a really serious
thing
we're fucking rhyming out here daddy
michael who sent the thousand and okay
that's a decent amount of money so is
that decent amount of money michael if i
have to come over to wherever where's
nokia where's that
is that north korean currency or some
shit norwegian yo yo pause okay pause
hold up michael holy fucking shit okay
um
let me finish answering this question
and i'll get back to that shit first of
all thank you so much for the obscene
amount of money but here's the deal that
consistently hitting the same movements
over and over especially if it's the
same loading ranges no bueno because
it'll psychologically just gas you the
fuck out you're like fuck the skull
crushers again i'm out of here
and it can potentially injure you in a
way that just keeps fucking you up
bad deal okay
so
instead of that situation we want at
least some loading variation so if you
insist on doing the same exercises in
the same arrangement i would at least do
you know sets of five to ten in the
first part of the week sets of 10 to 15
in the second part of the week
if you want to do another layer
variation recommended i would take the
same exercises but flip the order around
to some extent close grip bench first
calls after on one day skulls first with
a heavier load close grip bench second
with a lighter load than usual on the
second day and then even better is using
completely or mostly different exercises
as well as
the variations in
exercise order and unloading and then
you got it made
i hope i answered that okay all right
all right
sir
mr norway
i assume you're the best person in
norway my wife and i just started
watching
uh
ragnarok which you guys don't pronounce
like that you pronounce it way cooler
but i'm learning tons of it's a it's a
you guys should check it out it's on
netflix so it's essentially free and
it's a bunch of just regular i'm
starting to describe it now it seems
fucking lame but it's sweet it's like
high school students in a small town in
norway ed
and um
they are all some of them are like
reincarnated norse gods like one kid is
thor and then the giants are these rich
people and they're polluting the factory
i think a bit of sjwee bullshit there
it's not that great you know like i
don't watch shows with the crazy super
conservative stuff either i like to keep
my shit pretty apolitical but it's it's
awesome and the names oh the names and
the accents beautiful i want to go to
fucking norway there's this one girl her
name is uh isolde i mean there's reason
i have any my name's mike my name
fucking sucks and thor
and fucking vidar and um oh there was a
dog named trim
unbelievable anyway thank you so much
norway's the shit if you ever come to
america sorry to disappoint don't come
to detroit that's where i'm from
all right
[Music]
asks i am three weeks into post-show
rebound my first show ever
congratulations i won my class at 53
years old holy shit at 53 i'll almost
certainly be dead so you're way ahead of
me
advice on how to keep
a good mindset as weight comes back i
was almost 250 pounds in july 2020
show i was at 202 today i'm at 213. yo
so first of all you are treating your
rebound really well
and when i did this sort of thing live
my last show you i'm saying i was on
stage at the um night show at 217 to 16
to 217 pounds i actually walked back
from the night show and got on a scale
and i looked at the scale and i was like
fuck
i was dry as shit but like holy fuck
and then three days later in the evening
i was 255 and i was feeling awful
so
your mindset seems to be already pretty
sweet and here i'll say this for the
mindset
it's about that middle path
don't eat 50 trillion oreos which you
seem to not be doing
and blow up like crazy and feel sad
about yourself and have swollen ankles
and all the shit i did
minus the sad feeling i love the swollen
ankles
also don't be like oh i 202 i'm my
leanest i'm gonna gain
over the course of five weeks i'm gonna
gain up to two or three and then another
six weeks i'm gonna gain up to 204 don't
do that you can't stay that lean it's no
good for anything
sex drive mood brain health uh training
muscle gain none of that shit so you
have to put on some fat and also get
some muscle gain out of that shit so
what i would say is
gain one to two pounds a week until you
hit like
2 25 to 230 and then see how you feel
i would train pretty hard this entire
time
and then
take a d load maybe take an active rest
and then look if you were 250 at the
beginning of the last mass phase then
consider floating back up into the 240s
and see how you are
so
what i don't want you to do is to stay
ultra lean but what i also don't want
you to do is get super mega fat so just
slowly um
let your gains turn a little soft
this is a painful thing and i think this
gets to the mindset it kind of kind of
fucking blows a little bit of dick
because like man you're just not for
many months possibly a year or two ever
gonna look like you did on that stage or
in the first in a couple days leading in
or a couple days leading out i mean this
certain look we're just oh my fucking
god bro i'm fucking shredded
that's the bad thing so that part of
your brain that tells you i want to
fucking look shredded again just look at
it
and let it let it float away see if you
focus on any thought long enough it
becomes not so powerful anymore i just
realized like yeah there was a time for
this and that time is over for now but
as an intelligent human being what
should i value now coming out of the
show and i think the answer is
you should value how good you feel how
good your sleep is and how awesome and
progressive your training is and your
training won't be awesome and
progressive if you're trying to stay too
lean so see the food you're eating food
and thinking fuck it's making me fat or
true
just a little bit fatter but fatter in
such a way that it actually improves
your hormone balance
then makes you
fucking better
bigger stronger etc muscle growth all
that stuff
so treat food as something that yeah
makes you fatter but that's okay i
wouldn't worry about that too much treat
food as something that makes you bigger
and fucking stronger switch that mindset
not into offseason strongman mode to
where you're enormous oh by the way did
you guys see my shirt
we can start making these on team full
rom if you guys want to buy them or some
shit they'll be cheap and uh if i see
you in the street wearing this we are
for sure hugging i will give you a hug
by the way if you ever see me literally
like see me in real life when you go dr
mike and say if my wife's around careful
she has eye lasers but if she's not
around i'll straight up give you a hug
you know what i'm saying we'll take a
pic for the gram tick tock buck swipe
swipe puck
scott we ever gonna get swipe fuck off
the ground
my man
i'm working on it
just shut up about that
folks we're back we're still alive i
mean
in any case
just focus
on
a little bit less of your body and how
it looks and a bit more about how
progress in the gym occurs
keep that one to two pound increase for
a while and then cool it to about a
pound into maintenance and i think
everything was gonna go super well and
uh remember
once you get a certain level of leanness
it's easier to get back to that level of
leanness next time
and i've also noticed through my
bodybuilding career that as i get lean
and get a show in and then come back up
i never come back up to quite as fat as
i ever used to be
so
if you run everything intelligently you
have nothing to worry about you're not
going to balloon in the jab of the hut
um and i think it's going to all go
super well so thank you so much for your
question
all right
the blue arrow seems to be not so
working
all right
oh
wait hold on
conor mcgregor was never my friend with
another question
here's another lamborghini payment
my man
butlers
come get the money go to lambo
i don't ever know where they are oh
that's right they're playing crash test
dummies with my lamborghinis god damn it
i have a lot of butlers
uh here's the question i'm
in exchange
what specific arm movements could i use
and get very strong on and see great
benefit i have never felt cable tricep
extensions activate any muscle at all
tricep ideas bro
you and i are like fucking soul mates
cable push downs are like meh and they
always have a meh to me
skull crushers
i'll give you a technique tip instead of
throwing it back here and bending here
first
break towards your hip at the elbows is
that coming in on camera hopefully
thumbless grip
break towards your hip elbows in and
then touch them wherever it falls
chin
nose
bridge
anywhere here is good to go
if you're super ultra flexible and if
you have sufficiently
longer torso and shorter arms you can
actually touch your neck have a spotter
or else they'll find you dead
super big deep stretch and up right
again
overhead
tricep extensions with an easy bar same
idea i used to be flexible enough and
small enough to do these i can't anymore
elbows in
break forward at the elbows down slow
pause and back up touch the very back of
your neck it'll light you the fuck up
jm presses even in a i think in a smith
machine these work even a little better
it's almost like it's somewhere between
a close grip bench and a skull crusher
another thing you could try
is do as many spell cards as you can
rack the weight have dumbbells close by
get them and do
dumbbell
presses with a big stretch
slowly lowering the weight
and it'll fuck your triceps to death
the cops will be looking at your triceps
later thinking what kind of wild animal
would do this
would do this to somebody's tricep it's
okay bob it's okay
this man did lots of skull crushers give
that a shot i will also say
after the skull crusher crusher's part
of your workout try to do some
bodyweight dips or even some close grip
push-ups and you will find that because
your triceps are so fucked up and tired
now it's a super crazy tricep movement
so i noticed you didn't ask me about
biceps is it because my biceps are small
yes the answer is yes thank you so much
for your question mr conor mcgregor i
loved all your fights by the way
all right identity problem
which is a very interesting avatar just
gave us 20
identity problem
ask yourself a question next time
sir or madam you have more than deserved
it
all right
guys are being ultra ultra generous
i love you all
i was supposed to be anna nicole smith i
turned out to be doctor mike
all right
daniel
kanowski kanewski
kanyewski
i'll just pronounce it in russian i
guess probably closer to the original
polish or some
huge fan daniel says your advice has
changed my entire training program and
diet thanks doc here is money
towards that lambo
okay daniel first of all thank you so
much
folks another thing
i am not so good at very many things but
the thing i am terrible at
is receiving money for no outlay of
services to you so if you want to just
send me money thank you so much i love
you guys
but if you can also ask a question i'll
knock that shit the fuck out of the park
and get you some fucking knowledge
because without me knowing exercise
stuff and helping you out i promise you
i'm a shell of a human being nobody
wants to be around oh thank you for your
generosity and while we're at it thanks
for nothing uh scott the video guy
what have you done lately
you made this all possible you just sit
back there as far as i know you're doing
nothing at all
all right
dalton daltonator 87
welcome to priority membership
kind sir
scott the video guy you seem to be up
and about is there anything i can help
you with
we're going to have to do a battery
change
uh-oh
folks if we have to do a battery change
and we go away
we'll be back so stay tuned
unless the battery change doesn't work
and then you feel like a little rumble
and you see some blue light on the
horizon that mean we actually use an
annihilator class battery and that if
things go wrong it can take a chunk of
the earth out no big deal
it's the detroit metro area who gives a
shit
all right
austin
asks
that shirt shows you're a true
entrepreneur i hope that's spelled wrong
i don't know how to spell that word god
all right you guys so i uh back in the
day i took the gres uh graduate record
exam in the united states is for grad
school and i did quite fine on it but um
there's an essay portion where you have
to type the essay with no autocorrect so
like i was trying to use some a plus
words and shit you feel me but i was
typing them out and i was like holy fuck
i don't know how to spell this word in
real life in a back back back instead of
like you know inferenced i'd be like
pointed too and i just sound dumber i
failed the whole exam all right
austin thank you so much and austin asks
what is the lowest and highest your cals
have ever gone
i did multiple weeks of dieting back
when i used to use gear and didn't
account for thyroid um
stuff
i did uh probably four weeks of dieting
at a thousand calories per day weighing
about 220 215 pounds i mostly spent the
day in grad school doing work
walking insanely slowly back home
training and being under the covers and
watching old batman reruns it was
terrible the highest my calves have ever
gone and i'll give you two answers for
this consistently
around 47.50 in my last mass phase it's
fucking terrible i never want to do it
again though i probably will
um it is 40 70 doesn't sound like a lot
but i'm i guess i'm just like i don't
know a bitch is that was that the
politically correct term
and it was tough i'm not jared feather i
can't eat forever but i will say that in
i did a post joe diet recovery and i did
it all wrong my last show so i did well
for a few days but then um i met up with
charlie after he won his show and or
sorry oh competed at nationals after
winning a show the year before or a
couple months before and after nationals
charlie and i are fucking best friends
we're in the same fucking place and
we're like there's all these treats here
do you want to eat him he's like fuck
yeah so a couple edibles down the hatch
and all of a sudden i think i ate um
eight to nine thousand calories per day
for three days straight
and then i felt very bad and then i
didn't eat much after for a while
yeah
tough times should i just keep going um
yeah i'll tell you
all right
all right
clown shoe
great
name any concerns for lifters with bad
hip slash ankle mobility squatting with
a plate under heels to achieve depth i
asked this as a six foot seven tall bro
bro six seven you could be like my
father you probably are hi dad
no relation
with no plans to compete lunges slash
split squats and okay substitute lunges
and split squats are totally fine
another thing you can do is lots of leg
presses and hack squats where your ankle
mobility doesn't need to be as high
another thing you do is only descend to
the depth in which your ankle mobility
starts to push your heels up and then
don't go any further another one
is get some um
squatting shoes i don't remember offhand
what the company is but omar
has a representative of invested in a
shoe company which makes weightlifting
shoes and one of their options is a
really tall heel um i would get some of
that shit
as far as squatting with a plate under
heels
try to get the plates that are like the
smooth ones
make sure you're really settled in and
never go ultra heavy i would say
don't ever go lower than your 10rm if
you have to stand on a plate because if
something goes wrong fucking shit you're
gonna be they're gonna be putting you
back together like fucking jenga blocks
back at the hospital um if it sets up
you know 10 plus 15 reps really good
control and stuff in the squat like
super upright then then you'll be uh
then you'll be okay be careful also when
you put your feet on there
do half toe half heel
plate
heel on the plate toe and really really
settle before you do anything and make
sure the things don't move
best of luck
all right next up next question is from
daniel green
daniel says hey dr mike do you have any
tips for scapular winging
beyond the standard wall slides push-up
plus grind out serratus anterior
can never seem to get the shoulder
blades under control
daniel unfortunately i know almost
nothing about this subject what i will
say is that if you get stronger and more
muscular and more aware proprioceptively
of your body over time a lot of those
issues tend to dissipate
and if you're doing exercises and you're
aware of when the winging is starting to
happen and you fix it and continue to do
reps over time it tends to happen less
as to the exercises you were talking
about
i'm going to give you the really
skeptical take of i don't think anyone
knows if they work very well um they may
not work at all they may work to a
considerable extent what i would say is
do a series of exercises that you
believe is the best continue to train
with good technique
once you get some traction and the
problem is improving keep doing what
you're doing
don't expect this to resolve in like
something clicks and a week later you
don't have it it might take some time so
best of luck to you and i hope that
works out
all right
raid kabir welcome to priority
membership youtube tells me to tell you
and you're so welcome
okay
let's see who's up next this super chat
thing is hard to operate
ingrid cold
a super villain's name i'm sure
hi dr mike big fan i have an irrational
hatred of barbell bench press maybe it's
rational it also irritates my elbow i
told you it was rational uh-oh we're
getting blinking scott the video guy
finish the question
are dumbbell cable press and fly enough
for chest yes any alternatives you can
suggest deficit weighted push-ups
machine presses of all kinds dumbbells
of different angles and try to
play with different grips and different
inclines on the barbell press but
conventional barbell bench press is not
required for any pet growth at all you
can get as big of pecs as you want with
none of that shit folks we're gonna tune
the fuck out for like two seconds we're
gonna switch batteries and either
youtube's gonna fuck us off forever
we'll let you know or we'll be back in
like a minute or two and i'll answer as
many of your questions as i can we're on
here for a bunch
oh shit i'm on tv
ah sparkling ice just like grandma never
made in the soviet union
ingrid
we're back so basically
rational or not and if it irritates your
elbow it's quite rational you don't have
to do bench pressing
it is a fucking insane illusion scott
how come there's not a light on the
camera does that tell us anything
yeah this is just a backup
so the light is like telling me nothing
ever
so it could be live all these times and
there's no light and i could be like
you know this is where i masturbate
make sure the camera's never facing you
it is always facing me
who the hell masturbates off camera
there's a waste of uh what's that
website uh only fans
you should i started only fans uh
that's some shit you'll never unsee good
god all right anyway ingrid yeah you 100
just injured sorry i've been calling you
the wrong name good fucking god i'm an
idiot indrid um
you don't need bench press you just need
high stimulus fatigue ratio exercises
various dumbbell or barbell incline or
flat pressing
even some wider grip
leaning your body forward dips all kinds
of machine presses and you're totally
good to go no problem at all
okay
black
beard zorro
that's a hell of a name
asks
can the bulk slash cut style of dieting
work for calisthenics athletes yes
however you have to make sure that you
have a clear understanding
of your best power to weight ratio body
weight
and the way you get that is just through
experimentation here's what i mean
bulk up to like
10 pounds bigger than you usually are
your calisthenics result is going gonna
suck don't worry it's temporary
diet the fat off to get to like five
pounds bigger than normal
and then spend about three months doing
calisthenics at that body weight one of
generally two things will happen
thing one is your performance is on
average not as good because you're too
fucking big
okay now you know that
thing two is your performance could be
better
it's possible that performance could be
relatively equal but for simplicity
purposes we're gonna throw that away if
it's equal shit you gotta you can pick
from whatever you want but very likely
it's either gonna be worse or better if
it's better fuck yes if it's worse
go back down to your old body weight and
see if it improves and if and probably
when it does you'll be like okay my
optimal body weight is definitely not as
high as i thought it was it could be at
what i was at or it could be lower
after a while of no dieting
take time to lose 5 or 10 pounds and
keep training for calisthenics if your
performance declines ooh it turns out
your optimal body weight was pretty
close to where you were and stay at that
new body weight for two or three months
to let your body reacclimate
if your performance increases well shit
but you got yourself a new low body
weight that you should be staying
remember calisthenics athletes for the
most part are not very large people
if on the other hand that weight gain
experiment works and you're stronger and
your calisthenics result is better
then stay there for a bit
do a little fat loss phase to get even
leaner you'll for sure your result will
be even better maybe drop five pounds
and then after a few months try to go up
again
ten pounds again two maybe let's say you
started at 140. we realized like 145 to
150 was even better try to get to 150
155 and see after three months of
staying there if it gets better if not
you go back to that middle ground and
boom then you found it for the next
little while next year or two that
should be the body weight you stay at
if you found that if there's another
performance increase shit keep going
right
bulking cutting for the rest of us
because like we don't care about
performance necessarily it doesn't
matter it's all ball cuts and the
average weight goes up for you when the
weight goes up you have to test it as
it's stable to see if your performance
is better if it is sweet if not no big
deal now here's the thing
as at a certain let's say you do
eventually find your body weight at
which it's it's optimal for you to
perform you can still put on muscle and
reduce fat and get even better and there
i would just bulk like take two months
to bulk like literally five pounds
your performance might falter a little
bit and then take another two months to
cut another five pounds same weight at
the end but you might have a pound or
two more muscle and a pound or two less
fat repeat that a few times over a few
years and eventually you're shredded as
fuck
bitches knocking on your fucking door
with heavy dildos and you're like jesus
christ are those for me i should have
never gotten good at calisthenics
um i think that's exactly how it's gonna
go
mike we're getting a bunch of messages
that we missed a bunch
dude this arrow which way to the fucking
arrow point bruh
i know it's crazy okay injured we got oh
there's oh the oh wait no this ui sucks
sorry guys all right
well michael venables
said keep doing the good work i'm on my
track to come okay so we got that one
already why don't these go away
damn it youtube
that one's done right
but sometimes i just get new ones
refresh randomly
weird all right folks we are trying to
get everybody so if
we take your money but don't answer your
question
are we even allowed to do that
fuck
we're not trying to do that we're trying
to get to everybody for sure
mark fletcher asks happen to know about
gastroesophageal reflux disease surgery
holy fuck
i don't even know those words
don't lift anymore because
uh reflux induced cough won't go away
i don't know anything
about gastroesophageal reflux disease
surgery what i do know is that there are
many treatments for gastroesophageal
reflux before you get to surgery and i
hope you've explored those with your
physician
if that surgery is the last resort
it's probably pretty intense but i
imagine after recovery from that surgery
you can probably go back to doing most
normal activities so i would say the
general recommendation with surgery is
really make sure you've exhausted almost
every other option and that this
terrible thing that requires surgery in
your life is sufficiently bad for you to
take all the risks of surgery
i wish i could help more with that
all right tim c
says rp diet recommends eating before
dinner
but some recommend going to bed on an
empty stomach to promote gh release can
you talk about going to bed on an empty
stomach versus something like casein
protein
so
it's not clear to me that gh release is
really modified highly by how much food
is in your gi tract if anything it may
delay the pulse of the gh release to
later
in addition if you have growth hormone
released while you have free form amino
acids from casein you're more likely to
anabolize to construct muscle tissue
if you don't have any free amino acids
from a meal you didn't eat the gh
release will mostly go to burning fat
it's kind of the question of do you want
the gh to mostly work as a muscle
increase modulator or as a fat loss
modulator
and as long as your pre-bedtime meal
generally isn't super high carb and high
fat and it's mostly just high protein
and especially if you eat it maybe an
hour before bed so a lot of the stomach
based digesting has been done by the
time you go to sleep you should be
totally in the clear if you'd like to
experiment with uh finishing your last
meal two or three hours before you go to
bed uh and seeing if you get better
results that's totally cool i don't
think there's anything here i would
worry about
to a very large extent
all right taymor day welcome to priority
membership i feel like one of those like
female
post-apocalypse apocalyptic like dis
dystopian androids well welcome to your
new new life life life life
scott is that just me or is that the
camera
no
we apparently skipped a bunch of chats
and they went off the screen and they're
not available anymore so i'm going to
have people read ask so tell people
won't get to them
what the fuck
how did this
i think if you skip one and click the
next one by accident the old ones
disappear
so you probably didn't even see it holy
shit
should i hit pop out chat here
pop out yeah i'm gonna hit it i'm gonna
hit pop chat okay
oh
all right
pop out chat
um
okay
viper
i can't i see a new one i'm just gonna
answer it
viper161579 says did you see derek's new
vid about you
derek
who more plates more dates no
um
it's probably about the oral steroids
thing
i'll address that some other time
um
also in that oral steroids video i think
i probably made a few statements
that could have been made better
i'll actually talk about one of them now
i don't i haven't seen this video but
i probably said something to the effect
of a short course of orals will not
significantly alter your test production
and that's something i knew was wrong
before i even said it
the reality is a short course of orals
or a short course of pretty much any
sort of method of delivery
will almost certainly depress and
potentially completely extinguish your
testosterone production
but the reality is that in almost every
case it is going to come back up
relatively quickly and with relatively
no ill effects
and especially if it's a short course of
orals that clear the bloodstream quite
quickly or clear the systemic uh
imposition quickly
then
you're going to have this time when
you're on the orals and things are going
to go well and then you're going to have
time when you're off the rolls and maybe
a weird week maybe not even
i've watched a lot of people do this and
i haven't actually met anyone who had
any sort of ill effects
and then your test levels come back up
and everything's great
so
that's probably what i should have said
um there's probably a couple other
things in that video i could have done
better i suppose that's true for like uh
um
most things
yeah
in any case
oh and uh
viper had another question oh no he said
by the way you should raise the price
for questions because there's way too
many coming in at once how the fuck do
you raise the price for questions is
that even something we can control
suppose viper thinks that's the case and
who seems like he knows what he's
talking about
scott the video guy you're fired
all right
excellent all right
all right nathaniel r
says best plan of attack for someone
that is 30
plus
body fat i assume or is it yeah 30
uh
plus body fat that wants to lose fat in
a struggle with losing weight because of
depression
thanks in advance well us all two-prong
you hear
first i would talk to a licensed
psychologist or psychiatrist probably
psychologist first and start to work on
the core
architecture around your depression
so that regardless of what's happening
with your body weight you can get at
that
and make it better
in addition to that
um what i would do
is i would not worry about losing weight
because that can be fucking depressing
what i could suggest in your case may be
a good thing to do
is to focus on eating better feeding
your body healthy shit most of the time
and a few pieces junk every now and
again
having some good physical activity
regular activity that you enjoy in your
life
getting a decent step count maybe eight
or ten thousand steps a day get you one
of these chinese communist party step
tracker so they know where you are and
go from there and i think after some
time you're probably just going to get
lean or doing that stuff and maybe
that'll brighten your mood a little bit
and then you might be able to say hey
i'm actually in a position where i can
do a dedicated fat loss phase and not
get so so upset
but i would say that speaking to
a a licensed therapist and really
getting at the depression thing is
probably a good idea yeah it's a serious
thing way more serious than weight loss
i'll say that
harrison grant asks can we partner in
selling turk for hashtag lambo fund
you know i actually have made entirely
of trochasterone
how many trochasterone tags are going to
see this thanksgiving
a little different spin to turkey
uh yeah absolutely we're starting to
sell fake tricasterone asap
is there even real trochasterone being
sold
all right
next up is parker johnson
any insight on how to prevent headaches
during training tried to take a one week
deload and the headaches eventually came
back never had this before in five plus
years
there could be many things that are
causing your headache and if this
continues i would go see a doctor like a
real doctor not me a medical doctor not
a sports physiologist
but
here are a few suggestions
i would maybe decrease the intensity of
your valsalva maneuver
and how much you hold your breath
to those to two separate and somewhat
interrelated piece of advice so let me
be specific about south of maneuver is
when you brace you
like that bottom of how you lift do that
less that may require lightening the
load but as the weight come down god
just breathe out
weight comes up breathe in breathe out
kind of just try to breathe normally and
lift it's not going to be the best
performance but you could have several
weeks like that where you'd have a zero
headaches like fuck thank god i got the
headache thing solved and then maybe
slowly start val-salving a little bit
harder but never super maximum another
thing is some people subconsciously hold
their breath
when they're training so i'll start
branching a little loose
i used to train my sister
way back in undergrad and she was a
fucking baller but she would hold her
breath subconsciously during sets of 20
in the squat and i was like sonia why
are your lips turning blue when she's
like i don't know and i watched her on a
set and i was like
you're
breathing yes and she's like i don't
think i'm breathing
breathe
don't do a heart or any valsalva
maneuver and also make sure that your
blood glucose is stable some people get
headaches if the blood glucose drops so
maybe have like a snack before you go
that's pretty decent in carbs like a
bagel or something and then they have a
gatorade with you and uh just sip it
through the workout it might might help
if those things don't help then i would
definitely seek out
medical intervention
all right
shall i keep going
i'm trying to scroll here to make sure
i close super chat mike
and then anyone who missed questions ask
them at renaissance periodization will
be orange
okay we'll do a few of those then the
first one is joseph mcgreevy if you see
that yes
dr mike on upper body day why would we
go push exercise
push exercise pull exercise pull
exercise and alternate this next upper
body day as opposed to push pull push
pull for hypertrophy so i have a very
deep technical explanation for this in
the hypertrophy uh book that we have
scientific principles of appropriate
training
but a quick explanation is
sometimes it's better to get a ton of
metabolite sequestration
and do a ton of local damage to that
muscle and the best way is to inundate
it with set after set after set
if you go a set of one thing instead of
another thing that can take the
metabolites and wash them out between
sets more so
it can keep the systemic fatigue as high
as ever but the local fatigue sort of
drops off and we want the ratio of local
fatigue to systemic fatigue to be as
high as possible so we want a dedicated
session where we really do a lot of
pushing and easier on the pulling and
another dedicated session where we do
a lot of pulling and less pushing
another thing is that sometimes you can
have machines in the gym that are closer
to each other and if you're doing wildly
different muscle groups you might have
to walk across and that's kind of
fucking annoying
and you kind of want to finish one thing
and go to the other another more minor
reason is like a mind muscle connection
so you get a big ass pump with like
flies for packs and when you go to the
machine press you're super fucking
pumped you're ultra connected to your
pecs and you can just crush the shit but
if you did a set of pull-ups after you
did the flies yeah like it takes a
couple sets to get really connected to
the lats and kind of your pecs are a
little bit in the way and once you
you're still feeling them and once that
resolves you're like great i'm in tune
with my lats now and it's time to go
back to chest again that kind of blows
it's totally the uh the benefit is that
your performance can be a little higher
so if you're a performance athlete like
a power lifter or a strong man or a
thrower the alternating method may
actually be superior but for hypertrophy
i have an inkling that this is the
better way to go
all right
buck law wow
sweet
um bucklau says thank you doc for
everything lost 35 pounds wife thinks i
look great and that's so important i
feel great life is good question advice
on how to choose a career
for longevity
holy shit um
so
it depends on what you mean by longevity
do you mean longevity of the career
still making money after some time or a
career that doesn't kill you
i would say career for longevity
probably the two things you want to
concern yourself with if it's for actual
the career itself
affecting your
probability of living long
the obvious one is don't pick anything
statistically risky like like a
mercenary for the wagner group don't do
that
uh two more
points make sure you're really
passionate about what you're doing right
in most countries of the world and more
and more every day in most of the
developed world the money is really not
a factor of longevity all of us make
enough money to make the kind of choices
we need to to live as long as possible
so i wouldn't worry about income too
much as most jobs if you do them well on
good enough income
pick a job you really love because
people who have passion actually
literally statistically outlive
everybody else and the other one is make
sure that the work is challenging enough
to make you feel like you're doing
something but not overwhelmingly
stressful at all times so you may like
have a choice to be a mathematician at a
university and you love teaching you
love interacting with students it's
challenging and fun but not too much
uh not too stressful that could let you
live longer than if you went and go
traded stocks on wall street stonks or
whatever they're called now and uh you
know you make make a lot more money
trading stocks but the fucking crazy
psychotic pressure buy buy sell sell
that's the only thing i know about
stocks to be honest um
that might just fucking drive you to the
ground and you'd be fucking dead so
though that would be my advice
all right
james k
nope sorry wrong person
identity problem asks
recently started testosterone
replacement therapy during a cut having
strength gains but feel like i can't get
the most out of it because eating in a
deficiency tips thoughts ppl routine no
worries at all easy answer super short
actually
you're not getting the most out of it
first of all because it's replacement
and not going to be a lot to get but if
you were actually medically
low testosterone you will get a lot out
of it so but here's the thing if you're
cutting now you won't get out of a lot
out of it now no big deal though because
you'll lose a shitload of fat and you'll
probably gain just a little bit of
muscle during that time
as soon as that's over and you
transition back to a bulk holy fuck
you're going to blow up like crazy
and a huge fraction more than usual is
going to be muscle unless it's going to
be fat so don't worry about the short
term get that body fat off it's just
setting you up to get those big gains
later so you're totally in the clear
all right sean patton
says my super chat was skipped
mr sean patton please let us know what
your question is and at renaissance
periodization and we will get right the
fuck back to you uh if you could repeat
that because it's skipped we don't
actually see it but let us know what it
is and we'll get right to you
scott the video guy you want to make
sure we uh catch him
yeah i'm doing the best all right well
very quirky do better
okay
that's like one of my favorite memes
where it's like the i forgot it's like
wall street movie and he's like
can this work and the guy's like no why
not
it's they're just disappearing for no
reason guys so we're trying to get away
thanks youtube i mean seriously thank
you your fucking platform is
unbelievable
could you do a little bit better
i feel so entitled saying that i'm gonna
shut up all right
next up next up next up
and is are going fast
okay okay okay here we go
boy like
says how much difference does optimal
training volume have over just doing 10
sets per week in one session
it depends if your
10 sets per week at least in the workout
or on the week falls between your min of
effective volume and maximum recoverable
and right in the middle it's going to
make a small difference maybe 15 over
the course of a long term
if 10 secs or is over your mrv or under
your mev it's going to be a night and
day difference you could gain almost
nothing with 10 sets and gain everything
you ever wanted with something that is
different so
i would say it's probably a good idea to
at least try your little bit of your
best to get that optimal volume going
uh versus just doing uh some standard
thing now i will say if your gains are
going great don't change anything you
don't have to but if your gains like meh
or not at all i would look into the
volume thing
all right
amne says mike i've been training for a
year and transform my physique thanks to
you amazing people ask how i do it
expecting some cheat code i point them
to you thank you well amy thank you so
much um gee you know i wish i wish i
could take more credit for that but i
think you did all the hard work so thank
you so much
all right tim addy says hey dr mike i'm
looking for a new gym
near the royal oak
near the royal oak and i'm considering
powerhouse madison heights and black
mamba barbell any other gyms i should
check out so i think um
if i may say this scott the video guy
scott the video guy himself trains at
black mamba so you can punch him in the
face when you get there and tell him his
videos are shit
and uh powerhouse madison heights have
only ever heard good things about
um
yeah
i think that uh i don't know any other
gymnast area good enough to recommend
them but i think between those two
you're fucking golden yeah
all right
d mike
demick mic d mike
all right
here's the question i am trying to
become stronger without putting on size
i'm looking to continuously increase my
base strength long term
versus achieving
realized strength peaking how
how to do this
without putting on size i would say i
would alternate training mostly for sets
of three to six with sets of five to
eight as accessories for three months or
so
and take one or two months to peak
sets of one to three mostly with
accessories at
some combination of sets of three to six
and five to eight peak get your new
lifts one rmd everything great did well
one or two weeks of deload slash active
rest and then restart that process again
mike hamrick
says i'm 36 with
a lot of on and off experience but i'm
looking to get into a natural
competition by 40 and want to find a
coach to help me with my program and get
serious
lots of good coaches but i'll tell you
this
i would highly implore you to get
serious on your own
multiple months and multiple years of
fucking awesome training putting on size
getting leaner putting on size getting
leaner
a competition is a serious fucking thing
and it's so fucking hard it's gonna push
you the furthest you've ever been pushed
so
there's lots of great coaches and
renaissance periodizations look up our
coaches you can find one of them and
they're going to help you
they can provide you with tons of
guidance and support and even motivation
and inspiration
but the consistency they physically
can't make you do so start that on your
own and when you're rolling
then i think the coach is worth the
money before then
you got to get something going yourself
all right
cold servopi
asks my question is what about an anavar
only cycle i don't care about maximum
gains just very risk averse i would run
this six to eight months per year with
time off so
i wouldn't run an oral past a few weeks
maybe two months or something like that
16 months per year and orals is
questionable technically speaking anavar
for that long probably won't fuck you up
but i wouldn't make bets on that
um i think if you want to run something
for 68 months per year it's probably
time to go with the big boys and do the
injectables but what i would also say is
if you're very risk averse i would
probably not recommend anabolic steroids
at all
because they
destroy your health
and
they're destroying mine right now it's
great it's not great
give that some thought um
all right
posterior pounder oh what a fucking
great name
got a lot of pounding in my day no no
wait wait said that wrong i've been
pounded a lot in my day
deficit deadlifts are attempting oh
sorry are a template glute exercise i
took that's a little too far
how do snatch grip deadlifts compared to
deficit for fatigue and development ooh
i have a good answer
similar effect on the lower body because
it's essentially a deficit by widening
grip but they require quite a bit more
especially upper back
activation and uh work and thus they're
a great movement to really train your
upper back to be strong and erect there
i say
regular deficit deadlifts train more of
your hamstrings and glutes adductors and
lower back mid-back and glutes
and are less limited by your upper back
musculature and ability to stay upright
hey mike so now people are just adding
us that didn't actually super chat
oh sweet question so i'm going to read
some that you might have missed
did you do best plan of attack for
someone that is 30
bmi i did okay
to all of you lying fuck you
uh just kidding you got harrison grant
can we partner in selling turk for lambo
fund yes
okay
all right back to super chat
ooh okay
let me get one real quick with jeremy
orem
if you are running strength and
conditioning for a high school football
team high school football
how would you handle that during the
regular season ah yes i've actually done
strength conditioning for both high
school
and for college
during the regular season what you
probably want is probably two weight
training workouts per week
you probably want them spaced as far
away from games as possible
and if important games especially occur
on the weekends
then you want the workouts staggered to
like monday wednesday you want the
volumes to be relatively low mostly sets
of three to six repetitions
power moves basic strength moves very
low volume
essentially don't want the kids to get
sore doms at all that's how low over
volume you keep them roughly the same
strength and maybe some of the kids get
a little stronger during the season and
you're fucking golden
uh off season which is fucking nine
months of the year is when they make the
fucking big games there's a huge huge
super fucking big problem fallacy in
high school football in the united
states where people think in season
training is when you get jacked and
that's fucking bullshit it's off season
that does the work in season you're just
trying to keep them explosive fast
powerful and just enough volume to keep
their muscle and strength kind of where
it was before they started the season
all right
next up is planetary godzilla god damn
what a sweet name my name sucks
33 years old 6 foot 155
pounds at 12 body fat goal is 200 pounds
and 10 body fat is this possible at this
age if not what is a realistic goal
can train six days a week have prior
experience on on off for three years
so
um i would say it is a pretty outlandish
goal that may be possible but i'll give
you better advice than that
we can't tell you if it's possible yet
because you don't have enough on
experience
so consistently show up to the gym eat
the food do all the stuff
get as good of gains as you can and
after a year see where you're at
and then after a year siri at after your
series yet if you're consistently
climbing like this and like here's where
you were and here's 200 or whatever
percent body fat if you're doing one of
these hey maybe you'll get there if
you're doing one of these
probably not if you do one of these shit
like you'll get there soon and then have
different goals i'm not a huge fan of
ultra long-term goals
because essentially from like um
just a like a
logic space problem there are too many
unknowns uh see you you can't it's it
see the analogy is like um
a shitty analogy but it's like plotting
a course towards the other side of the
milky way and so we're gonna go this way
and this way and that way that way
except we haven't actually mapped out
the milky way or where the fucking black
holes are where the alien refueling
stations are so like we just do make
believe um it's too far in advance the
best we could do maybe as a society
that's you know space faring is to go to
the next and have a habitable world set
up a colony everything goes well couple
millennia later do the same thing etc
and then you sort of piecemeal it as you
go i would say that's the better
approach to take
short-term goals i'm going to gain 10
pounds in the next three months and i'm
going to lose five pounds of fat two
months after that i'm gonna then i'm
gonna repeat and then that is going to
set you on a trajectory the slope of
that trajectory will allow you to
predict a little bit better although
remember everything is asymptotic in
lifting so it's going to curve like that
so if your goal is here but your
trajectory is this
probably not going to be
so likely to hit it at that time frame
do your best
and you'll find out that's my best best
advice
mike did you get baller how much water
weight can you retain from cortisol no
i assume baller actually paid
yes how much water weight can you retain
from cortisol
at least five to ten pounds
if you are taking prescription
hydrocortisone or any of those other
oral steroids it can be
15 to 20 pounds insane amounts of weight
cortisol in the natural environment if
you're just experiencing some fatigue
towards the end of a mesocyclone diet
easy five to ten pounds body water it
can be less it can be a little more but
that is kind of the expected range great
question
all right
all right
next up let's see who we got i'm gonna
scroll a lot for this here
okay
did we get all the backlog people
we're working on it all right
machiavelli the don says how do you
progress your rir week to week when
using maya reps and biorep match
so
you do the ir rar the same way
but you just apply it to whatever set
you're doing so for example the first
set of wire match is a straight set
let's say it's a two r week two rar put
the barbell down
next you start the mile rep set
you get to whatever reps is two r let's
say it's eight put the shit down let's
say you got 15. now you got eight
rest three to five seconds pick it up
again do another whatever tool our ir is
let's say that's five now you're up to
13. rest for a little bit hit two once
your set is done and put it away that's
how you match
so
every single individual maya rep is done
with the rar progression that you want
and then when it's rar1 every single
maya up shit it goes to r1 that's it
pretty straightforward
all right nick
ackey
says
hey dr mike when i train hard i clench
slash grind my teeth i started wearing a
mouth guard to keep them safe is this
okay could it cause job problems no
mouth guards are actually recommended i
think by uh dental professionals when
teeth grinding is a thing they always
tell me to do it i never really do it
because i'm bad at the teeth thing
they also say i have ugly teeth
it's really a mean thing for them to say
keep wearing your mouth guard you're
totally good no no job problems
anticipated
um scott is a super chat back on or is
it still off uh i turned it off so we
just got the people taken care of okay
all right
viper once 1161579
asks
um i know a 17 year old who is impatient
and wants to ask around at his gym for
steroids
what advice to keep him natty
i mean like you can bring me over a real
talk living fuck out of him
but uh i think the best advice to folks
like that is to tell them about the
beneficial effects and side effects of
steroids at the same time
the problem with telling people only the
side effects that are bad is that they
it's this 1980s anti-drug commercial
bullshit it never fucking works because
they know you're keeping something from
them people do drugs like so for example
if they told you look heroin will feel
unbelievably good
like oh hell yeah it'll ruin your
fucking life also
when someone tells you that again i feel
like if they were a really anti-drug
psycho that didn't know anything about
how drugs really work they wouldn't tell
me that first part do you get a little
bit of sort of like a seriousness with
them and a bit of believability so what
i would say is look man at 17 years old
if you start steroids
if they're going to get you jacked like
you're going to be so much more muscular
so much leaner check this out
your nuts will likely shrink down and
then when girls see your nuts when
you're trying to get a beach at the
party they're going to laugh at you and
probably tell everybody you know
there's a good chance there's like a 50
50 that your dick won't work you'll get
horny super horny because you're on
steroids your dick won't work because
the hormone dynamics are all off you got
pimples like the size of part of your
thumb right here
uh probably start going bald earlier
like in college all kinds of really
nasty shit but you'll be jacked baby and
they're like holy fuck that sucks like
yeah check it out also your brain is
maturing and developing and your actual
intelligence is still coming up and
steroids have a decently well documented
ability to impinge on that process so
you may never become as smart as you
could have been unless you wait till
you're like in your late 20s to consider
steroids
if you throw that bullshit at him at the
same time acknowledging the good stuff
but also saying look there's lots of bad
shit here you give them a realistic take
and uh you know that's probably the best
you can do
you could also attend to the impatience
and say like let me tell you a number of
great champions that were impatient
nobody
no fucking buddy has impatience problems
that fucking last so
yeah
all right back to the super chats scott
all right
brent
guilin
gwylan
sorry brent i suck could you
theoretically run a hypertrophy block
for legs congruently with a strength
block for bench
optimally compared to dedicated blocks
yes
if the muscle groups are completely
different it is possible
legs you can train fibertrophy upper
body for strength and that totally works
really really well close to optimum what
you don't want to do is like triceps do
hypertrophy chest do strength because
then one interferes with the other
so give that some thought great question
all
right daniel
anderson
is it gonna stay out
thanks
how do i look i sound a bad for a little
bit oh i see but how do i look look do i
look good i mean sexy oh yeah daddy fuck
all right let me pop that shirt
ooh
i never pop off my lambo shirt
you can pull my lambo shirt off my dead
body
all right
daniel anderson says i got pretty bad
gyno off of trt
i had a little bit from puberty but now
it's bad is surgery my only option also
isn't dangerous
uh i have had gynecomastia removal
surgery it is not remotely dangerous it
is one of the most well practiced and uh
actually least invasive and
most kind of open and shut procedures it
is nonetheless technically surgery so
it's serious but i would consult with
the doctor
what i would do is um
give some readings online to options
about gynecomastia treatment and before
you get to surgery see if any of the
other work ones work sometimes a course
of anti-estrogens can can really suck
that down to where it just basically
looks like nothing and it is good
forever people have reported that but
sometimes if you have the serious like
the hard mass
surgery is probably the only option at
that point nothing i say here is medical
advice and uh
talk to talk to your physician or get a
few other expert opinions and go from
there but uh yeah gynecomastia removal
surgeries it's not typically a super big
deal
all right
cameron couple says hi dr mike i have to
train at 6 a.m workouts after eating
feel awful they do it's faster training
an option to wake up at five lots of
conflicting info online fucking internet
right all this great info but a bunch of
it's fucking wrong
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
faster workouts faster workouts are
totally great wake up
have like half a thing a gatorade half a
thing away if you don't want totally
fasted and you're good to go or wake up
have some fluids go to the gym you'll be
golden eat your post-workout meal i
train fasted basically every day i don't
talk about it a lot because i don't want
to offend anyone but there's a small
most people who are into fasting or
whatever are awesome there's a small
fraction of fasting people are fucking
psychotic and i don't want to be
mistaken for them so like i wake up
generally like around 9am 8 30 to 9 00
and i start training around like 9 30 or
10 and i don't need anything before and
everything goes great because all the
glycogen is loaded everything's good and
then right after i have my post workout
serial which i'm sure you guys have seen
on my instagram
man this is awful wow okay i got it i
got it it disappeared from the chat i
found it i'm just not gonna look at the
the
the top bullshit i'm not gonna look at
it i'll just scroll yeah
alex asks
does it matter how you weigh rice dry or
cooked and do you weigh uh meat slash
chicken raw or cooked it does matter it
does matter so it matters what the
recipe is and it matters how you're
reading the uh instructions so if it's
like cups of rice almost always it
should specify raw or cooked if it
doesn't whoever your coach is ask them
to specify or whatever the recipe is
look up and see if it's specified
if it's grams of weight it's almost
always dry and you can just assume that
and then after you cook it it doesn't
fucking matter because you know how much
total rice you made and you portion it
evenly and you're good to go
the problem with rice is based on how
you cook it it weighs more or less but
on average i think it's multiplied by
about three or four so like if it's 40
grams
dry it ends up being like 160 grams or
cooked or something like that
meat
or i would almost always weigh out raw
because the cooked meat is based on how
much you cook it it's actually going to
shrink in size and weight but the
protein content stays the same
so
there you go
all right
ahan shankwakar
i know you fam i know you from like
eight other forums this is awesome thank
you for your question mena wrote an
article about cns fatigue not being a
very
a big result of heavy lifting why do low
rep deadlifts make my whole body tired
and lower my focus slash drive i think
it's because um
cns fatigue or what's generally called
fatigue in sport science cumulative
fatigue or otherwise known as systemic
fatigue i think is real
i i i love meno ameno's actually a great
personal friend of mine um
i just disagree with him about this
cordially so i think it's real fatigue
it's the same if you use room to your
point
like i'm sure i'm wrong on a bunch of
stuff i'm sure derek moore plays more
dates just flamey right now hey hey
scott can you could you look it up and
see if he's talking shit about us sure
motherfucker
take a shot at this title all right
kevin smith
asks
do you drink diet soda year round does
it have any effect on micro gut biome
coke zero rocks
so so far we don't know a whole lot
about the microbiome we do know that
it's very adaptable like bacteria are
very fucking resilient
sort of short of nuking them with all
the antibiotics in the world it's really
not a big deal
here's the thing i do drink coke year
round i have no gi issues whatsoever so
i'm not terribly worried about it
interestingly enough of all of the
artificial sweeteners they've tested so
far
stevia or stevia depending on how you
pronounce it has the most prominent
deleterious not deleterious is a
terrible word to use here
marginally slightly negative effect on
your gut microbiome and it's the natural
one
aspartame seems to ups and downs doesn't
really do much on the net balance and i
think coke zero is mostly super loaf and
i don't think that affects the got
microbiome to a large extent as of the
studies that i've seen so far there
could be more studies that point one
direction or another
i will say that it's probably not a big
deal and the long-term literature on
consumption of diet soda or artificial
sweeteners when properly co-factored for
everything seems like nothing bad is
happening so i wouldn't worry about it
too much
and at some point like uh if how fucking
important is they got microbiome if it's
going to keep me away from drinking
fucking diet soda god damn it it better
be super fucking important and it's not
he did a 40 minute critique of your
start with the world's only video of my
15 minute video and i don't love it if
it's positive negative or otherwise i'm
sure it's yeah the title is
dot dot dot pardon question mark oh shit
yeah so
controversy
lamborghini fund
all right
okay
ooh of course it skipped a bunch
holy shit i skipped a ton all right
what the fuck oh
hold up folks i gotta get to scrolling
properly
okay
jacob mackey asks hey dr mike does some
magletide allow progress hypertrophy in
parentheses to be achieved at a lower
body fat than without and will you use
it for your next show i don't think it
has an effect on the body fat situation
much probably a small marginal effect
i would think it's the hypertrophy
occurs at the same body weights either
way it does squash the living focus of
your hunger and i will almost certainly
be using it for my next show yeah
good question ahan
shankwakar is back
if nsaids plus cryo he asks clear away
inflammatory cells needed for healing
adaptation
wouldn't they also prevent proper
healing post injury yes they actually
would and there are at least a few
research papers showing that healing
time and healing completeness from
people that took a lot of very powerful
anti-inflammatories is lessened than
people who didn't
so i see your body is actually very good
at healing properly with nsaids and cryo
etc it just takes longer to heal so i
wouldn't worry about completeness of
healing as much as the duration
so
what i would say is use nsaids and cryo
only to the extent that you're
interested in controlling
extra way getting in the way of your
daily life and pain tolerance
inflammation and potentially using them
in the tail three or four days before a
really important competition if you
happen to still be solar and tight so
that you can get clear of all that to
compete outside of that i really just
wouldn't use them unless it's to again
like you're really hurting and you need
some fucking shit to take the edge off
so
um the whole thing with like people
regularly getting cryo as a part of
their normal training even though
they're concerned with adaptation uh bad
idea really fucking not ideal not a huge
problem but like a needless
chink in the armor where you don't
fucking need one
all right
will mcswain
says thank you dr mike for all the
knowledge i just started bjj any advice
for a new white belt follow sloth report
on instagram immediately that's my coach
josh vogel he's great he knows things
and advice for new white belt is
just have fun
do your best and just try to learn the
techniques and don't do
this a lot and do oh where am i supposed
to be putting my hands oh it's here and
things are working or they're not but
in any situation ask yourself what could
i be doing here that can improve my
position just a little bit so if
someone's trying to choke you just put
your hand here and try to push it away
and if someone's on top of you and you
oh i know how to get out on a shrimp
just at every moment try to be rational
logical calm collected and just try to
do your best
and you're going to notice that you're
really fucking slow and terrible and you
get beat a lot no big deal
your brain is a neural network
not ai but ni natural intelligence and
it learns automatically so you just
expose it to multiple trials and you
have no idea how it's learning it learns
anyway so even if you're thinking oh my
god it's overwhelming i can't remember
all this bullshit just try to do your
best at every intersection and at first
you're going to be slow and shitty and
awful and then eventually going to get
better and better and better and you're
going to be like oh my god i know things
and then here's what's really going to
hit you after about six months to a year
a new white belt will come to the gym
and they'll you'll go with them and
you'll just beat the living fuck out of
them you're like oh my god they don't
know anything
and that's when you first realize you
know stuff best of luck man i wish you
the best
james caldwell
says
had horrible tennis and or golfer's
elbow in both waited seven months able
to get back in after physical therapy
still too much doms in forums after
workouts whoa trippy
damn
okay
if your forearms are getting super domzy
try not squeezing the bars much
another thing is
if you have doms in the forearms don't
train them until they heal but then
train them when they heal and eventually
the doms will subside and get less
frequent and during that time you'll
probably have bridgery the fuck out of
your forearms surely just kind of slowly
ease into it
and if you are in a situation where your
forearms only get crazy doms on one day
a week but then you wait a whole week
and then that another that same one day
that workout causes crazy doms what i
would do is invest in some like grippers
or something and like two other days of
the week evenly interest based do a
couple of sets of gripper work like iron
mind has great grippers and then it's
going to build up your forearm strength
so that you probably don't experience
doms anymore or much less and then
you'll probably be better off
i'm going to close super chats we'll
answer like the 10 remaining
and then we'll shut it down
all right
this super chat shit got crazy yo yeah
and james martin just joined so thanks
jamie all right james martin folks if
you join our little cult
cult
we're gonna have animal sacrifices
crazy shit
teens are we allowed to say that
no we're not
jk
we'll have cool culture all right
michael bohlen not to be confused with
michael bolton of course
asks any upcoming audio books you can
disclose and will these streams be more
regular frequent i think scott the video
guy and i are going to be trying to do
this once
jared feather is going to probably join
maybe even this coming week
maybe once a week maybe once every two
weeks or something we'll be getting in
the live and embarrassing ourselves and
by ourselves i mean me
scott's behind the camera he has nothing
to worry about works better too
um we'll get better at this so yes we
will be doing this more any upcoming
audiobooks ooh i think dr james hoffman
is secretly writing a general sport
training book that is almost certainly
going to get an audio book and i would
really look into that i've got other
stuff in the works that i definitely
can't talk about but it's cool it's like
um
the death star but bigger
thank you for your question michael
charles rose bushes if that's your real
name i swear to god that's the greatest
name ever
says more leg annihilation specifically
squats
are poor athletes
when is that one video with the pro
hockey player guy
soon couple weeks
we've already filmed like i don't know
four months of training uh that's going
to be released
and more than a few of those videos are
like videos you might like not want to
watch around your kids because they're
just going to start crying because why
is that bald man hurting that nice young
man in his legs or that nice young girl
in her legs
and that's uh it's tough tough times
august 22nd so next monday a hockey
player dies next monday not this coming
the monday after
there will be a dead hockey player well
so okay this shit just skipped to like a
bunch okay here we go
all right last couple questions here
folks
asks what is the best way to bring
cortisol levels down
diet break and cardio break
cardio reduction
to maybe half of what you're doing
diet back to maintenance
multiple nights of good sleep
multiple days of maintenance eating
and those multiple days should also be
relatively low stress
the stress thing is fucking huge it's
critical and if you are not below 10
body fat your cortisol will come down
substantially if you're below 10 body
fat
just kind of grind away and finish and
then get the bug out
best of luck man the sleep and the low
stress is really really big
did you want to say something scott the
video guy uh apparently the more played
sports video was cool
allegedly that's what people are saying
cool isn't like he had a good time
ragging on my dumb ass or cool isn't
that much allegedly well thanks derek
i i always i think of you going to the
bank and uh he like gives them the id
and they catch a check and they're like
oh mr what plays more dates like that's
his last name does he have a last name
that we know about
wouldn't it be sweet if he just nobody
actually knew who he was
he's on joe rogan and joe's like so
what's your name he's like derek he's
like
more plates more dates like stinger
madonna stinger madonna man do i need a
nickname is dr mike my nickname that
sucks
jizz guy
that's a sweet name
i'm liking a super outfit like cheers
guy do your thing i'm like i can't i'm
afraid of crowds and i have small penis
[Music]
back to the super chat all right
leland
massaro damn leland i see your profile
pic flexing on us damn
35k daily steps
holy fuck
high intensity of her training for 75
minutes daily one to 1.5 hours of cardio
at just below tempo
pace running
155 ht
155 heart rate
225 pounds
at 8.5 body fat 125 grams of carbs from
veggies
uh est estimated on complete carb
estimates on complete carb deplete
fuck
three days
of only veggies and proteins and fats
and you've got no fucking carbs in you
at all maybe one day this is insane dude
yeah and then here's the thing if you
keep this remotely this
output up
the carb load to fully glycogen restore
you might have to be like five days of
1500 grams of carbs each time i've never
seen someone this active leland holy
fuck you're like a fucking superhero
like
was it jizz guy or jizz man
jizz guy
watch him
fail to
jizz does youtube cancel us for jokes
like that
this is okay
all right it's 20 22. jesus is fine
pablo z
asks how true is it
that close-toed shoes affect sport
performance do i need to worry about
wearing certain types of shoes to
prevent imbalances the imbalances thing
is almost certainly bullshit
shoes do affect your performance but i
think it has less to do with closed toed
and more like what kind of shoe you're
wearing
there's um
kind of like a
barefoot community barefoot training
advocates it's my estimate is that 20 of
them are very rational people giving you
really awesome real world advice that
really helps especially if you have foot
problems and then maybe 80 of them and
maybe i'm just being a dick and not
charitable which is totally possible or
like insane people
um i think that's every community
bodybuilding community
dr mike
himself 80 crazy
talking about himself in the third
person fuck did i just do that for him
anyway yeah i wouldn't worry about it
too much pablo but if you haven't foot
problems i think the barefoot community
can have some really great solutions for
you
just below that matt c says dr mike do
you remember me question matt see
pause
pause the live stream just kidding
matt see not only do we remember you
you have never been forgotten and never
will be
we literally you know what man
matt c tbh we have an arsenal smith
machine that like doesn't work well so
we're getting rid of it do you want it
i will legit pay shipping for you if you
take ownership of the machine and just
get a picture
of you with them using the machine and a
free smith machine and i know you're
going to say no because you hate it
to let the rest of you in on the joke
matt c was one of our earliest youtube
commentators and he just went for that
every time he used a smith machine you
guys are fucking idiots and dumb and
assholes and then every now and again he
said some nice shit and which would made
it made it nice we love you matt c you
are a fucking hero to us of course we
remember you we'll never forget
and i assume you actually look like
shaggy
from uh was that's your avatar
all right
all right next up is sharky
sharky asks what do we have to do to get
on one of your brutal training sessions
that get posted to youtube
well you know i'm not allergic to blow
jobs sharky
or am i um
it depends on where you live if you live
very far away from the united states
it's difficult
it depends on who you are in real life
if you're like a
psycho that's going to kill us all no
if you're jacked or lean that helps if
you're famous that also helps if we know
you in real life that helps
if you're on instagram
you know comment on one of my posts and
be like hey i was an asshole that
wanted to train on youtube
and um
you know if
if it's in the wherewithal and
if you live close enough or some shit
like that maybe we'll consider it but
tbh sharkey we are stacked full
for the foreseeable future of other
assholes that are going to need to
suffer
maybe there's a chance in the future
thank you for asking
jared feather just basically brings us
prose that i think he hates and then we
hurt them
on camera
all right
john handy
says hey dr mike third try fuck man all
right
how would
you best slash worst time
fat loss maintenance mass phase with the
mpt male physique template training
blocks
how would you best
okay
so
basically
i got stuff to okay so for the part of
it that's like
the maintenance part
always maintenance
for mesos one two and three you can do
fat loss no problem
you can do muscle gain no problem and
you can also do maintenance on meso one
but i wouldn't do maintenance on meso
two or on the metabolic measure
and i wouldn't do anything but
maintenance
on the
the recovery mezzo at the end
this will be posted to youtube it will
be saved
so if you need to come back john and
re-listen to that i promise you i said
all the true things
and if you listen to that it'll be you
can write it down and it'll be it'll be
true shit
um
in addition to that we have a few videos
on the rp youtube of timing your
nutrition to training and the general
principles from there you can apply to
the mpt just consider that mesos one two
and three are what we call hard training
hypertrophy training the fourth meso of
the the easy stuff is not hypertrophy
training it's maintenance only and then
meso one
can be a maintenance meso because it's
not super high volume but mesos two and
three are really saved only for fat loss
or muscle gain so
great question very very good question
all right next up is phil carter what a
great name
doctor since my contest prep finished
two months ago
off-plan meals are bringing me up to
five pounds plus and it doesn't go away
like it used to
any tips to get the one meal weight
increases back off 10 pounds up from
stage so first of all if you finish prep
two months ago ten pounds up from stage
is not a big deal second thing
after shows especially after the first
couple of shows you do this gets better
over time super mysterious mechanism i
have no fucking clue that works i'm sure
somebody does or will soon
your body gets really crazy sensitive to
food and to fucking getting um holding
body weight from that holding body water
rather
and the first time you start eating
remotely normally or off plan you just
gain a fuck load of weight because first
of all you're eating a lot and second of
all it's got salt and tons of carbs and
it's just the thing
and i noticed like even for the first
several months after my first prep i i
so here's what happened to me i did my
first prep
got abs
two days after the prep ended i didn't
have abs and i didn't see them again
until my next diet
the body water slowly leeched off while
the fat slowly put on at the same rate
literally months of body water reducing
really slowly so it seemed like it
doesn't do anything and then it just
replaced and then ended up just like not
having abs so it's a thing it's just
going to take time and i will say it
gets better every time you prep and you
can actually probably fix it once you
mass enough to where it's hard to eat
food and you're like oh i hate eating
take an active rest or maintenance phase
go into a mini cut
and the mini cut will clean your ass up
your body water handling will get better
and then you start slow healthy food
mostly messing up again it should be
much much less of a problem if it's a
problem even at all
all right
as well
how
i'm just fucking scrolling down
what the fuck
so framed
ask a question and they paid for this
like mike mike
comma
what day is it
question mark
wednesday
i kind of wouldn't have known otherwise
uh another good question is like what
year is it this is not my joke some
other comedian but like try just wearing
your underwear frazzle your hair up like
crazy in just a trench coat you could
get arrested or shot for this run into
like a a gas station that is like in the
middle of the night not a lot of people
go to and just run in and go
what year is it because they'll think
you're coming out of a time machine
or you'll get shotgunned to death don't
actually try this at home
brian livingston
hey yo dawg
new club family
thoughts on doing a video series about
the molecular processes of training
sliding filament theory how creatine
turns into atp etc
okay
so
that's all really good stuff you know i
wonder
i think i have some of that in videos i
used to make for class when i was a
professor at that general level
i wonder if i still have those videos
they're awful i used to be a shitty
public speaker
it's probably not something i'm going to
do
anytime soon and i'll tell you why these
are great great great topics
the thing is it seems that
there's lots of good places online to
get that kind of education already and
they have really cool infographics and
really cool like actual graphics and
scott the video guy he's a sex addict he
doesn't make graphics and um
i think other people can do that better
what i think i can do
pretty well the best i can do at
anything and certainly not the best in
the world
is teach
the
combination of science and practice
a little bit more towards the practical
end of getting you guys leaner and more
jacked and
maybe even some psychology thrown in
there occasionally
and that's probably what we're gonna
stick to only because of the opportunity
cost of not doing that i'll put it
another way
we have i have a list of
videos that we have to record
and then i have another list of
powerpoints i already made for those
videos
and then
we have a list of videos we've already
recorded
right now the list of videos we've
already recorded lasts how long scott
with six months
six months out on already recorded
videos those are done those are just
sitting in a dropbox and scott posts
them to youtube every now and again and
you can only post like
20 or 30 youtube videos ahead of time so
we do that
the powerpoints that i've made last
another six months on top of that
the list of videos topics and with many
outlines that i've made
is at our normal release rate of four
videos a week
is doped out to like six years from now
so
yeah we add other videos all the time
and sometimes new video topics slide in
we have so much fucking sport science to
teach you guys
um
that i don't know if it's in our
wherewithal to get into the basics
um because i think other people
comparatively um actually economics term
called comparative advantage i think
they have a better comparative advantage
than we do and our comparative advantage
is making this kind of bullshit
saying things like jizz guy a lot
why the fuck do you guys follow me at
all jesus
not funny i'm balding too much creatine
scott the video guy sucks
fucked up this live stream
jk
one more question and then we're out we
have one last member question fuck
is it from
john
yeah i knew you couldn't say that shit
john
last question pay rates hi
john is your last name
is so
easy to say in my jewish guy accent
that i can't say it any other way so pay
ritz it is i
john asks dr mike have you ever heard of
anyone isolating a muscle so much that
the supporting muscles are taken out
causing pain
snapping elbows hips etc
that would be fucking impressive i think
that's what happens if you get struck by
lightning like you can pull your bone
off with your bicep
electrocution also electricity
um
in real life you know technically
speaking you can contract your quad so
hard under max squat you can pull your
quad off the bone um
generally speaking
um i don't know if it's a matter of
isolating the muscle but it's imposing
tension on that system and something
breaks i did see a really nasty injury
once i'm going to say this if you're not
good with injury even descriptions just
mute the shit but i saw a video of a
girl
tear her adductor in the middle of a
squat and her knee just collapses in is
super super disturbing um so shit like
that definitely happens although i think
the most insane injury was when uh
jeff goldblum
in the fly
scott remember that shit oh yeah was
doing arm wrestling and he
uh broke a guy's fucking bone
uh in his wrist arm wrestling him
because he had his new fly powers after
the genetic discombobulation i will say
though it's some credit to jeff goldblum
because the fly powers clearly but
really that guy broke his own arm
because short of breaking your own arm
you could just do this
and if you're strong enough to snap your
own wrist that guy is a goddamn world
champion at a regular bar and whatever
fucking
fly city jeff goldblum is in
there's sorry like just one more and
then we're definitely done
said we missed his if you could get that
that's it
boom
all right
ahan shankwakar i'm sorry if i'm fucking
up your name your name is ballers fuck
also your quads look big as shit and
your doubts god damn that better be you
in that fucking profile picture or else
i'm complimenting some porn star or
something
do my reps have a benefit beyond saving
time
because aren't reps beyond 4ri are still
somewhat stimulative and don't straight
sets allow you to do more work so ahan i
i saw that exact question of yours
in the jared and mike youtube for
members and we answered it and that'll
be coming out in uh probably about a
week and a half but i'll hit you up
again here um
sometimes my reps have a better stimulus
to fatigue
and one of the things they do is for
sure save time but another thing they do
is allow you to have multiple approaches
to failure and to sequester a shitload
of metabolites
and because straight sets have so many
lead in reps before the hard reps start
for many muscles that's very effective
but for muscles that require shit load
of volume or muscles that clear
metabolites really fast muscles that are
difficult to fatigue a lot of times
myoreps have that exact specific ability
to hit so many approaches to failure
that it ends up being just better than
doing straight sets even if we equate
the volume of work marginally better but
i think better nonetheless
so that's my best um
best impersonation of someone that gives
good answers
i'm scrolling
scrolls off we're done should i say
goodbye to everybody
folks
i just saw one question out of the
corner of my eye
d weights 10 asks what's your opinion on
more plates more dates
um
i haven't seen a ton of his videos i
think i've seen like two and uh they
seem pretty cool he's super funny um and
he's just so goddamn good looking but
really i just put him on mute and just
stare
but uh yeah um i don't know i don't know
what else to say you know like yeah
there's no strong opinion whatsoever
folks
