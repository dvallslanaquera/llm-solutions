jerry jerry wants everything to make
sense
he don't like a joke
hey folks wednesday back day
no pm today just an am back we're gonna
start with some
version of a straight arm pull down to
get the lats in the mix nice and early
as they are the focus or at least part
of the focus
then we switch to a horizontal rowing
move
uh probably a barbell bent row or see if
we can rig something up here because we
like to do real big deficit rows
and then after that some kind of
vertical pulling move each of these for
anywhere between
three to five sets let's kick it
lat pull-downs or pull-overs however
people call them it's basically like a
pull-down except
your elbows are in a fixed position that
doesn't mean completely straight
whatever's comfortable whatever gets you
the best lat activation sometimes if you
straighten it out completely your
shoulders can hurt
your elbows can hurt you can feel it
more your triceps than your lats i like
a partially bent one
give some thought to what you like
experiment a little bit remember forward
too much it's good big stretch at the
top
peak contraction at the bottom you're
basically trying to take your fists
and put them just outside your hips
there's of course a variation whether
land again based on stimulus to fatigue
ratio
usually we do these in the 10 to 20 rep
range it's not a heavy exercise it's a
volume exercise
to get lots of stimulation specifically
to the
[Music]
[Music]
you're gonna be lats
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
hey man i think you overtrained
yesterday your legs look smaller
three's good on here yeah three three
three
yeah brother
barbell bent rose one of the kings of
the back movements
people think this exercise trains the
lats and they're not wrong
but they're leaving out a bunch of stuff
he trains the spinal directors it trains
the rhomboids trains the terrorist major
trains the traps
it trains everything the entire back all
at once we prefer to do our rows with a
huge deficit
so really far down to the ground it
minimizes how much external load we have
to use
huge stretch activates tons of
musculature the amount of weight we're
using is very very humbling
however it is highly effective give it a
shot make sure your lower back
never rounds a whole lot your mid back
hand a little bit lower back is straight
no cheating no swinging we're gonna do
this in the oh
5 to 15 rep range let's go for it
folks we got three sets of bat rose in
which is good
i think i need about one more set of
stimulus for sort of my desired hit for
today
but unfortunately the reps are starting
to dwindle started at 14
then i hit two sets of 11 repetitions i
don't want to get below 10 and i will
because of fatigue
below 10 is fine generally anything
about 5 is fine but for
the rows i get a better stimulus to
fatigue ratio generally if i spend a
little bit more time generating
tension there was sufficiently high
level of tension that we had for the
heavier loading
the time won't be sufficiently long the
fatigue won't be as good
the stimulus to fatigue ratio might not
be as good in my particular case
so what i'm going to do is take the
weight down
to a load that allows me more time
spent generating tension which is to say
more repetitions something like back up
to 15.
one more set's probably good enough for
me to finish the stimulus off it's
lighter
but the effect is still there because
we're still pushing it close to failure
what do you think about the pull-down
segment maybe they'll learn to do
watching a pro do
lat pull downs i'm gonna say i'm a pro
i'm a pro all right folks pull downs
three to four sets here last exercise
just more stimulus for the lats and all
the other vertical pulling musculature
tears major etc
um pull downs can be a great exercise
probably don't want to do them first in
a program unless you're weak like me
uh do pull-ups first this is pull-ups
pull-downs are great
at the end of a workout when you're a
little bit fatigued can't lift your body
weight anymore but you still want a
really good stimulus
range of motion as always teamful rom
uh most people will get really really
good pumps sensations contractions
stimulus
if they go all the way down as close to
the chest as they can
ideally touching the chest for
standardization and of course a big full
stretch at the top
i lean back a little bit on my pull-ups
it's the only way i can touch my chest
and also get a better feeling in the
muscle so i'm not swinging it's not
momentum
it's just better positioning for better
stimulus to fatigue ratio otherwise my
shoulders hurt
all kinds of weird stuff does that mean
you should be leaning back probably not
do whatever works best for you within
the confines of standardized good
technique
and we have a video on rp youtube
right here about what standardized
technique really means so give that a
look
let's get these pull downs done and then
maybe we can find true happiness
maybe not probably not there's a lot of
talk in the intro about not swinging
you tell me
[Music]
now swinging the technique
really good
[Music]
