it's almost a guarantee that if you got
two people to perform the same training
program they would get different results
why is this
genetics nutrition and sleep may be some
factors that instantly come to your mind
and all of these are unquestionably
valid but another probably
underappreciated factor is the
psychological stress levels experienced
by a person
psychological stress is the emotional
stress within your mind
there are probably an infinite number of
ways you could describe psychological
stress from persistent feelings of fear
anxiety anger resentment frustration
grief sadness and so on and so forth
most of the people watching this video
are probably well aware of one form or
another of psychological stress
but how does psychological stress relate
to building muscle and strength
oftentimes we may simplify training
for example in the two-factor fitness
model training stimulates fitness and
fatigue once fatigue diminishes your
performance increases
however remember we're talking about the
human body an extraordinarily complex
machine
your brain contains around 86 billion
neurons and at any given second in time
one estimate suggests there are 37 with
21 zeros reactions taking place in your
body
thus
it's clear to see simplifying training
and its response is not easy
the fact is your mind interacts with
your physiology we saw last video that
they may believe you're taking anabolic
steroids when you are actually not
skyrockets your strength gains
in this video we'll be exploring how
psychological stress impacts recovery
after a training session your long term
strength and muscle gains and then we'll
wrap up with a brief mention on methods
to potentially reduce psychological
stress
[Music]
let us first examine how psychological
stress impacts your recovery after a
training session
this study had 210 students in
resistance training classes complete a
test to determine their perceived levels
of stress
that is how much stress do they feel
they have
ultimately 31 individuals were recruited
18 of them had results indicating they
were low stressed individuals while 13
of them had results indicating they were
highly stressed individuals
now these subjects again completed the
test to redetermine their perceived
levels of stress to ensure the results
had not changed
additionally they did a test to
determine the number of stressful life
events taking place
thus each subject not only had their
perceived stress score but also a life
event stress score the subjects
performed a highly intense training
session it consisted of a ramping phase
and burning phase all of the training
was done on the leg press
the ramping phase had the subjects
perform a set of 10 reps with
progressively heavier weights until they
worked up to a weight with which 10 reps
could not be completed
two minutes of rest was given between
these sets
three minutes after this they moved onto
the burning phase
this consisted of performing six sets of
repetitions to volitional failure with
three minutes of rest between sets
on the first set they used a low that
could be performed for a maximum of 10
repetitions
this load was of course established from
the ramping phase
the second set had them reduce this load
by ten percent and if the subjects could
perform more than ten reps on their set
they kept training with this load
throughout set three to six if not they
used a twenty percent lighter load on
the remaining sets
before this training session the
researchers measured maximal isometric
muscle force muscle soreness subjective
fatigue and subjective energy
all of these measures were retested one
hour 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours and 96
hours after the training session
what were the findings
higher stressed individuals as measured
by both the perceived and life event
stress measures took longer to recover
their maximal isometric muscle force
looking at the data low stressed
individuals recovered within 48 hours
while the highly stressed individuals
just about recovered within 96 hours
which is double the time
energy fatigue and soreness also took
longer to return to baseline in the
highly stressed individuals as measured
by life event stress
perceived levels of stress did not have
an effect on soreness or fatigue scores
but it did have an effect on energy such
that highly stressed individuals with
this score took longer for their energy
levels to return to baseline
it's worth mentioning that before the
intense training session all the
measurements were similar between the
highly moderately and low stressed
individuals moreover all these subjects
performed similar workloads and saw
similar max and average heart rate
responses so differences in before
measurements or differences in training
effort cannot explain the results we've
overviewed
thus the data demonstrates strongly that
stress both perceived and life event
stresses interfere and prolong your
recovery durations
[Music]
how does psychological stress impact
long-term muscle and strength gains
for this we have this study
81 men and 54 women were recruited the
subjects were classified as either low
stressed or high-stressed individuals
based on a test that incorporated both
life event stress and their perceived
stress impacts
all subjects trained these exercises
twice per week for 12 weeks
there were three mesocycles throughout
the 12 weeks the first four weeks was a
hypertrophy cycle where these training
variables were used the second four
weeks was a strength cycle with these
training variables while the last four
weeks was a power cycle with these
variables
it was found bench press and squat
strength gains as measured by one rep
max were greater for the low stress
versus high stressed individuals
increases in upper arm and thigh
circumference were not statistically
different between the low and
high-stressed individuals
however the percentages do appear to
favor the low-stressed individuals
speaking very non-scientifically
i think this could be a real difference
that the study was just underpowered to
find but at the same time it could just
be due to chance
it's also worth pointing out that
circumference is a very indirect measure
of muscle growth if more direct measures
of muscle growth such as ultrasound or
mri was used perhaps we would see a
difference between the low and high
stressed individuals but this is me
speculating
nevertheless at the least this study
indicates psychological stress
interferes with strength gains
[Music]
based on the data overviewed it appears
psychological stress can extend recovery
durations and impair long-term
adaptations
it's worth also noting that other data
indicates highly stressed individuals
are more susceptible to illnesses and
injuries
thus you're going to want to do your
utmost to minimize stress we'll discuss
some potential things that can help
shortly but i also want to discuss
another potential takeaway from this
video
that is there are cases where
psychological stress is unpredictable
and uncontrollable
in events like these given stress will
negatively influence your recovery and
adaptability it might be best to go easy
with your training or give yourself a
break
remember muscle memory is real humans
and other animals too have an
accelerated ability to regain loss
strength and muscle
so training breaks or periods of light
training should not worry you
moreover there's some potential reason
to believe training breaks at least may
be beneficial for re-sensitizing your
anabolic pathways but i'll save this for
another video
anyway let us detail some potential ways
to minimize psychological stress
the first potential way is via
practicing meditation
now there are numerous different forms
of meditation but i think pretty much
all of them can reduce psychological
stress
the literature suggests meditation can
reduce activity of the amygdala
sometimes called the brain fear center
and even potentially reduce the size of
the amygdala in the long term while
concurrently increasing gray matter in
the brain regions involved in learning
memory processing and emotion regulation
furthermore a meta-analysis on nearly 1
300 adults found meditation may decrease
anxiety with the strongest effects seen
for those with the most anxiety
the second potential way to reduce
psychological stress is through breath
work
there are numerous types of breathing
exercises that can help it's worth
noting that when you breathe in your
heart rate increases while when you
breathe out your heart rate decreases
so breathing in a way that results in
you exhaling more than you inhale can be
a great way to induce relaxation and
calmness
one real time tool is the double inhale
followed by a long exhale i first heard
about this from andrew hubermann it
seems to be a great way to instantly
help relieve some stress
moving on from the literature there's
evidence diaphragmatic breathing
sessions also called belly breathing
where you focus on deep inhales followed
by long slow exhales can increase
attention abilities enhance well-being
and reduce cortisol levels
cortisol is also known as the stress
hormone
the third potential way is to spend time
in nature there's evidence visiting
natural environments can be beneficial
in reducing both physical and
psychological stress levels
of course depending on where you live
spending time in nature isn't always
viable
another fourth potential way is just to
walk more it's evident humans were
designed to move and be active and we
thrive when we do so higher daily step
counts even potentially more than 10 000
daily steps have been associated with
lower risks of dying from all causes
moreover higher daily steps have been
associated with lower anxiety depression
anger fatigue confusion and total mood
distress scores
of course
these are only a few of the numerous
ways one could go about relieving stress
and different individuals have their own
preferences and methods to deal with
stress
but i hope at least some of the info
detailed here can be of use to you
until next time
