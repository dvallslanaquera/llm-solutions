[Music]
stop the video guy
[Music]
I'm Dr Mike for Renault sound
spiritualization this is your feather
ifb Pro also for Renaissance
periodization and look it's Jenna Geary
and she's back for the 80th time on this
channel the drama folks can't get enough
of this and and then I'm saying
mommy you looking
straight super hot fire up here would
you say pink and black 169.4 169 not
only is that a jacked-ass weight
you got 69 right in that way did you
plan that you play too much bro
unbelievable all right
the good news is
Jen's gonna be dating a lot the bad news
is she won't have the use of her arms
during those dates because we're gonna
smash her arms up right now your arms
look pretty big but they can always be
bigger I never
let's fix it
[Music]
free motion curls are up first we're
using maybe the world's first ever free
motion machine but God damn it it still
works we are going to do sets of 10 to
20 reps on the free motion and we're
probably gonna buy a rep match the shits
which means whatever she gets on that
first set Road close to failure rest and
normal a lot of time however many many
sets it takes to reach that number again
and again and again four sets in a row
so let's say she gets 16 reps in the
first set that means second set let's
say she gets 12. failure rest of that a
little bit don't go anywhere another
four to get to 16 then 16 then 16. heane
is on the menu and Jen is the meal no
swinging
there you go
14 one more slow
stretch at the bottom hold it for a
second
stretch up come on yeah
slow
and that's it edging very good very
good very good very good oh our goal is
15. and we're gonna add a note boom
so we're going to take Jenna we're going
to move her down off the machine a
little bit in front so she gets more of
an intense stretch on the bottom that
super stretch of the very far end of the
range of motion with a ton of tension is
really really good for muscle growth but
it's bad for how Jen's gonna feel it's
that two 15 reps is the goal let's hit
it
yep three
control two mortal almost there
four amazing slow
nice and smooth no explosive
forward in forward yeah hell yeah Jen
slow
Big Stretch as if another as if another
rack

audible yeah minus a set you can show
them add reduced that feature
oh God they hurt so bad
I'm talking about painful memories from
your childhood or your biceps that too
I don't really have a lot of memories
we're gonna make an audible here that's
a shitload of overload a lot of stimulus
a lot of damage for one exercise we're
gonna go into the next exercise and so
we're gonna get our handy dandy RP
training app out and then we're gonna
say okay we got first set we got the
second set we got the third set
 all that on the fourth set now it's
time to go on and do barbell curls oops
with an arrow grip
[Music]
almost in and forward

so you want to push them in towards each
other like the supinate go ahead girl
and and
yeah really
we're just warming up again let's try it

that's absolutely the working way yeah
holy all right good no I'm not I
don't know help me I'm not good this is
a 35 pound bar though why 35.
second exercise the biceps are
pre-cooked already from three sets of
the Free Motion curls now it is easy bar
curls
probably sets of 10 to 15. this is Jared
technique one of our YouTube viewers uh
one of our channel members I believe
recommended to be called Jerry curls
which is not really that far off and
we're gonna be doing three sets of these
10 to 15 reps watch the technique on
this elbows are going to be super close
in together
is going to be up and the slow eccentric
almost comes out in front as much as
down to give you a crazy psychotic
stretch this exercise if bees had knees
it would compose their very knee
ligaments think that through let's get
going I was in a foreign
slow
as if another
oh
hey slow
and Georgia Georgia
yeah that's it nine vitamins relax and
rest okay don't come down just stand

just no it's not
ah I can't
this is pathetic
what is going on
beauty is pain
I say there's a good and a Unity Yang to
crying during the workout
the bad part is it's sad it's sad
the good part is
runny makeup

yeah I'm not gonna say I was enjoying it
for that I might cry right now good

beautiful rack oh man that was so good
oh that was so good oh I got those
 up
she gets angry you you all
whoa I mean these people had nothing to
do with it them
missing this I don't know what to
do
it really I hear that I get it
for the biceps as a whole
this is funny low pump moderate pump or
amazing pump is there one above that no
but we'll just have to say amazing
[Music]
okay folks biceps are done it's tricep
time overhead Easy Bar extensions we're
going to be focusing on keeping the
elbows in it's okay to flare the elbows
but then it turns a little bit more of a
press not the worst thing in the world
but not ideal if you take the elbows and
push them in the front belts can't
really contribute to the movement it's
more of an extension rather than a press
we're going to be doing very strict
especially elbows in on the way down on
the way up it's okay if they come out a
little bit but on the way down is really
really critical deep stretch every time
sets of probably 10 to 20 more like 10
to 15 destruction once those are done
we're gonna finish off the whole thing
with a bunch of push-up super sets then
I thank God right now that I'm not the
one doing it let's get into it
