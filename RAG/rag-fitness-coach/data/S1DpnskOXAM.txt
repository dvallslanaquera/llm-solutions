hey folks I'm Dr Mike for Renaissance
peritization and I'm here to deliver to
you from high on the mountain The
Ultimate Guide to cheat meals aren't you
glad you clicked on our
thumbnail of what make the thumbnails
much later than these videos so probably
someone eating a whole mess of delicious
tasty food you sure are because you're
gonna get some science layered with
Oodles of sugar and fat
you cheating mother beep I've just
gotten into BB myself recently because
YouTube will
uh do not not nice things if you swear
especially early because children could
be watching but I guess children have a
really small attention span so after 30
seconds they don't care in any case
a couple of things to say really seven
point number one
what is the purpose of cheating
the purpose of a cheat food
is to do two things
one is the thing they do and two is the
constraint
thing one is to make you happy that's
right cheat meals are just to deliver
pleasure Sensations to you
that's what they do but
they are only useful and allowed quote
unquote in the context that they are
still in line with your goals they do
not screw up your goals
that's the two-factor thing about cheat
meals
they're fun and they're still in line
with your goals
the purpose and makes them okay to do
now Point number two is that cheats can
be useful it's not just fun stuff that
doesn't screw up your goals
though it has to be for sure those two
things it can also be a third
in the context of maintaining your body
weight cheat meals are just fun things
that don't make you gain weight in the
grand context
if you're bulking if you're massing if
you're muscle gaining if you're trying
to gain weight and muscle on purpose
cheat meals can help by a small margin
add a few easy extra calories per week
so that you gain weight on the track
that you wanted so cheat meals have that
utility
now notice I didn't say that cheat meals
can bump up your metabolism or give you
a metabolic boost or be used as refeeds
that's all fucking nonsense and it
doesn't pan out in the literature nor
does it pan out experientially chickens
are profoundly not for those things but
I'll get to that a little bit
cheat meals are potentially useful for
increasing how much food you're eating
and getting you to your calories and to
point number three
cheat meals do a few things very poorly
and some things people try to replace
them with but that doesn't work so well
cheat meals
cannot replace a foundation of healthy
fuel for performance and Recovery food
so if you're having trouble gaining
weight but you're eating a crap diet
with missed meals and not enough carbs
cheat meals are a poor solution to that
problem
that's like trying to weld together two
pieces of Steel that are three inches
apart fucking Christ you're going to
need a lot of welding and it's going to
make the steel really flimsy because you
can only weld so much
a foundation of lots of healthy food
lean meats
veggies
fruits whole grains refined grains
and healthy fats should be there meal by
meal day by day and then a few times a
week two to three times a week in most
cases at most I would say you can layer
in some cheat meals and that's totally
good but if you're trying to cheat your
way through a bulk and have mostly cheat
meals or way too many cheat meals and
not enough clean healthy food that's not
going to work out for you from a health
perspective from a money perspective
because cheat meals usually cost more
money and from a performance perspective
because you will tell with your own
performance if you eat mostly healthy
food you're a fucking animal in the gym
if you eat too much cheat food too much
junk food it starts to wear down on you
a little bit
cheat meals also are very bad at
elevating your metabolism and reigniting
the fire people say that 99 times out of
100 to justify having tasty food because
it feels good look if you had me make up
a reason why porn is amazing
motherfucker I'd have a thousand reasons
to boost dopamine I think a serotonin
I'm sure it does something bad too and
shit it's a great form of uh preventing
Global overpopulation but the real
reason the porn is sweet is because
it makes me feel good not me of course
I'm not a derelict who does that sort of
thing but you definitely you
it turns out cheat meals just really
don't have a place in the context of a
fat loss diet in most cases
they don't boost your metabolism for any
longer than the meal it takes to digest
they sure should do when it's digesting
but also you're digesting fucking Oodles
of carbs and fats that your metabolism
goes up you add this much food you still
gain weight on that balance and then
nothing happens a day or two or three
later that your body can remember so to
speak so if you have one cheat meal a
week it doesn't boost your metabolism
for the rest of the week that's nonsense
that shit died seven or eight years ago
in the scientific literature
which brings us to point number four
if you are craving cheats and you're
having a tough time losing weight
and you're still doing one weekly or two
weekly cheats
and you love the food you overeat it
like crazy I'll get to what I mean by
overeating
and you start to get in the the
situation where you like can't wait for
the cheats to happen when they do you
eat them mindlessly
after they're done you get depressed
because you won't be cheating for long
and it's interfering with your weight
loss I've been there by the way cheating
is fucking stupid
I wouldn't even go so far as to say in
almost all fat loss diet context just
eat more Whole Food it'll keep you
Fuller for longer it won't tempt you
with this thing that you can't even have
much of junk food
just keep the junk away when you're fat
loss dieting for the most part or
entirely cheat meals are really really
stupid if you're trying to use them for
fat loss to reinvigorate your metabolism
if it's just making you miserable
if we are using cheat meals
and you're doing a maintenance phase of
dieting or a muscle gain phase of
dieting how many cheats do we program
per week one cheat meal a day is kind of
a lot
but I think it's pretty reasonable to do
two to three or one to three cheat meals
per week I think that's totally fine
zero is also Fine By the way you don't
have to cheat but one two or three meals
per week is great and there is a timing
as to when to actually eat the cheat
meals if you want to get really nerdy
and really pedantic with just like the
whole fucking reason our Channel exists
so here you go
if
we're calling a cheat meal something
that has tasty feel good fun Foods nine
times or eight times out of ten it'll be
loaded with both protein and especially
a fuck load of carbs but especially a
shitload of fat
that means if you eat your cheat meal
pre-workout you're an insane person
that's just gonna throw up the entire
workout
if you eat the cheat meal right after
the workout ideally we want a fast
digesting carbohydrate source with lower
levels of fat so that that food can get
into your bloodstream into your muscles
as quickly as possible to potentiate
recovery and growth so we actually don't
want to cheat right after workout so
when people finish their last demo if
they're like dug in time for pancakes
and eggs and toast and shit like that
like yeah brother I'm like ah the sport
nutritionist in me is like oh no
so what I would say is best to do is two
things
one save your cheat meals for one or two
meals after the workout you have your
workout
come home you have half a fucking
container of kids sugary cereal bunch of
skim milk and a whey protein shake
after that two three hours later it's
cool to go hit your cheat meal
especially if your cheat meal is like
maybe all you can eat sushi or something
a little bit lower on the fats higher on
the carbs but if you're gonna go out for
burger and fries or some shit like that
I would say it's best to save a cheat
meal even for two meals after the
workout so your first high carb super
sugary meal wait two hours or something
have a bunch of chicken and rice and
veggies or whatever wait two or three
hours and then have your cheat meal
that's probably best and I said two
things the second thing and the last
thing for this part is cheat meals
are also what a lot of people call going
out to eat and they're supposed to be
fun so I think it's probably best to
have them during fun social times
because they can increase your cohesion
with Society you don't need bodybuilders
and fitness types to get ostracized even
more than they are today a pretend
you're an old person and go have a cheat
meal with a friend is what I'm trying to
say which means
Friday night
Saturday midday or brunch or whatever
Saturday night and then Sunday for
brunch or lunch or something like that
these are really good times in most
cultures for most people to have their
cheat meals it'd be really weird if
you're at the office and they let you
eat at the office you've got like two
pizzas and a shitload of Diet Cokes and
a thing of cookies and uh you're doing
operations engineering and you're eating
a slice of pizza and someone's like hey
Jim like hey what's up wow
with uh celebrating something by
yourself at your desk
it's cheat meal man you know that
Wednesday's 3 P.M like
okay okay
Jim do you have a family to go to you're
fucking looking at it brother two large
pizzas is my family
oh
okay yeah Jim I'll be uh
if you need me I won't be at my desk I'm
leaving
that's fucking weird hey if that's you
I feel you get some friends
I don't know how to get friends I still
don't have any uh watch this uh Scott
the video guy are we friends
ah as long as you keep paying me friend
for pay
wow
in any case yeah try to have real
friends or even fuck your friends man
you don't need friends drive over Friday
night at 8pm to the Taco Bell
people working in the drive-through
they're your real friends because they
guarantee you happiness
twice once is when you eat the food
the second time is at 3 00 a.m when you
wake up and shit and blood is I'm just
kidding I was gonna take that example an
analogy way too far
imagine soaked sheets I'm gonna stop
the plumber passes out honestly I need
to just quit
your wife leaves you I'm done I swear
I'm done
your dog dies how can that even happen
by the smell alone
seriously enough time to go back to
cheat meals
all right
so we got that out of the way point
number six
what kinds of foods make the best cheat
meals people actually ask this I'll say
a couple things about it first
just enjoy the food it doesn't fucking
matter
holy shit overthinking ass crazy
motherfuckers and I'm one of them and I
overthought it and the final conclusion
was it doesn't really fucking matter
that being said
tying in to point number seven is how to
avoid overeating we'll get to that in a
sec but first
whatever you're gonna cheat with it just
has to have one rule the big rule make
sure it has some protein in it because
while you're eating for pleasure and
you're raising your blood levels of fats
and carbs like crazy when your muscle
cells get to being like oh shit time to
grow we got this food but if you don't
present a lot of protein with that your
muscles can't really grow much and then
they're just your body fats like oh hell
yeah it's my party and then it grows
that's no good so if your cheat meal is
just a shitload of Oreos
and Netflix by yourself of course
remember try to cry off to the side
because you're lonely as fuck and your
life is pointless don't cry into the
Oreos because the tears don't mix with
the Oreo shit super well
add a fucking protein shake into that
get you to Walmart
buy you a fucking big ass container of
fair life skim milk
that was some Oreos holy shit that's
growth juice right there that's growth
Fuel and if you're really pathetic after
you eat a sleeve and a half of Oreos
pour the milk into the rest of the shit
and eat it with a spoon like the
pathetic lonely animal that you are and
I am can we be friends
so make sure you have protein with it
you know um how much protein I'll give
you a great answer the same amount you
eat with a normal meal or about one and
a half to two times that amount
why one and a half to two times that
amount is even better than just the one
time because the amount of calories
you're having in a cheat meal is
generally like two times the amount of
calories you'll have in any of your one
normal meals
and that means that that food is going
to digest for much longer and you're
going to need amino acids paired with
that digestion the entire time which
means if you're eating more food eat
more protein now a lot of times you
don't need extra protein shakes because
if you get like a meat lover's pizza it
has like a fucking 150 grams of protein
in this shit I know it was at 180 grams
of fat or whatever but hey you signed up
for the shit so it's absolutely totally
cool to just have you know burgers and
all that Sushi whatever you're eating
pasta but make sure it has plenty of
protein if it doesn't have a protein
shake or some skim milk or something
like that with
lastly
how do you avoid overeating on cheats it
is totally possible first of all what do
we consider overeating on cheese
I'm going to pull this number exactly
and only out of my anus but I promise
it'll make sense thank you brain for
being able to tell stories that
rationalize stupid bullshit on the spot
make believe here we go
if you eat
much more
per day
than about oh one and a third of the
calories you normally do
the probability that a ton of that food
goes to body fat it is already topped
off your glycogen stores your anabolic
pathways are fully completely saturated
the probability goes up
so what I'm saying is the following
if you typically eat
4 000 calories a day
on your cheat meal days
the whole day probably shouldn't get
much over 6 000 calories it's totally
cool if it does if you're okay with the
added body fat game
but if you want to keep body fat a
little bit hemmed in and still have some
fun just make sure that the entire day
doesn't take you over one and a third of
what you normally eat so four thousand
to six thousand that's reasonable but if
you haven't fucking cheat meal on a
Saturday and you go back and look at the
numbers you're like oh I had 18 000
calories today guess that shouldn't add
literally pounds of body fat to your
frame in one fucking day and yes that is
how it works
your ability to put on body fat is
immensely impressive
I would use that rule of thumb the one
and a third thing last totally cool more
cool but if you get over one and a half
one and two-thirds double your daily
calories in the total food healthy food
earlier in the day cheat meal later it
starts to get to be a bit like are you
sure you want to get that fat in one
fucking coat
does that mean you can reduce your
calories early in the day it can but
careful with that you don't want to
start eating very little in the day
after work out you're like no
post-workout meal today for me man I
gotta save up for my cheat meal later
Jesus Christ so here's a rule I use I
use a combined rule one is I do a good
job of eating lots of Whole Food
through the day
maybe I go easier on the fats
I'm down 500 calories or three or four
hundred calories below what I would be
otherwise
and then my last two meals of the day
instead of eating them
I just have one big ass cheat meal
combined with that extra three or four
calories that I saved for not going
crazy on the fats earlier that day and
then voila that brings me well below
that one and one-thirds number and
everything is super happy hunky dory now
the last thing I'll say
is if that was a lot of math for you and
you're like Jesus Christ you're moving
food here and there and fucking counting
fuck that shit I 100 agree with you
so maybe for cheating three times a week
try to keep the cheats relatively
reasonable and hemmed in two of those
times but one time a week especially if
you're not in a place where it's right
post contest and you're able to shove 10
000 calories in your face if you're
cheating it's just some fun shit that
you do when you're right around one and
a third of your normal calories or
somewhere close just cheat enjoy the
food have some fucking protein enjoy
your life make sure what you're ordering
extra sushi rolls all you can eat sushi
place you do it with your mouth full of
food
so that the waitress can stab a picture
of you in the back because she fucking
hates you and you're there every Friday
and that's literally me
Miss waitress from that one sushi place
don't poison my food but if you do it's
been fun and if I don't make another
YouTube video I died getting poisoned as
she was the name Sushi uh report that
shit to the police anyway folks do you
have any other questions about cheat
meals if you do
there is a comments section exactly for
your questions I'm going to try to give
their personally an answer a few and if

I can't answer them on text very
efficiently we'll make more videos about
