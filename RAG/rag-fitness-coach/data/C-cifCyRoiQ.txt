hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization today's video
is a little bit different
um i was recently invited by mark and or
mark bell and sema on to the mark bell
power project podcast that's a whole lot
to say at once
in order to sort of give some pushback a
little bit of a debate
to uh joel seidman
who is kind of a sport performance
specialist and a big deal on instagram
and he has tons of videos of training
athletes and a lot of the training is
really unstable surfaces
really unstable positions for feet and
hands
really interesting bar types and a lot
of very very partial ranges of motion he
has all sorts of justifications and
reasons for this
and i was brought on to chat with him on
very short notice actually 20 minutes
before he was on they texted me
and
they wanted me to sort of
because you know i'm mr full rom and
sports science and all that stuff they
wanted me to see if i could push back at
him a little bit and ask him some
pointed questions and and get the debate
going
uh it worked from their perspective
because i got a lot of views on that
video which is awesome it was very
interesting and i did get to ask him a
few questions and they were very kind to
let me sort of ask all the questions
that i had on hand at the time and he
did absolutely answer every single
question
and
to his answers i didn't say much in
general
for a variety of reasons mostly because
i wanted to get through the questions
and also
because
the whole confrontational and just
telling people they're wrong to their
face thing
it kind of tends to backfire sometimes i
did that once back in the day to good
old greg ducette
and i was you know apparently very mean
to him and people just hated that for
some reason
and it didn't matter that you know it is
probably a nine to one ratio of me being
correct and him incorrect on that
it sort of drew people away from that
and i i tend to agree with that and
actually before that video had ever been
made i wrote a vast amount of literature
made vast numbers of videos
about how arguing to convince us
different than our game to win and are
going to make someone to look bad so i
wasn't going to do that
to joel seidman and it's also like you
know he's a human being it's just not
nice to to be like well i think you're
dumb or i think you're wrong
so i didn't say a whole lot
about my specific positions and the
nuance of them i didn't say a whole lot
about his responses
so
a lot of folks kind of made those
comments in the video like oh like you
know dr michael only said like three
things
and i wonder what he thinks about all
this and what kind of responses he would
have
to joel cedrin's uh thoughts on that so
we'll throw a link in for you to watch
that video it's like 20 25 minutes long
it's pretty entertaining
and then if you want to come back to
this video or just watch this video
first
a little bit better context if you watch
that one first
and then see maybe if i can fill in some
blanks and this way like a bit more
learning happens because there's some
really cool takeaways that i think we
can all uh sort of learn from so
here in this video i'll sort of
do some paraphrasing of his various
position stances take it all in good
faith as usual
and give my take on what i think about
them and i'm not gonna try to be
intentionally mean or poisonous or any
of that but i'll be a little bit more
unreal than i was there mostly because
we have the time here
also because it's kind of rude to do
that somebody's face
not that i have any misgivings about
that but it's just not a nice thing to
do and also because here i can sort of
go on my own little rants
uh teach the message that i think is
relevant and then you guys in the
comments can tell me if i'm wrong
an idiot or some combination of being a
wrong idiot so here we go
variety of claims made these aren't
necessarily an order in which you make
some of the video uh but uh i thought
that you know i got most of the claims
that apologies if i missed any by the
way so one of the claims is generally
something like 90 degree
uh joint angles
especially at the shoulder joint i think
and maybe some others including the knee
joint
or reduce or prevent inflammation which
uh
joel seidman sees is a bad thing
uh i'll be flat out
i i just in case
you're not filled in i have a phd in
sport physiology which is a science of
taking good athletes and making them
better i've worked with tons of pretty
good athletes
the entire time i was in school and for
a long time after i've been a professor
of sport science for a long time
currently professor sports science
and uh i gotta be honest um
there's no precedent on which this makes
a whole lot of sense to me maybe i'm
missing something
but
inflammation generally occurs
as a result of both improper and proper
training
and if the joint structures and tissues
are healthy they go through the
inflammatory cycle they finish the
inflammatory cycle and you can train
again
if they're unhealthy or something
deleterious has occurred the
inflammatory cycle generally tends to
either continue or spirals out of
control into further escalating
inflammation
and the range of motion you use
doesn't
link to that in any linear sense
and
as a matter of fact
we could push the point a little further
and say that
if you're using the loads that would be
effective
90 degrees the external load has to be
so high
that
the chances for something moving the
wrong way and actually causing some
deleterious inflammation is probably
higher like if you only ever go to 90 in
your shoulder presses versus coming all
the way down you have to use a lot more
weight that transfers more force into
your elbows your shoulders your spinal
column especially uh and all that other
stuff and not to say that's a bad thing
inflammation is fine when it's in the
context of something that can be
recovered from
but it certainly doesn't make a whole
lot of sense that 90 degrees is somehow
specifically
i wouldn't say anti-inflammatory but
non-inflammatory
and
you know if there's something in the
athlete's injury history
that
makes it so that 90 degrees is the
lowest they can descend before having to
return
because they would otherwise sort of
impinge on a certain issue that's a very
different claim than just everyone gets
less inflamed training at 90 degrees
which
if i had to put money on it i would say
is uh
uh how do i say this politely
i was gonna say by no means clear i can
probably make a
more
more pointed statement
doesn't make any sense to me
uh it might make sense but sure as hell
doesn't mean you know i'm not you know
the smartest guy in the world probably
one of the dumbest actually but i had a
lot of education so maybe i missed
something in biomechanics in any case
that's first point
on to the next
uh i sort of
uh paraphrased a position that has been
made popular by nis over toes guy
recently
that
one of the best ways to prevent injury
in the future is to build a lot of
strength
through extreme ranges of motion or at
least through pertinent ranges of motion
so if you do let your for example knees
go over your toes in various forms of
squats your chances of hurting your
knees when they do do that in a variety
of sport and recreational settings is
very low because you've built a lot of
strength and resiliency literally
adapting to that position under high
stress in a controlled environment
and
sort of to that end so i kind of put
this forward and said wouldn't we want
athletes to descend way below 19 squats
for example or get full range of motion
in the shoulder joints so so much that
it didn't cause any kind of pain or
damage
because it's going to make the athlete
stronger on these extreme joint angles
and thus better at their sports when
they do enter them like you know if
you're doing jiu jitsu or wrestling or
even basketball you land weird if you're
really strong in weird positions or
extreme ranges of motion you're probably
not going to get hurt nearly as much as
you would get hurt if you were not used
to them you were cutting everything at
90 degrees
and
his response was something to the effect
of well you know we already do full
range of motion in sport training
so why should we do a full range of
motion in the gym
and the answer to that which i didn't
give because i was out of politeness and
out of courtesy for everyone's time and
not to make it back and forth because
that's really stupid um
you know we do full range of motion with
loaded implements in the gym so that we
become stronger for sport that's
actually the only reason we're in the
gym as athletes
is to become stronger and more powerful
and more capable in a way that uh sport
training doesn't supply enough high
quality consistent forces in those
positions to be a meaningful training
stimulus right it's kind of like if
you're preparing for a trip to france
that's like two weeks long and you want
to be pretty conversational you can do
one of two things you can practice
conversational french and learn it with
one of those like little like
you know apps or something so when you
get to france for two weeks you can
pretty get along much better or you can
say fucking i'll be in france anyway and
i'll just learn the shit when i'm there
well yeah but that means you blow dicks
in french for the first week and the
second you sort of started to pick some
shit up and then your you got your
passport slapped on the table at us
customs and you're coming back and
you're like i guess i know some french
now but it's kind of pointless just the
same way we can train athletes in the
weight room to have this unreal solid
base of injury reduction and performance
enhancement on the field or mat or court
of play or we could just let the field
or matter court handle it i'm not really
sure why i would do that the field or
matt of court or court they're really
good for the technical specifics you
can't train in the gym
the actual sport moves themselves being
able to shuffle and move and shoot the
ball and do volleyball stuff and
wrestling things and that stuff you
can't train in the weight room because
it's a fucking weight room with weights
you don't throw a basketball that
bounces off one of the 90s and hits
someone in the face that's not the place
for that but it is the place for making
tissues and structures and general
physical abilities much harder and
stronger so it actually does make sense
to go through a full range of motion and
even extreme positions in the gym to
prepare us to be better on the court
just like taking a french language app
for two months and getting pretty good
at it makes sense when you actually go
to friends yeah you can learn the shit
there and yeah you can get somewhat
stronger and more resilient on the court
but we can do better we can do better
and that's the whole part of sport
training so take that for what it is
next one was a more specific claim that
he kind of said that uh at least some
of the 90 degree limitations are for
athletes with injury histories
uh and that makes a ton of sense if uh
in in context and uh it also doesn't
make sense in another context so let's
peel this apart
so a few follow-up questions i didn't
have a chance to ask slash wouldn't in
that context i'll ask them now some of
them maybe more most of them are a bit
rhetorical
designed to to make a point
so the first sub question is
if you look at uh joe sieben's instagram
there's a whole lot of fun stuff going
on there
but almost all the clients don't descend
beyond certain ranges of motion a lot of
sticking to that 90 as a general rule
are we to infer that pretty much all of
us clients on instagram have injury
histories and most of their limbs or
many of their limbs especially knees and
shoulders that seems ridiculous that is
a rhetorical question because i'm sure
that's not true so the only posting the
athletes out of injuries so the idea
that that 90 degrees is something
universal and not for injuries is
probably what he's really going for i
think that's really his position i think
he made that pretty clear
but we can go a little bit more into
this just for people than in your
history because if we say okay he just
thinks 90 is good for everyone which is
a perfectly fine position to hold
doesn't make it true but it makes it an
honest position that we can examine but
then that actually leads to sort of a
logical illusion that means we say okay
that position of 95 everyone's
ridiculous of course and don't worry
we'll get to that
and we sort of already got to it in the
first prevents inflammation thing but
then we are to assume
that sort of like illusion of
exclusivity that 90 degrees in the
context of injury history is
automatically okay
90 degrees for everyone stupid and bad
agreed
90 degrees for injury history people is
a good thing because it makes sense like
you don't want to hurt what's already
hurt
oh hold on a second right
so
why is 90 degrees good for injury
right
there's no clear i don't know any clear
biomechanics to infer that an injury
management and diagnostics or anything
like that
what i do know and please if you're a
physical therapist or sports medicine
doctor do correct me in the comments the
standard of physical therapy in sports
medicine is to carefully under
controlled environments post injury
expand the range of motion up to and
including as full of a range of motion
as possible to be pain-free
so if you have an athlete that's had a
previous injury or still bothering him
the bright way to train may be a
combination of
training to the range of motion that
they are comfortable with don't
experience pain which could be 90 it
could be 120 it could be 50 it could be
like this is all i got
and at the same time working on on the
physical therapy side much less load
much more control to get that to expand
and expand and expand and then
eventually get full function back so
that 90 degrees isn't the stand-in for
safer
so first of all it's not clear that it's
going to be safer because maybe even a
smaller joint angle be safer and also we
should still be focusing on expanding
and not just lock it in well hey you got
hurt once that's it 90 degrees forever
because your shoulders are fucked um
you know you used to have shoulders now
there's actually literal tiny ball sacks
in there sorry
kind of cool you have more balls but in
the bad way so
it just doesn't make a whole lot of
sense even in the injury context
now to drive the point a little bit
further even this is why i made this
video has been really annoying to say to
someone in a debate that lasts only 20
minutes
is you know the 90 degrees thing is it's
not clear where that applies
does it apply at the knees and shoulders
only why those two joints have a very
different design does it apply at the
hips
does that mean that certain hip flexion
or extension movements that go beyond 90
are inadmissible
does it apply
to the elbows i've seen some videos of
folks there curling and doing some
forms of extension and some rowing
and they seem to go beyond 90. maybe
that's just my cursor analysis maybe
they're really stopping at 90. but
stopping a curl at 90 g whiz you know
that you know you could go a lot higher
than 90 and you're saying your boy got
these big ass arms i can't go much
beyond that shit but most people
absolutely can go beyond 90 and is that
okay the elbows is that a rule that
doesn't apply to the elbows does it only
apply to the knees and shoulders
does it apply to the hips why um it's uh
it's trippy to think about and and maybe
uh something to think through more
deeply
doesn't it apparently sort of answer
itself to me so so another thought there
for that
next
is the sort of mega claim uh or claimed
by doing actually in his case that
unstable training
uh it produces some kind of results that
we want and that's training you know
he has a variety of implements that are
shaky or he'll hang weights off a
barbell and people get shaky when they
push or pull or or squat with it and
it's uh it looks neat uh it looks
challenging uh experientially at the
time to the athlete because she's you
know trying to generate some decent
force and you have to keep your balance
much more than normal you would think
like hey
that looks like sport training must be
good well
unstable training has been incredibly
well vetted in sports science research
for now yeah bordering on like 20 years
or something like that
and the best way i can sum this up is
just simply it's close to worthless it's
close to worthless uh for two good
reasons
one it's not actually sport specific
okay unless you're as people have said
training or competing during an
earthquake
this the surface you're competing on and
the implement with which you're
competing are rather stable but
footballs don't wobble basketballs don't
wobble weightlifting bar shirt hell
doesn't wobble any more than just the
weightlifting bar you don't need to
wobble it with extra shit so it's a
violation of specificity principle on
that ground
and unfortunately
or fortunately for human body and brain
design
when your body feels itself unstable it
caps the maximum amount of force you can
produce you can experience this careful
put some pillows around but uh when it
gets nice and cold or just go to a
skating rink where you live and try to
jump as high you can as you can
vertically or just using your shoes off
of ice
you go nowhere
nowhere because when your body detects
instability it caps how much central
drive you can push to the limbs
and the nervous system is like nah right
one of the reasons this evolutionarily
was designed can be exemplified in
climbing trees or walking on a tree
limbs you know if you ever you reach
your foot out and sort of jostle a limb
if it moves around a lot your body won't
let you press down on it hard you might
want to but it's really difficult
because your body's like are you dumb
don't do that you're gonna die it's
unstable it's probably gonna break
so
your body's really good at making sure
that when it detects instability it caps
force production so now we're in the gym
for two things
well actually we're in the gym for one
producing high forces that make us
stronger and more powerful at athletic
abilities
you know football play wrestling etc
and then we're also reducing our ability
to produce those high forces
through artificial generation of excess
instability
that to me doesn't seem like the
greatest idea in the world now is
unstable training nominally and
experientially harder than stable
training not really because if you're
real stable you got to go heavier that
really blows dicks like if i'm on two
bosu balls and i have a dildo in my ass
why not as well it's an unstable one uh
it sure is going to be hard to squat
but you know compared to me getting some
really good squat shoes and really
warming up too close to my max fuck that
i'll choose the bosu balls it's weird
i'm not as good at it but it's not more
difficult even experientially it's just
a different kind of challenge and i i
want to
i don't want to put too fine a point in
this but i think the vast majority of
athletes that get sort of suckered into
that kind of training or it looks
interesting to them when they experience
it they get sort of the best of two
worlds they get to feel challenged and
feel like they're improving the sport
but also at the end of the day it's not
gutter really
hard like when you have just a fucking
barbell hanging there on the rack and
your coach is like hit this for a triple
you're like what the fuck that thing is
heavy as fuck it's bending just sitting
there you don't want any part of that
like stable training is brutal but if
you make it unstable you're like whoa
this is so tough and it's tough in kind
of a comical sense and not in the sense
that it actually makes you much stronger
not in the sense that it prepares you
for sport because that's not specific to
your sport at all it's some radical
instability it's just not a feature in
sports and so the answer is it's almost
like a
like a fallacious
way to
oh geez to kind of delude yourself into
thinking you're trying really hard and
you might be trying pretty hard but you
could try harder if the shit was more
stable
except it's less forgiving it's less
forgiving um it's almost like maybe
boxing someone and you both have
blindfolds on uh it's silly and it sure
is hell hard to hit someone but you take
the motherfucking blindfolds off
motherfuckers are getting hit way more
often hard in the face nobody wants that
so like oh blindfold weed he's over
there doing this and you're over here
doing that everyone's laughing but it's
not really good training uh
same with instability and
this is something that most folk folks
in the published uh and and professor
and high level coach sport science
industries they just don't even really
debate anymore
a topic for debate maybe in like 2006 to
2008 or something by the time i was in
my
uh phd program in 2010 this wasn't
something anyone really debated so
uh take that uh take for that what you
will
on to the next lots of claims
um
all right so joe siedman said that
uh sort of conceded that the unstable
stuff isn't actually that important
which is cool very good for him and he
said maybe he does something like 80 of
sort of sort of compound basics that are
overloaded uh hard stable lifts
uh and then maybe 20 unstable stuff and
uh
some folks in the youtube comments said
oh like that makes sense a good bit of
honesty from him
and
so here's the thing
i'm very uncomfortable calling someone
dishonest because i don't know i'm not
god i don't know the full reality of the
universe
but
you know gee whiz maybe 99 plus of stuff
on his instagram
is unstable and kind of wacky fun
looking lifts
and
it strains credulity on the 80 percent
of the actual training for athletes is
the hardcore basics
could it be the case of course he could
just be posting almost nothing of
hardcore basics to be completely honest
with you scroll down instagram a little
bit of ways
i found nothing
that was a conventional stable lift
so
uh
is it true that 80 percent of his work
is hardcore
maybe
i find that to be at face value unlikely
i think it's probably more unstable
stuff
than 20
maybe substantially more
conversely
if it's really that much unstable stuff
at least there's more honesty with what
you do on in private time versus what
you show on instagram
because if it really is 80 20 for real
compound heavy
solid uh unstable or sorry stable work
versus the unstable wacky circus stuff
then uh
gee that's a i won't call it a big lie
but it sure is a huge facade to put on
instagram be like this is what we do and
of course to his credit joel did say
that you know it's what gets the clicks
and i'll leave the um
i'll leave the business practice ethics
of that up to you i think it's like a
moral argument it's perfectly fine
uh maybe in the technical sense no one's
actually getting deceived i don't think
any business bureau would slap that with
a false advertising label but
it's interesting it's an interesting
choice i will say that
next point we got to chatting and i sort
of put up uh for this unstable and
stable discussion i put up kind of a
hypothetical
of saying you know
if i have to go against someone in
brazilian jiu jitsu which is like a
sport i compete in and i see him doing
315
kind of wacky a couple wacky reps on
this unstable thing versus i see another
competitor repping out like four or 500
pounds stable i said you know i'm
inclined to be much more scared of the
guy who can stably produce a shitload of
force because he's actually strong the
unstable thing i'm not really sure what
that shows they don't have time to
expand but the expansion would be
he might be real strong and just not
really good at keeping stable in a wacky
environment which is not jujitsu
or he might not be that strong but just
got really good at doing the unstable
stuff by practicing for weeks on end and
actually is unstable
uh max is you know maybe his real max is
365 on stable maximus 315. you can get
that close if you're really good at
unstable stuff you just have to practice
all the time doesn't make you better
anything except for doing the unstable
stuff so i'm willing to take a chance on
like
the guy benching four or five hundred
he's definitively for sure fucking
strong and for sure will maul me
or try at least
take that jk probably fuck me up
the guy who's doing 350 and unstable
maybe he'll call me and he's actually a
600 pound bench presser in real life
or maybe not maybe he's like a circus
clown word like that that's his trick
and it really only benches 365 and then
365 i'll take a shot at that title
so
his response to this kind of luke which
one would you rather fight slash compete
against the sport was he said the best
athlete is the one who's good at both
strong stable and unstable
now in order to get strong stable and
unstable
you have to train both
to a substantial extent
and so what ends up happening is the one
when you train the stable variant
you get good at it and it carries over
to sport performance when you take a
fraction of your time
to train the unstable variant it doesn't
make you much better at your sport
possibly not at all
and it is time imposing fatigue and time
demands that could have been better
spent either training for strength or
doing more sport training to get better
at whatever sport you're doing or to
take more recovery adaptive time so you
can recover more and come back and have
better sessions with the other hardcore
share
so my sort of retort to that would be
like no actually
i don't i would face the guy who's
strong who's good at both before i'd
face the guy who's just really good at
one because if i know he's doing
unstable stuff maybe he's not as well
prepared as jiu jitsu if he has time in
the day to get good at being really
strong get good at being circus strong
and good at jiu jitsu versus the guy
that's just real strong and i don't know
how good he is jutsu but his same belt
rank i don't know man like i take the
guy who does all the weird circus stuff
because maybe he wastes too much time
doing that and practices juicy less or
rests less i'll tell you this any time
i've seen any judicial athlete and tons
of them do this because they've sort of
fallen for this kind of mythology um
when i see guys posting shit and mma
jiu-jitsu or whatever and they're doing
wacky wacky lifts if i was at that
caliber of competitor i wouldn't take
them all that seriously as much as if
they were posting like legit hardcore
stuff i remember one time
pertinent because he's in the news now
jon jones got into strength training at
some point in his career and he was
benching like 300 plus like benching
benching 300 plus dead lifting like 600
or some shit like that overhead pressing
a lot
with jon jones's technique and reach
that's a scary motherfucker but there's
tons of other mma guys do all kinds of
wacky stuff and i'm like you know maybe
they're also clearly also a good athlete
maybe they're also really strong
underneath it all
but i can't really tell i can't really
tell so my emphasis here was no both
isn't good
just get really fucking strong and
powerful and then also integrate the
training into your actual sport and then
you'll become the best and we can take
that unstable surface stuff and
kind of do that with it because it's
probably not good at much
another claim very specifically in this
time
he said that uh i said you know is 90
degrees on the bench press really going
to stretch the pecs because he conceded
that stretch under load um is a huge
driver of hypertrophy which is probably
correct
and he said that if you do 90 degrees
but you properly retract your scapulae
90 degrees is actually a full stretch
for the pecs
and
that may be the case for some small
minority of people but for the majority
of people that's not even close to
maximally stretched
and if we're talking about active range
of motion which is a muscle maximally
stretched but still able to able to
produce the vast majority of its force
and thus get the stretch plus tension to
be maximum right because the more
the more stretch you have after a
certain point if you're really going for
a stretch you're like oh shit i can't
produce any tension back here so the
stretch plus tension equation is
actually lowered so you want to go where
the tension's the biggest or biggest ish
plus the stretch is the biggest and the
sum of those two is the highest that's
probably not at 90 degrees for the vast
majority of people
in the bench press and sure as hell
isn't it almost any other lift for sure
not squats not even close the kind of
stretch you get
going below 90 on a squat or a leg press
or a hack squat on your quads and the
amount of tension you feel is mine i
mean it's completely different so much
so that folks you that follow this
channel you might have used a leg press
when you were traveling or maybe
unfortunately your home gym that bottoms
out really early and you're like dude
this fucking blows i can't feel shit
when you get access to a leg press or
hack squat it actually lets you go
deeper oh my god my quads are going to
blow out of my body same with like a
bench press like chest press machines
sometimes they click here and you're
like i'm getting 90. but i got all this
other shit to go and i really can
produce more force plus tension
so i was just found that wildly
unconvincing
next
almost done i promise
at some point he said
i sort of said you know the majority of
the scientific literature is published
uh or the scientific consensus on this
you know stretch versus tension and a
few other things is xyz and his response
was something to the effect of well
everything in science has more than one
side and comically he brought up like
keto
um uh and you know a few other things
uh which apparently like there's pro and
khan and so on and so forth i can
understand that he's on mark bell's
podcast mark bell is formerly a pete
keto carnivore fan maybe currently
so i can i can see that as kind of a
diplomatic move um but
uh
it is true that science can have
differing opinions and usually does and
sometimes science has opinions that are
sort of roughly equal in how many
qualified professionals subscribed to
them
but usually especially science has been
done for a long time tends to tilt in
the direction of the likely truth so
science usually gives us clarity and not
more mystery science is different than
social media it's different than
politics where a bunch of people yappy
happy app but everyone's like well
seriously they're different opinions in
science there's actually an objective
reference point to judge what's actually
going on
accurately some people don't do it
especially people viewing science
through a political lens but science
gives us realities not for sure
realities but more and more and more
likely realities so the idea about the
process of rehabilitation expanding
range of motion the idea about unstable
surface training and a few others that
we mentioned the science on those is
pretty fucking clear in one direction
really clear in one direction
and saying that well you know
kind of equivocating and saying science
kind of says
more than one side blah blah blah that's
true but one side it's like fucking
godzilla and the other side's a fucking
gecko and he's like you know slam
uh and that's kind of that so i it's
really really um i don't want to say it
irks me it's
not fully accurate to say the science is
kind of just like uh well it's kind of
like politics you know we all have our
own ideas and everyone needs to be heard
totally true on both counts of politics
and science but some ideas are much more
likely to be correct and when you poll
scientists something like 90 some
percent of them will tell you the same
thing gee you know outside of weird
political stuff like with global warming
or some shit like that where scientists
don't even really say what they feel
because you know leftist and right-wing
crazies attack them for it uh most
science is kind of uncontroversial and
they're like well yeah this is probably
the case because for example
if you pull
uh most nutritionist or exercise
physiologists who are professors
and publishing and or professors in
teaching at the universities across the
united states and say you ask them like
you know is calorie balance an important
consideration for diets maybe 95 or 97
will be like what is this a trick
question of course it is maybe a couple
wacky people will be like wow
technically hormones blah blah but then
you have a lot of book authors that you
know publish it and they say oh whore
it's all hormones and stuff like that
you get this perception like oh there's
a debate on both sides it sure is and
there sure are two sides but one side is
like almost certainly correct according
to science and the other side's like
probably wrong and probably saying some
crazy shit so that's how i see it and so
the idea that well it's all science it's
all pluses and minuses yeah sure that's
true but in this case and specifically
in the case of this kind of training
most people who are scientifically
literate uh don't disagree on this idea
much
or at all
lastly one thing that was interesting i
didn't respond to at all i was getting a
lot of nods from the folks in the
discussion but
uh joel said that he periodically uses
the bosu ball
for foot and ankle activation to make
sure that that's good and thus enhances
sport performance and reduce injuries so
i have a few thoughts on that i didn't
get a chance to share and wouldn't share
in that context
first
the idea that foot and ankle
issues are even
common is at best tenuous the idea that
activation is the limiting factor and
creates a probability of injury or low
performance is
uh
phrased mysteriously i'm not sure what
about the foot and ankle like so the
ankle actually doesn't have any muscles
so not activating your ankle will make a
whole lot of sense make more sense talk
about the muscles that control the ankle
the muscles that control the foot maybe
that's what was implied but again not
clear
and the idea that foot and ankle
activation
is a limiting factor in sport and is
particularly something you should
address with high priority to reduce
injury
is to me unclear it's by no means clear
if that's the case so it got a few nods
like oh yeah food and ankle stuff but to
me i'm like
is that really thing i spent a long time
uh being sport scientists for you know
i'm waving my own fucking flag here but
coaching d1 athletes and stuff like that
and talking to a lot of the best
physical therapists and sport medicine
people
uh and athletic trainers and if you tell
them like so it's all about financial
activation right like that's an
important thing most of them be like
like i don't know no more than your hand
or some shit like that so it's not clear
that some kind of training specifically
bosu ball unstable training
will somehow elevate your general
abilities of activate or to protect
or to mobilize your foot and ankle will
have some kind of yield either to
athletic performance enhancement or to
enjoy risk reduction
none of that seems very clear to me
maybe some of you folks in the instagram
comments or sorry in the youtube
comments here can clarify that for me
and provide some sources of literature
even if you can't provide sources of
literature just a theoretical mechanism
would be awesome uh it's not obvious to
me i i supposedly know all sorts of
things
next
oh sorry same point here the periodic
inclusion of the bosu ball so the
periodic is what stood out to me
uh so joel said he periodically includes
the bosu all rarely doesn't think it's a
very good tool agreed on that
periodically includes it and as an
example he said you know for foot and
ankle activation potentially to enhance
that
so my
problem with that is that
periodic inclusion of almost anything is
generally a waste of time
the principle of directed adaptation in
the sub-principle of direct adaptation
in specificity in sports science says
that whatever you want to get good at
you should do repeatedly within a pretty
short constraint of time so that you
don't lose your adaptations from and go
away so back to the french language
analogy if you want to do your best
learning french you don't want to like
learn french for one week and then learn
spanish for another and learn german for
another and learn english for another
and then learn portuguese and then come
back week six or five to french again
because you'll be like what the fuck is
french anyway if you want to get really
good at learning french
you gotta do french for week one week
two week three four blah blah blah and
then at the end of that five week period
of directed adaptation to the french
language you are much better at french
so if you occasionally thrown a bosu
ball into training
it's cool it's novel it's fun you might
feel your feet and ankles doing some
stuff but it's not any stuff that's
going to hold as an adaptation because
if it holds for a little bit so your
adaptation whatever
adaptations we're supposing occur let's
say that they occur we're not saying
that but let's say they are just for
hypothetical
they improve and then you do it
periodically right so you have this
improved adaptation and then you don't
do anything about it and it kind of
recedes and then you do it again two
weeks later and just goes back up the
same thing
maybe our goal is to adapt to here so we
can actually have some utility and sport
and injury but we never get there
because it's periodic so periodic is
just not a great idea in that case and
probably in most sport training if your
sport training is typified by you doing
something specific for sport every now
and again like every two weeks or
something
you might as well not be doing it in
most cases
boom
that's all i have sorry if i missed
anything if i missed a particular claim
of his you you thought you want me to
get my take on just comment below and uh
maybe i'll get to it and i can you know
with the renaissance account uh comment
uh maybe some thoughts of mine and
please let me know your thoughts and
what you thought about the debate in
general um
you know
i i have no idea to be completely honest
if if joel seidman is a bad faith actor
or a good faith actor
if he fully believes in what he's doing
i would say i just disagree with him
that i the things he thinks are
effective i think or not
but he seemed to me like a respectful
decent human being who's very nice and
uh that's that's all really like sort of
the most important thing about being a
person anyway so i have no personal beef
with uh with dr seidman and uh maybe
he's a small guy now i have the ability
to judge people and their character that
borders on like you know below the
autistic cutoff for sure uh
i'm the worst judge of character ever so
don't take my shit as an endorsement
fuck if i know what i'm talking about
but there's no reason to suppose
nefariousness when it is not clearly
evident maybe it is clearly evident to
you so put that in the comments too but
like mikey fucking idiot he's a scam
artist liar maybe uh but maybe he's just
a guy who believes in what he does and
that's not a crime right um
unless leaves you the commission of a
crime ah i got my a lawyer and my left
hand shoulder i think every jewish
person has like a an aura of a lawyer
over here and a lawyer or an accountant
so anytime they try to make certain
decisions it's like nah don't do that oh
i wouldn't do that that's all you hear
welcome to judaism genetically not
religiously all right
bam tldr here it is
do stable
large range of motion movements that are
specific and let you practice high force
and power outputs
in the gym to become better at sports
make sure that you also train your sport
intelligently and have a really good
coach and coaching staff to help you do
that or at least watch some really good
videos and work on your own
integrate the two properly make sure
your weight training is integrated into
your sport training such that they don't
interfere as much as they supplement
each other and when one is in a high
volume phase the others are lower and so
on and so forth make sure they're
peaking and tapering at the same time
and you will see success now some of you
may be sitting at home be well dr mike
what does sports success really mean and
it's really quite simple uh money
because you get paid to play baby you're
a professional athlete now what do you
buy with money hoes
easy
coke oh yeah this is an adult channel uh
more coke
once you do coke you want to do more and
also strippers i've been dr mike see you
guys next time
