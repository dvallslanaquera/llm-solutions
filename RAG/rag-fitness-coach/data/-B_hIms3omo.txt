folks
in the first star wars i mean the one
that was released first uh episode
four
yeah
the death star blew up
but then in a later episode i'm thinking
like empire strikes back i believe or
maybe the next one you feel free to get
at me in the comments about how bad my
star wars knowledge is in any case
the death star is being rebuilt
and at some point one of these fine
folks who's you know working on the
death star uh says something to the
effect of the death star is nearly
operational
so why am i talking about that because
this is your first view
of
the renaissance periodization training
facility
and it's nearly operational which means
we're waiting in like one piece of
equipment
and really it's almost i mean you know
what i'm saying
the death star if the laser thing fires
and blows up planets that's all we need
and right now we have enough equipment
to fire the laser so
welcome
and uh i'm gonna do a workout calves
chest
triceps four total exercises this is my
regular training getting ready for a
show
fat loss phase
i'm a little tired
a little hungry
and a little low on energy but
training quality has to be training
quality
so let's get into it with some calf work
[Music]
leg press calves
wide leg press is just another way to
load your calves um
takes the
axial loading out doesn't load the spine
so it's just through the hips and
through the calves uh
notice this little thing this little guy
a little calf area for the arsenal
strength leg press
um you know how when people get uh
when they get rich enough they're like
you know nothing touches his body except
design of fibers and silk
i'm like that but i'm not rich but i got
this gym
and the designer fibers and silk is
arsenal strength baby now we do have a
few other machines from some great
companies arsenal strength i can't say
enough good things about them
they don't pay me i'm not a sponsored
athlete i just love their shit you know
can a motherfucker just say he loves
something what is it with 20 21 you feel
me
let's do cats
ah
yes
[Music]
fuck cabs hurt a lot wow
is my makeup running ten seconds break
between each of these sets four sets
today
my micro cycle number one so first week
of the meso
um
only ten seconds break because all the
lactate pretty much clears after and
good to go to another productive set
remember productive set is one in which
you're not limited by anything else
other than the muscle and you can do
more than five reps so i just did twenty
then ten then six don't tell me when a
drop off is that high we'll do another
one hopefully another six reps or so and
we'll call it
[Music]
oh
he's veiny
you're so vain
we saw chakra energy incline smith
machine press time
smith machine incline
normal grip maybe slightly wide target
is the chest upper chest of course front
delts and triceps get some work
ysmith machine just another tool that
works really well
uh barbell's free weights are super
awesome i built the majority of my size
using it but you can throw the smith
machine it's totally great um
and
let's see
what the fuck did a fly get in here two
sets today only on this exercise
later i have another chest stacks out of
another two sets
leaves me four total working sets for
this session
why so low two reasons
one it's the first micro cycle of the
meso
which means i just deloaded i'm really
sensitive to volume if i do any more i
get super sore won't heal on time for
the next workout
second is my chest
seems to be high percentage fast switch
fibers
it gets really big and strong really
fast it does not tolerate volume hardly
at all
and compound movements primarily
but generally heavier in the 5 to 15 rep
range is where my chest grows the best
and with very low volume so if i did
more volume one of two things would
happen i'd get excessively sore and then
potentially hurt which i've done a bunch
or i would just get really tired and my
chest would look flatter rather than
more pumped at the end of the workout so
don't copy the volume recommendations
all the links in the description will uh
tell you about all the recommendations
we have and you can go look them up but
this is what works for me and this is
what's right for me at the time so even
though it's kind of silly to do two
working sets that's what we're doing
[Music]
[Music]
the best part about the incline press
effect on your body
is how many like chin skin falls you can
have when you're doing this
nine
[Music]
so
[Music]
shhh
[Music]
shhh
right
[Music]
all right folks incline pressing is done
and then now it's tricep extension time
so just standardized extensions don't
worry too much about my particular
technique i have a couple interesting
things my lats and chest are too big for
me to bring my arms in closer you guys
ever see top pros do the chronological
extensions they're like doing this kind
of shit they physically can't do it any
better so use good technique we have
technique video guides and jira doing it
all very pretty i'm going to try to do
my best with technique and it's all
standard technique but i do have to make
some adjustments the fact that i'm not
not your average bear anymore muscle
size wise a little humble brag there to
start the video in any case
three sets of 20 and the last two sets
are going to be mile reps so i hit 20
very close to fail probably around there
reps on the first set rest the normal
amount of time the seconds that's also
20 reps but i may fail or come close to
failure at 15.
take three or four seconds and then do
another five same thing that's that
number three this allows me to jam at a
ton of volume lots of proximity to
failure why why not just training
conventional for me an isolation
movement like the tricep extension
has such a small amount of raw stimulus
magnitude that i have to do like eight
sets to get anything out of it or eight
failure approaches this way with my reps
do three sets and approach failure six
or seven times within there or five or
six times and then i get a really good
stimulus to fatigue ratio from that
versus just waiting around and doing a
bunch of straight sets similar to like
the leg press once you sit in there
might as well do some eye reps same with
this
[Music]
uh
[Music]
one more
[Music]
oi
[Music]
we do
the cambered bar
close grip ish medium grip bench
last exercise
just two sets because it really really
messes me up
we knew from earlier research and sort
of theoretical exploration
that
tension applied at the very deep stretch
of a muscle's
natural range of motion uh in actual
context of the joints and everything is
probably a bit more hypertrophic than
training that doesn't do that so we knew
stretch under retention provided a lot
of growth
now a couple recent studies show that
that actually is really impressive
growth and in some contexts perhaps many
you see better than full rom so like if
you bench all the way down to here and
you find some way to standardize going
up stopping here and going back down and
stopping here may actually be superior's
similar fatigue ratio wise then locking
out don't take that to the bank yet we
need many more studies to confirm but in
any case we already know it's very
likely that deep stretch is really
awesome now check this out
cambered bar
you can go so fucking deep
you'll be born to another life i'm gonna
go down as my kids are telling come back
up there's like some accountant named
phil who lives in ohio what the fuck am
i even doing that's how much growth this
should get you
let's get right into it
last exercise of the day two sets camera
burn bench gonna lower slowly take a
nice pause fully lock out let's get it
done
[Music]
[Music]
oh
so
set of 12 at 185 and yeah i've done a
lot of pushing and tricep volume up to
this
but the camera bar is humbling as fuck
the
range of motion increases crazy one
thing you notice
i didn't touch my chest any of those
reps
if you can please do arch retract and
get deep
i physically run out of room because i'm
more muscular now and my back's big
enough to where it stops me from going
down that's just a thing
go as low as you can safely
nice big stretch nice pause and come
back up
that's it let's do one more set
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
uh
set of 12 instead of nine
feeling pretty cooked it's just week one
i'm gonna keep the cooking on a similar
level
week two three four
everything gets tougher i'm in the
middle of fat loss phase right now or
actually towards the end
hopefully bodybuilding show soon
we'll see how it plays out folks
welcome to renaissance gym
i guess and uh
you know if you want to take a shot at
the title and come down here sign the
waiver and
have jared and i beat you up
let us know
see you next time
[Music]
