hey folks i'm dr mike for renaissance
periodization you are doing push-ups for
your chest
except you're having trouble feeling
your chest and really stimulating it
luckily this is the target in the muscle
series push-ups or chest are our
exercise let's go learn stuff
[Music]
first tip
is to have your butt
up
what
i thought having your butt up is bad and
the military people yell at you for that
actually if you have your butt up
significantly
it
usually leverages you more forward
giving you a higher fractional load of
your body to use for targeting your
chest
so
if i have my butt down
okay
that's a push-up fine but if i have my
butt up just a little bit
oh god that's definitely tougher and it
hits my chest that much more
[Music]
alright folks tip number two
one of the benefits of the first tip
of keeping your butt up is it prevents
any other part of your body from
touching the ground first except for
your chest want maximum chest range of
motion so we stop the push-up when our
chests gently touch the ground that
means we do something that looks like
this
chest touches and you come up
chest touches and you come up
we're not doing tummy push-ups we're
tummy touches and you come up look at
how shortened my range of motion is by
that and we're definitely not doing what
i like to call
fucking the ground
terrible don't do it
next is hand position
if you're targeting your chest generally
speaking
slightly wider is better
just outside of shoulder grip for most
people will offer the best trade-off of
the most strength and also the most
stretch and loading of the pecs if you
go super duper ultra wide the range of
motion so small that feels weird on your
uh joints and you might not even get a
good chest stretch
something just outside of shoulder width
but if it's here for you or here for you
it's all personal preference which way
your hand points also personal
preference
[Music]
what about head position there are two
possible extremes here
one is you look down at the ground
you come down and touch your chest and
the other is you look forward come down
and touch your chest
both are totally okay
what i tend to find a lot of times
is when people look down they don't want
to kiss the ground or touch their face
to the ground so they end up cutting the
range of motion
so if you're working on this exercise
for the first time or with new folks
what i'd recommend is giving the queue
of head up that means they really try to
reach with their chest and they're not
worried about cutting their depths so
they have to make out with the ground oh
that's looking pretty sexy so maybe it's
an option
next tip if you really want to target
the chest super well
slowing down the descent and pausing at
the bottom is a good idea
but pausing at the bottom means you
pause with full tension you don't rest
on the ground you gently touch your
chest to the ground while generating
almost no force if there is a baby
hamster down there you should be able to
touch your chest to the hamster making
the baby hamster feel enveloped and warm
but not crushing the hamster that would
be bad so it looks something like this a
lot of people are tempted when they do
the push-ups to do the fast push-ups
it's all set up
they go really fast that's nice but
we're trying to really target the muscle
so slowly eccentric down
gentle touch and back up
slowly center control gentle touch come
back up just like that you're gonna be
able to get fewer reps but your muscles
are more messed up which is kind of why
we do these
last tip for you guys to maximize chest
growth
is to try a deficit
deficits are awesome
not in terms of national economics
but in terms of hypertrophy stretch
under load is a big deal it will change
your chest training
for forever watch this we've made a
deficit ourselves a little ghetto
deficit never hurt anyone we have these
little platforms here
big trip from a big tip from
trevor fulbright the king of full rom is
not to put your whole hand on the
deficit is at the bottom that can kind
of feel weird for your wrists and not
ideal
grab like this and curl your fingers and
your thumb
feel really awesome and then all the
other cues apply go down super deep oh
touch and come up
super deep in stretch catch and come up
it feels incredible i highly highly
highly recommend it give it a try
let me know how it works comment like
subscribe etc see you guys next time
