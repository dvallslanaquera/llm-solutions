hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
puritization today's topic is an
interesting one
it asks the question
do high friction machines
lead to less muscle growth per any unit
of effort
i will tell you up front this is
speculative it's very speculative a lot
of our videos you can take to the bank
is probably true this one is just some
food for thought for you guys to think
about and see if your own experiences or
your own assessment of situation
logically lines up with what i'm saying
so here's the deal
what the hell is a high friction machine
well if you think about it if you're
moving around dumbbells or barbells the
friction is like the air which is to say
almost zero
if let's say you're in a real rusty
smith machine
and you push the bar up you can feel the
friction of the machine
like you have no weight on there it
feels like 80 pounds
but then when you let go of the bar it
frictions back so it's like
you actually have to pull the bar down
to get it right
extreme example
but in any case
think about a machine that has a high
degree of friction inside right
this
high degree of friction versus let's say
a very well oiled smith machine versus a
very poorly oil
smith machine one has a lot of friction
when it does not
may lead to some predictable effects
that could impact hypertrophy
first
if you have a lot of friction
the concentric phase is much harder than
it normally would be with say 225 pounds
on there say you're doing some presses
the concentric is way harder because
it's the load full load the gravity
still works the same way plus friction
so you have to push maybe the equivalent
of 250.
that means you get fewer reps of 225
than you would have you get the same
amount of reps of 250. good news
the amount of force generated on the
concentric has to be higher than you
would need to lift 225 it has to be 250
pounds which is great more hypertrophic
stimulus on the concentric
all right however
if we examine the eccentric
remember gravity points in one direction
but friction is bidirectional either way
you push it it's friction
so when you're pushing against the
friction and against gravity is 250 on
the way up
when you're taking it back down the
friction actually helps you because
you're not pulling the ship back down
you're riding it down the friction is
actually working against gravity and now
maybe it's 200 pounds on the way down
so first of all
if we get fewer reps at 225 let's say we
wanted to get
oh i don't know
10 reps but due to a super high friction
we got eight
that's
too few repetitions where you're exposed
to a high degree of eccentric load
now if you say hold on a second
the friction on the way up makes it
harder but on the way down makes it
easier so let's call it 225 with high
friction or low friction still leads to
10 reps usually in practice it doesn't
work like that usually if it's a high
friction you get fewer reps but even if
it's the same number of reps
because the eccentric component
is worth 200 pounds because the friction
takes away from the load
that means less eccentric load
with the higher friction that you have
the more friction the less eccentric
load
right
this happens essentially through
essentially what i would call rail
riding
like you can have your muscles absorb
all the load or if you're clever even
and sometimes this happens
subconsciously if you push the machine
down
forward or back a little as opposed to
just up and down
on the way down you can ride the rails
increase the friction even more because
you're pushing the machine into itself
and then the way down starts to be much
easier maybe 175 pounds on the eccentric
this is not good
because
likely
eccentric loading the eccentric phase
the slow lowering of training is a bit
more hypertrophic
probably than the concentric or the
isometric where you just hang out
so maybe
per any rep
45
of its hypertrophic stimulus comes from
concentric pushing
or whatever pulling
moving the right way moving the weight
where you want it and then the return
the eccentric may contribute to
something like 55
or like i don't know
35 45 and the rest is isometric
something like that so the the eccentric
is likely from a bunch of different
studies a little bit more hypertrophic
potentially
this is bad news because with a high
friction machine we're taking that
balance of concentric to eccentric and
ideally
i mean it's with free weights it's right
in the middle ideally it might even be
tilted to eccentric a little bit but
we're taking it we're tilting it the
other way from where is theoretically
likely optimum you get less eccentric
loading more concentric loading and that
may make
the situation much less or a little bit
less hypertrophic per any given number
of sets that you do in a high friction
environment versus low
now we also know that a unique
modulator of hypertrophy is when we're
at a deep stretch the eccentric forces
during that last third of the movement
stretch under load may cause a lot of
hypertrophy to hold on a second
uh
loaded stretch
with a much less much lower eccentric
load is particularly hard hit i mean it
would be one thing if studies showed and
they so far don't that it's the peak
contraction that really grows last third
really grows the most muscle then we can
say fuck it like whatever smith machines
are even better than free weights
because you know that last part is even
harder with friction and it loads
lighter so there's less of a chance to
get hurt on the bottom great but it's
the other way around it's this part that
grows the most muscle
and that's the part that is the easiest
and per any number of sets or reps that
you do you just don't get as much
exposure to that nasty low eccentric as
you would with a lower friction device
so far not so great
point number three is an observational
point that i have made and please in the
comments let me know if you've made the
same observation
i tend to notice that
from machines that are very very high
friction
two machines that are very low friction
all the way to free weights i tend to
get more sore
the less friction i'm exposed to and
concomitantly less sore the more
friction i'm exposed to so if i'm using
and i've used crap a lot of machines all
around the world traveling and living my
lamborghini lifestyle and usually i have
a cigar in my mouth while i do the
machine and i've noticed that if it's a
high friction machine in most cases i do
a bunch of sets and i'm like
i'm not getting a sore i'm not getting
as pumped i don't feel a ton of tension
in the muscle as much as possible where
if it's a low friction machine or free
weights i get fucked up ultra fast
maybe that's because
the low friction and the free weights
have a
much
more exposure for me for that eccentric
loading especially for that bottom third
of the move
maybe
so
final point taking all this together
what can you do
first
consider avoiding ultra high friction
machines if you have a machine that
moves really smooth and one that's kind
of creaky
maybe use the smooth one a little
counter-intuitive because the creakiness
is like well this machine is hard mm-hmm
yeah hard on the concentric but how is
it on eccentric if you had to be honest
you're like it's a little easier on the
eccentric because i can ride out the
friction like that's not what you want
second is use well-oiled machines
so like if you have a machine that's by
design not high friction but it's well
oiled and then the one you get a lot of
times there's two smith machines at a
gym one of them is moving super easy and
the other one's like 9 000 years old no
one's ever dripped any oil in it it's
like barely creaking around don't use
that one use the one that's low friction
this is a bit of a jump but maybe
consider using more free weights if you
tend to notice this in your training
because
if you prefer and if it's possible when
you use free weights you probably have
more eccentric loading essentially close
to zero friction and maybe you can
benefit more set for set rep rep muscle
growth wise
second to last
try to gauge your own stimulus to
fatigue ratio how hard the lifting is
how much your joints hurt versus how
much of a pump you get how much tension
you perceive how much soreness you get
how much of a burn all that good stuff
try to see if on the high versus low
friction stuff you can tell a difference
in your own experience because you might
be on the other end where you're like
dude shut the fuck up like actually high
fruction machines work better for me and
they pump me up more maybe more sore
maybe i'm totally wrong maybe you're
like i can't really tell reliably but
maybe you're like dude i fucking notice
the same thing so if it's true with you
that you know if you do the low friction
tricep cable machine versus the high
friction one high friction one seems
like you're working really hard but
afterwards you're like i don't know i've
tried hard but i don't think anything
happened where on the low friction one
it seems pretty tough not crazy but
after like oh my god i'm pumped out of
my mind maybe that's a good thing maybe
you can use that on your own train
lastly
please don't take this entire lecture
too seriously this is very speculative
on my part i wouldn't put any money on
it
just an idea just food for thought give
it some thought let me know what you
think in the comments and listen if if
you disagree with me say it nice i've
been going through a lot of stuff
personally and i'm just i'm just i'm on
the edge guys i want to cry every other
minute just don't be mean please and if
you're mean make it funny see you next
time
