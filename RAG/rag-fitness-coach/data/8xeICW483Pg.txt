if you get a big back if you get a wide
back with big ass lats what it does is
it exaggerates that V taper even more
and then you wear suits you wear fitted
shirts you look ridiculous like
you get a guy turn around and you see
his lats through his dress shirt
at a wedding you're like do I want to
marry that guy maybe not marry but
certainly I could go to the bathroom and
please him orally it's the least I could
do I mean what are weddings for anyway
so big back is a big deal and with or
without clothes it establishes that
 presence big back plus big
shoulders is like Super Mario like the
 grows they bonus points that is
really a look now you can't
cheat your way to that look with little
tiny arms and little bird pecks that's
not going to happen but a big back big
shoulders is a real good way to start it
again if you have small shoulders and a
big back something looks missing that's
why it's not rank one but if you have
all the other stuff a big back really
closes it out in a really awesome way
