you might be doing the wrong bicep curl
a recent study by zabal C and colleagues
compared the preacher curl to the
incline curl and when they measured
bicep size before and after the training
intervention they noticed the preacher C
seemed to lead to more bicep growth
especially at distal portions of the
muscle closer to the elbow and so
although it's only one study there's a
decent chance that pretr curl is a
better exercise for bicep growth
compared to the incline curl and more
broadly it seems that exercises that
load the stretch position well are
better than exercises that don't load
the stretch position very well for
example a cable push down is probably
better than a dumbb kick back and that's
why
