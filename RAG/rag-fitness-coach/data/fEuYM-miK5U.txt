hey folks
dr mike here for renaissance
periodization with jared feather also
for renaissance prioritization
the smith squat finally
for many many of your questions we have
a smith squat tutorial mistakes
common fixes and corrections first
where's the purpose of the smooth squat
here's the deal
it's not just squatting on a smith
machine
the purpose is specifically to target
the quads
a little bit more than they would be
relatively to other muscles than the
free squat
and we're going to do this in a way that
the free squat can't allow because of
the limitations of gravity
you can think of the muscle targeting in
the smith squat
as some hybrid between hack squats and
free squats
let's get into the details see you in a
sec
number one mistake is kind of twofold
the extreme is to think this is a
completely different exercise than a
squat it's not it's very related
so we want you to start from your
regular squat stance
and then modify from there but the other
side of the mistake
is not modifying enough and just doing a
squat with
the bar and a smith instead of not what
you want to do is target the quads a
little bit more which means
you're going to be placing your feet a
little bit further ahead than normal
but how much is determined by
essentially three very related things
one too much forward is when your lower
back starts to round
not forward enough is when your heels
are coming up off the ground
and or both not far enough and too much
forward is when you no longer feel
that the stimulus is being directed to
your quads they're not getting a great
stretch
and you don't have the ability to
generate lots of force so
jared show us some two extremes so if
yeah start a little too far back so if
he's too far back he's going to try to
do the squat and what's going to happen
is
he's going to kind of do it his heels
are going to come up and his back is
leaning over his back is rounded at this
point no bueno
he's going to try to fix it by putting
his feet like three feet forward
which is all fun and well in in
hypothesis
but then his backgrounds again at the
bottom
and he's kind of going to be feeling
that you know jared that feet sliding
forward feeling where you're like if i
push hard enough
i'm going to ice skate my way into
certain death what you want is feet
roughly three to six inches in front of
your normal stance
to stay more upright than your normal
stance your heels are all the way down
on the ground
there's no lower back rounding and
notice his quads get a
huge stretch at the bottom he really
feels it
that's what we want for foot position
next mistake is having your feet too
narrow or too wide now here's the thing
it just comes down to this are your
quads getting hit a ton
if your quads are getting hit a ton and
other muscle groups are not being
involved
too much and not limiting your smith
squat you're doing a great job
so there's really no such thing as too
wide until and unless you're like all
right
this is really an adductor exercise
you'll notice jared's built
a little bit uniquely he prefers a wider
stance squat
more often so for him this is his smith
machine squat stance
for me mine is narrower because i'm just
generally built better and feel more
my quads when i do a narrow stance but
there's no right answer between the two
however there is a possibility of going
too narrow jared do a little ballet
squat there
how do you know when it's too narrow
it's when you lose the ability to
produce tons of force
through instability like if you're not
feeling stable coming up
who the hell knows you're not even going
to recruit half your muscle fibers
because your body's like i'm not trying
to kill myself here
if you're feeling unstable or if your
joints hurt feel something weird or you
can't hit full depth and proper
positioning
it's too narrow so it's not like the
narrower you can go the better
you just want to pick a stance that
really hits your quads super well which
usually means a little bit narrower than
your normal free squat stance
and because your feet a little bit
forward and the machine supports you
that's probably gonna be totally fine
but once you start from just a bit
narrower than your free squat don't feel
like you have to move in super
super narrow there's nothing to benefit
there as long as your quads are getting
hit so
start a little bit narrower than your
regular squat experiment with just a bit
narrower than that
just a bit wider than that get a
situation where you feel your quads a
ton
you feel the rest of your body not so
much there's no joint pain everything
feels great you can produce a ton of
force that's your stance right there
three for one special on this one holy
crap this is getting crazy
just range of motion problems in general
three problems here
problem number one is your range of
motion is
too limited so jared get on there and
let's move some pig iron damn it
so yeah okay that's a cool half squat
that's also a cool half squat sounds
great
not a good idea we want the quads to get
imposed tension under massive stretch
that's the most growth
so we want to go deep which usually
means
you're going to touch your butt all the
way down to your calves pretty much
full range of motion is best nice good
stance staying upright
super deep and coming all the way back
up now
is there such a thing 0.2 as too much
range of motion
there is if your lower back starts to
round
visibly also experiences discomfort
you should try to play with your foot
position to fix it
but a lot of times if your foot position
is not the problem
you definitely don't want this to happen
and you might have to cut your depth
jared show us what an
almost full depth but keep in the back
safe thing looks like for folks that
aren't super flexible
so it might look like this and uh he
starts kind of rounding and he comes
back up
now can you show us stop there at that
point stop all the way at that part
now go all the way down so there's more
there
it's just not available to us without
compromising our technique
you should try to go lower and lower and
lower every time just by a millimeter
here and there
but if your lower back is compromised go
no lower than that so that's sort of
part two
part three super related is no
consistent range of motion
once you find your range of motion and
it's okay to get a little bit deeper
every time
but you don't want to do is have some
reps you lock out some you don't
some you go deep some you don't you want
every rep to look almost the same
set to set to set so jared can sometimes
do okay that was kind of halfway down
and then oh that was all the way down
yeah but it doesn't come up all the way
what the hell is going on
you want to do ever rep the same jared
show us what that looks like
start at the top you don't need to
powerfully lock out or anything but
generally start all the way up
you're going to squat to your preferred
depth that's safe as low as you can
with a good lower back tightness and
then you're going to repeat every rep
should look the same
one of good enough when jared and i
train we put our
training videos on instagram one of the
best compliments we've ever received is
i can't tell which one is the first rep
and which one's the eighth i thought you
were replaying a single
on loop hell yeah that's what you want
your training to look like
next mistake is another twofer lack of
eccentric control on the squat
and it almost always comes with a
destruction of technique
on the way up a destruction of technique
that's specific
to just trying to do the rep instead of
focusing on staying upright and letting
the quads get hit
a lot of times that results in kind of a
concentric good morning situation
so jared show us a lack of control on
the way down
we want control one to three second
fully central control we're never dive
bombing
so jared's gonna do one of those okay
and that's nice it's cool to do a fast
squat in olympic weightlifting
we're doing hypertrophy training so
jared show us nice control
that doesn't mean you take five hours to
go down it can mean up to
four seconds on the eccentric is totally
fine but
at least one second to make sure we're
under control milking out the
contraction now
on the way up sometimes with the
herky-jerky stuff
what people will do is they'll even do a
good eccentric contraction but they'll
let their ego get the best of them on
their way up
and they'll shoot their butt out and do
whatever it takes to come up
and sometimes with the way the smith
squad is arranged using your hips more
can actually let you lift more weight
here's the problem
we're not here to lift the most weight
that's what the regular squat is for
here we're here to target the quad so
jared can you show us when you get
tempted to do good morning
what you should be doing instead so you
want to come up you want the rep
you're tempted to just heave it what you
should do instead watch his chest
he's going to reassert his chest and
stand straight up
you're going to immediately feel your
quads more
nope and up it goes fix that technique
are you going to get more reps no you'll
get fewer reps but every single rep will
be
quality that's what we want every rep
counted on its own
every rep is great as we possibly can so
it checks the boxes of what we want out
of it
you are never on any exercise to just do
reps not when you're training
hypertrophy you're there
reps come as an emergent property
of the fact that every rep is quality if
you do a quality rep should you do
another rep
sure if the last rep wasn't quality what
the hell are we even doing
focus on quality don't get too caught up
in the numbers and make sure
that every single rep you're doing is
super good so that at the end of a set
it's all super good reps
your chance of injury is super low your
chance of getting a huge stimulus is
super high
you finally get gigantic and for the
first time in your life
you can smile in public
second to last mistake slash piece of
confusion
to pause or not to pause that is the
question
i know i'm quoting shakespeare directly
but let's talk about squatting
so here's the deal our pause is a good
idea they're
an option but if you're going to do them
do them right so you don't have to do
them you can if you want okay
how can you do pauses wrong well i
thought there was just one way to mess
it up jared just reminded me there's
actually two
one way is to do a good controlled pause
but to lose your tightness at the bottom
and have your lower back round
so it's a pause that does that good god
don't do that a pause
is not an opportunity for you to rest it
is an opportunity for you to put a huge
amount of force in the quads
and keep them generating force while
everything stays tight so do a proper
pause jared
he's just gonna pause same same but
everything stays upright and then he
comes up
super then there's the other way to
pause where as jared reminded me
you pause and then jk you do some kind
of weird double pump explosion after the
pause
because there's no way you're going to
get caught generating linear force
you've got to be an athlete and it's got
to be a stretch shortening cycle for
some damn reason
jared show us how athletes do this lol
boom yeah i took a pause but i also took
a little jump there for no damn reason
folks
this is not helping you grow muscle at
all as a matter of fact it's just a way
to interestingly marginally increase the
chance of injury
and have tracking go out the window
because who knows what you're doing at
that point
if you're going to take a pause totally
cool i love pausing on my squats
make sure it's strict make sure you stay
erect
i don't mean like that damn it and make
sure you're not doing any kind of weird
stuff after the pause
to cancel out all of its benefits
loading ranges is there such a thing as
too heavy too light in this exercise
yeah there's definitely such a thing as
too light so
sets of 20 to 30 reps on something that
is continuously pressing
pressing down on your spine not the
greatest idea
not because it's dangerous or anything
but because the systemic load
will mean your cardiovascular system or
even your nervous system is going to
give up way more than the local muscles
it's just going to give up first
so usually we like to do these in the 5
to 20 rep
big range so 5 to 10 rep range and the
20 10 to 20 rep range now
which one of those two wins out it comes
down to stimulus to fatigue ratio
there are times in your program where
you totally want to do smith squats
in the five to 10 rep range but usually
that amount of free motion that amount
of central drive
is best reserved for free squats and not
smith machine squats however
i have done smith machine squats very
productively in the 5 to ten rep range
it's totally fine
you gotta kind of watch your knee
positioning your knees might start to
hurt but other than that if it works for
you
awesome if you're getting a good pump
getting good tension do it up
the 10 to 15 rep range is
 beautiful like if you're an
italian mobster that's the only range
you train
10 to 15 is super great place to start
for these it gives you the best
combination of
relatively high forces and super high
quality with some metabolites as well
15 to 20 if you're trevor fulbright
you can do like that because you're
not mortal the rest of us
that really is pushing that boundary of
you're gasping for air and so on and so
forth in a rest pause fashion
in my rep fashion you might be able to
pull off 15 to 20 careful though to make
sure your quads are still the limiting
factor
so our best recommendation sets a 10 to
15 and then sort of
throw your tentacles out to the other
ranges to see if they work for you
folks that's all we have on smith
machine squats remember
you're not a real warrior until you do
smith machine squats
while yelling in the gym
you'll have no friends see you next time
[Music]
all right folks so
all right folks so
