lolo
long time friend
and
super jacked gal and
a nice person i hear better be nice to
jared and i our last celebrity judge
mr
juji mufu himself he's big he's hairy
he's handsome did i mention handsome
you're winning a lot of points here
thank you so much and winning is the
name of the game folks you've been
introduced hey i wonder what charlie's
up to cooking is a whole bullshit food
that no one is going to like best of
luck thank you sir all right and the
kitchen is yours thank you all right
let's let's oh
he's using the stove
you guys know there's a fire in the
kitchen there's things we already coming
out of this fire in the kitchen is this
legal so this is macro friendly chicken
and broccoli over rice um for
bodybuilders you know if you anyone that
want to
put on some
muscle or you know eat healthier uh and
we want to make it easy so we're using
frozen broccoli for this a cup of
broccoli there's nothing in that it's
every gas this is from our lovely
friends at trifecta they make you know
fruit prep a little easier this is
pre-cooked so all you really have to do
is heat it up on the stove oh is he
allowed to cut stuff look at that
technique
what you'll need is sriracha soy sauce i
like to use a little uh reduced sodium
one garlic powder and onion powder okay
so this is kind of like almost thought
out it's brown a little bit so this is
when we throw in the chicken i like to
add first
splenda
about four splinter seconds
for serving chicken over broccoli and
restaurants there is sugar in this sauce
so
this is a substitute for that it's
pretty cancerous cancer-causing i just i
can't i can't say i approve of this this
is not medically safe
some garlic powder
some onion powder
finish off a little sriracha to your
taste so you can use fresh rice and just
serve it on top or if you have
uh dailed rice you can kind of just toss
that in at the end and give it a little
stir what the fuck man you taking all
the rice how much you need
that's a good strategy
and that's it quick and easy
that took all of maybe like five ten
minutes tops
i hope you like it
what is that brown stuff
soy sauce
oh
that's what it tastes like
okay it's very good yeah it tastes good
yeah
lola what do you think
charlie charlie's cooking is definitely
magical this was
an experience and i feel blessed
to
yeah
to even be able to taste this from
such a beautiful soul
let's see
i sense a bit of
chicken
there's yes rice
and
one more thing there's one thing that's
eluding me
broccoli that's what it tastes like i
can't believe
she acknowledged my food i'm having
really warm memories of my mom mom's
cooking and
clearly i'm korean so you know i i feel
like you know he really spoke to really
spoke to me
father fucking divorce papers
what are we making do we have a toaster
the only thing he uses is a fucking
microwave clearly
god damn it we're splitting up
not really
oh really
all right
all right all right all right all right
one two three team we
are kind of gonna shock the crowd
and we're going to make
two recipes at the same time
did you do that
we are going to be making
arroz con pollo e ketchup wishes that
means and um
it does mean and in spanish and it's um
the ketchup is a little tex-mex american
twist total mexican classic and of
course to finish off the meal we are
going to be making keto bread
do it with me now
french toast
that's cinnamon toast but that's fine
cinnamon french toast holy shit what a
surprise
we spare no expense
that was artful
and he's so strong look at his forearms
oh
you may be asking yourself at this point
i'm not asking myself anything at this
point
i'm about to ask you some questions now
so it looks like we're having cat food
with lessons
charlie used a gas stove started a fire
in the kitchen literally a fire in the
kitchen which
no doubt kills so many people yearly
jared and i are you going to use a
technology by which literally
like beams is it sonic waves oh i don't
think so
x-rays closer
is it
microwave tedious little waves they're
so adorable they're so cute but they're
super advanced super technology elon
musk type shit yes amazon jeff bezos you
know what i'm saying it's a fucking
microphone
it's very impressive it's such a good
microwave
it's not a drawer folks
the microwave it does the cooking for
you did you defrost that it's pretty
cold it goes in the toaster oven first
mike i really have no idea
please don't microwave the bread too you
didn't show us how to do this yeah this
is bullshit technical difficulties
just
walk away right now chris oh fuck
remember when charlie just let these
poor people sit here thirsty and do good
news jared and i will take care of that
we'll take it while you wait for this
delicious feast we've got nothing but
the
cat cups are amazing it goes with the
meow mix that she really wants yes
yes how red
i time the spritzes by the way
hey janae we're gonna be serving you
some shut the fuck up
let me clean this plate so it looks so
not presentable no this is present okay
it's wrong it's organic okay great
why is he making more shit
why is he making more shit a ross
compoyo e ketchup requires at least
three ingredients but we even have a
fourth
oh yeah rice rice is first jared's
getting some rice in the meantime
i'll probably need some sort of mixing
utensil
which a spoon could i guess work right
sure why not
interact with food
health is our number one priority
that's fine salt bae
oh
this is what grandma used to make
all right the fuck uh
a good chef that never eats his own food
yeah i'll stand by that statement
so many times
i was gonna say cooking people but i
guess they're called chefs or something
yeah
cooking people um
often like use their filthy fucking
cookie hands to like fuck with your shit
and put it in your bowl charlie i wash
my fucking hands who knows what the fuck
charlie's hands have been on
fuck that shit looks good charlize our
toast idea and made his own chakra
french toast which is also a recipe from
the cookbook and he kind of fucking
cheated by giving them the chocolate
french toast but we'll see what they
think about it we're not out of the
running yet god it's so good
oh
beautiful
i think on presentation alone we're
fucking crushing it jared what do you
think fantastic
[Music]
you guys anymore figure this is worse up
close
this is what it takes to be a
bodybuilder
i don't want to be a bodybuilder
there was actually one bite that was
really really good
and that's when i got a bunch of hair in
my mouth
i really felt the love you put into this
thank you so much it's all about love
thank you i loved it every bit was
amazing this recipe is going on a
cookbook ah it is yes
you're charging money for that cookbook
uh we're not so sure yet
sure why not you're a genius
i know now
this comes the time for the judges
to tell us
how they feel
about our cooking
and each judge is going to give a little
bit of what they thought about charlie's
a little bit of what they thought about
ours and then render a final decision
it's it's do or die either or pass fail
well uh mike and jared definitely tried
so
i i really felt like they put a lot of
effort and energy into their dish
um charlie definitely a little bit of
stuff above he had two dishes no he had
two dishes
um he uh excused them very well and you
know at the end of the day i'm going to
support my fellow asian that's just the
way it goes
so my vote goes to charlotte oh open
racism cool open racism good job wife
what do i say like at a loss for words
the french toast was divine
chicken rice and broccoli was amazing
very very close very close
[Music]
i i have to go with charlie it was just
you know preparation time
artistic value and there was actual
flavor so ketchup is tasty
you're from michigan objectively false
review please continue charlie you're
very very talented chef like flavors on
point
mike and jared
there's so much beauty and strength in
simplicity
animals like i felt it all love
animalism everything i give it to you
guys
[Music]
we did it baby pretty happy at least one
i'm pretty happy we got one
it all lies in your hands
uh charlie
uh is chicken broccoli and rice yes
yeah
you use spinach
uh-huh but that's incorrect it's
supposed to be chicken broccoli and rice
bodybuilders eat chicken broccoli and
rice
yeah so that's where you made your first
mistake
um but you did bring some fago into this
that was taste of detroit
charlie's french toast is fucking good
wow so i'm going to give it to him i
like who stood behind the light
bush
i thank my competitors and friends
uh mike and jared um for putting up a
fight
of sorts
kind of like when uh an adult beats down
on a baby i can't get past the fact that
you have chicken and rice you just had
to put fucking ketchup in it mike and
jared clear winners to me
who doesn't love ketchup here's the
thing
losing
some people will say oh it's just a part
of life you carry on you know what i'm
saying get your your shit back together
and just keep going fuck that losing's
in the mind we didn't lose babies
on our side who actually had taste buds
thank you for recognizing actual art
because at the top level of culinary
expression it is a fucking heart and if
you're finger painting like these other
fucking dumbass judges how the fuck are
you supposed to tell the class
[Music]
in 200 years

remembered charlie charlie who tons of
