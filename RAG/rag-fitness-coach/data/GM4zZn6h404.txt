hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization nutrition
myths number two
the fat loss lifestyle
let's dig in first we're going to talk
about the claim
make sure we're exactly on the same page
of what it is that's mythical here
we're going to talk about why it's wrong
then we're going to talk about some
grains of truth because every single one
of these myths in a series does have
some grains of truth to it
and then we're going to talk about best
practices to synthesize everything and
move forward with an actual plan
versus just ragging on myths and
learning nothing from it although that
would be entertaining
so the claim of the fat loss
lifestyle is that to lose fat
and to become and be fit you need to
start a restrictive diet
and keep doing that very same super
restrictive diet
as long as you want to keep being fit
even after you're already at your goal
so if it took you
1500 calories a day to get to 130 pounds
the logic there is it's gonna just keep
being 1500 calories of all clean food no
cheats no cake and that's how you stay
there
right the idea here is that there's only
one on
mode to a fitness lifestyle it gets you
to where you want to be and keeps you
there
and the off mode just careens you off of
control
and back to your old crappy ways where
you turn into a fat piece of crap again
so you're either attaining and
maintaining at the same time
or you're backsliding this is just
not true why at least four reasons first
getting fit is much
much harder than staying fit
once you've achieved even a really
exotic level of fitness
getting lean is a trillion times harder
than staying at a certain leanness
getting strong is a trillion times
harder than staying strong getting big
is way harder than staying big it's not
the same thing and here's the thing
people tons of people the average person
sees
no difference between the two i know a
ton of you folks out there are really
lean and jacked
when you talk to strangers randomly or
rather they talk to you at airports and
bus stations and schools
you i'm sure i've heard this before
grocery stores
like man it must take a lot of work to
look like that and you never know how to
answer the question because you're like
buying burritos while they're talking
and you're like yeah yeah tons of
sacrifice all the time
the grain of truth to that is that it
took a ton of work to get to where you
are
but if you're just maintaining it like
10 body fat as a male or you know 17 is
a female
a lot of times with average genetics
after a few weeks or months of
maintenance
it's just not that hard you eat cookies
and ice cream and this and that
you have a core of healthy eating but
after that it's really just not that big
of a deal
people don't know that they legit think
that mma fighters for example who only
train hard a few times a year for months
at a time
they think these guys train 40 hours a
week every week they think that
bodybuilders are always
on their specific diet like my dad will
offer me food when i'm at home and i'm
like dad i can have whatever it's not a
big deal i know how to eat he's like
okay
is this okay for your diet and i'm like
yes good
god that's how people think binary
thinking and a lot of people who get
into fitness think like this the problem
is
if you think like this and you actually
try to pull it off with constant
restriction
it can sap your life completely of joy
or
nearly it's also going to drive you
insane slowly but surely and
because you're taking an inherently
unsustainable process
and trying to sustain it that is almost
the definition of insanity
so the analogy there that i think of is
you know taking an airplane airplanes
are designed to take you somewhere
and then you get off and you go to your
destination and you enjoy it
staying on a restrictive diet once
you've achieved your fitness goals
is kind of like when the plane lands in
hong kong you don't walk out you just
stay in the plane
a good the plane's a fine place to be
but not for a long time
you may be flying business class but at
some point that's no way to sleep
versus a real bed so if the journey is
temporary
once you get to the destination the
accommodations are supposed to be
different
you're not just supposed to do the same
stuff it took to get there to maintain
being there
really at the end of the day if you try
this it's a recipe for burnout
because you can only burn at 100 for so
long
and if you never take breaks or ease in
once you get to your goal you almost
certainly will fail
and fail people do because this
understanding
not only makes people feel a lot it
keeps them from even trying a lot of
folks
you know will say like oh so look what
kind of diet do you have to do
and you know you know they're asking you
how you got there well
protein shakes and brown rice pasta and
chicken
and they're like what about ice cream
you're like you know what i'm getting
ready for a bodybuilding show i usually
don't have ice cream and they're like no
ice cream
that's not for me and even if they don't
ask someone that what do they do they
leave through muscle magazines or go on
instagram
and all of a sudden they see all these
people eating these healthy foods and
they think okay
this restrictive diet gets you this so
if i have to cut out cookies and ice
cream which
is only something that might have to cut
out temporarily
they just assume it's forever they don't
even bother trying that i can't live
like that but you don't have to live
like that that's the big deal
now there are some grains of truth here
getting into much better shape than you
are currently
is hard and if you can't ever commit to
hard for the short term
you probably won't get into better shape
it does
probably require you to buckle down for
like a few months
two to three months can make a real big
impact for example on fat loss
all right that strict dieting you will
do during that time
will get the job done whereas just some
helpful hints and some healthier eating
might not okay so there's definitely a
time and a place for really really
strict work
but once you get to your destination you
lose the 15 pounds
your diet is not the same and neither is
the training you don't have to train as
much you don't have to diet as strictly
or as hard
maintenance is very very different from
pushing towards a goal aggressively
a goal especially that's pretty far off
of where you normally
are so best practices to take away from
this now that we know
that there's a myth of the fat loss
lifestyle it's not supposed to live like
that
it's just in temporary phases so here's
the deal number one if you
want to get in much better shape you're
going to have to buckle down
you're going to have to restrict
calories and macros you ever get
gonna have a strict diet plan you can do
it other ways but this is by far the
most efficient
and the most reliable if you actually do
this you're going to get in better shape
you have to hold yourself accountable
during this process but
this process is for a at best specified
time and specified goal
so it's not like you say to yourself i'm
going to just lose fat until
unless you're very experienced and
you're playing with exotic body
composition that's not a good idea
what you should do is save three months
i'm gonna lose five pounds a month and
i'm gonna lose 15 pounds total
that's my goal that's how long i know
this work week mentality is going to
take me and after that
i'm going to have the weekend mentality
of easing up and not being so crazy once
you know
that it is a temporary state look you
can grind
hard if you know the comes to an
end at some point right
once you achieve your goal the trick
here is to continue to be as
physically active as as possible and
sustainable and enjoyable
continue to eat mostly healthy foods
that means you're eating brown rice
chicken etc
when you're doing a fat loss diet only
eating that
now you mostly eat that and you have a
little bit of junk on the side
it's not taking the chicken and brown
rice replacing it entirely with junk
that is a recipe for gaining all of your
weight back and losing all your fitness
during this transition time you watch
your weight pretty carefully if it
spikes up a little bit eat a little bit
less a little bit less junk especially
a little cleaner and then if your weight
starts to trend down which sometimes it
will let's say after a fat loss phase
you don't want to go down any further at
your goal
you've got to eat more food or maybe
treat yourself to more more treats every
now and again
but generally speaking as your
metabolism and your energy expenditure
are going to adjust your hunger levels
are going to adjust
you're going to have more and more
freedom to eat more and more junk and
just be a little bit more relaxed as you
go week to week to week
the longer you maintain the easier this
process gets
and eventually you really probably won't
have to track your energy intake
and your macros you'll have these really
good habits that just keep you where you
are
and you won't have to 1000 think about
tracking everything all the time so what
you want to do is buckle down
get the work done be strict afterwards
in the maintenance phase
a little less strict every week as your
body weight seems to not be responding
from you adding food and having a bit
more junk
a more sustainable training plan cardio
plan so on and so forth
and eventually after usually a few
months it's like you always weighed what
you weigh
and because you have these awesome core
habits from your fat loss journey that
you've kept
some of them it allows you to continue
to live in balance with tons of treats
tons of fun
not weighing yourself on the scale all
the time or counting every macro and
still maintain those results so
if you want afterwards once you've
maintained for a while and you're now at
a new body weight new fitness level new
fat loss
if you want more results let's say you
got to 155 pounds but now you want to
get to 145
you got to reinvest you have to turn up
the heat again with another tough plan
get there do that whole maintenance
phase thing again and then you'll be
there for good eating a really well
balanced
not super restrictive diet like
regressive underload on ig
says one of our rp employees melissa
davis
great great follow by the way regressive
underload is an amazing
rp ig handle she says
fat loss dieting is temporary suffering
for long-term results so when you see
someone fit see them super lean
understand that they made temporary
sacrifices but they can look
pretty close to what they do in super
good shape in the long term
just by having those core healthy habits
and not being insane
all the time folks thanks for tuning in
see you next time for the next myth
