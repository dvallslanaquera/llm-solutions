the conventional deadlift is one of the
more common exercises performed in any
type of training program
however in recent years the trap bar
deadlift has gained popularity
in this video we'll be comparing the two
movements
and overviewing the current research
that exists
a straight bar is used in the
conventional deadlift and the load is
placed in front of your body
as you execute the movement a
hexagonally shaped bar is used with the
trap bar deadlift
you step inside of this and with the
handles either side of you
you lift the load typically a trap bar
has high handles
and if you flip it around low handles
we'll be discussing the use of both in
this video
another variance with the trap bar
deadlift is in the execution
most generally perform the movement with
a somewhat squat style
where their knees are flexed more and
their upper body is more upright
compared to a conventional deadlift
however the trap bar deadlift can also
be performed similarly
to a conventional deadlift with less
knee flexion
more hip flexion and a more horizontal
back
in this video we'll be discussing the
first type
the squattier variation as this is the
one used by most people
and the one used in all the research we
will look at
moments are forces that turn something
to understand what external moments are
let's look at a biceps curl here we have
someone holding a biceps curl at
midpoint
with their forearm parallel to the floor
the dumbbell is applying a downward
force
that is trying to extend your elbow
therefore
we say the dumbbell is exerting an
extensor moment
to calculate this extensor moment we
first calculate the force the dumbbell
is applying downwards
this is done by multiplying the weight
of the dumbbell by gravitational
strength
as the dumbbell here weighs 15 kilograms
we multiply this by 9.8 meters per
second squared
the gravitational strength to get 147
newtons
of force applied downwards we then
multiply this by something called the
moment arm
the moment arm is the perpendicular
distance from the line of force
to the center of the joint we're looking
at so the elbow in this case
let's say this is 0.3 meters so
147 newtons multiplied by 0.3 meters
equals 44.1 newton meters
therefore the extensor moment is 44.1
newton meters
to maintain this isometric contraction
your elbow flexors
so your biceps brachii brachialis and
brachioradialis
are going to have to collectively
produce a flexor moment equal to 44.1
newton meters
if you wanted to curl the dumbbell
upwards your elbow flexes would have to
produce a flexor moment greater
than 44.1 newton meters therefore
the extensor moment which in this case
was the external moment
as it is the moment primarily applied by
the dumbbell
which of course is external to the body
gives us an idea of how hard the muscles
around a joint
may work with both the trap bar deadlift
and conventional deadlift the external
moments are a hip flexion moment
knee flexion moment and a spinal flexion
moment
a 2011 paper by swinton and colleagues
compared the peak moments between a trap
bar deadlift with low handles
and a conventional deadlift subjects who
were trained power lifters
performed both lifts with loads from 10
to 80 percent of their conventional
deadlift warner
max let's take a look at the results
when subjects use eighty percent of
their conventional deadlift warning max
on both the exercises
peak spinal flexor moments were greater
for the conventional deadlift
peak hip flexion moments were also
greater for the conventional deadlift
but peak knee flexion moments were
greater for the trap bar deadlift
the greater peak knee flexion moment
with the trap bar deadlift
implies it involves the quadriceps more
than the conventional deadlift
the greater peak spinal flexion moment
for the conventional deadlift
implies that it involves the spinal
erectors more than the trap bar deadlift
similarly the greater peak hip flexion
moment for the conventional deadlift
implies that it involves the glutes and
hamstrings more than the trap bar
deadlift
however subjects use the same load on
both
exercises which was 80 percent of the
conventional deadlift for warner max
the study also tested one rep max's on
both lifts
subjects could lift 8.4 percent more
weight on the trackbar deadlift
when comparing 80 of these values this
would still be an 8.4 percent difference
given this if we compared an 80 warner
max trap bar deadlift
to an 80 warner max conventional
deadlift we would need to increase the
moment shown earlier
for the trap bar deadlift by 8.4 percent
as remember weight plays a role in
calculating moments
doing this virtually removes the
differences in peak spinal flexion
moments
and peak hip flexion moments this would
suggest that the spinal erectors
glutes and hamstrings are involved
similarly in both the trap bar deadlift
and conventional deadlift while the
quadriceps would still be involved more
in the trap bar deadlift
that said moments although being one of
the more important factors
isn't the only factor that determines
how involved a particular muscle is
there are a few other factors including
passive tension
passive tension is particularly relevant
to the hamstrings as due to the length
tension relationships of each of the
hamstring muscles passive tension is
generated when the hamstrings are
stretched
in other words achieving a stretch of
the hamstrings during an exercise
is likely more favorable for hypertrophy
and overall force production
when comparing the typical more upright
create a knee flexion trap bar deadlift
to a conventional deadlift the
conventional deadlift would achieve a
greater stretch of the hamstrings
overall meaning that the hamstrings are
likely more involved with the
conventional deadlift
the vastus muscles of the quadriceps
also produce passive tension when
stretched
so as well as the greater knee flexion
moment with the trap bar deadlift
it also achieves a greater stretch of
the quadriceps compared to a
conventional deadlift
thus enhancing the quadriceps ability to
produce force
to conclude this section the trap bar
deadlift would involve the quadriceps
more
while the conventional deadlift would
likely involve the hamstrings more
glute and spinal erector involvement are
probably similar between the two
now the data from swinton and colleagues
and all the logic that followed
was about the low handle trap bar
deadlift would all of these conclusions
here
apply to the high hand or trap bar
deadlift
let's first take a look at the
differences in range of motion
lake and colleagues demonstrated that
when using the low handles with the trap
bar
the distance the bar travels so the
overall range of motion
is now identical to the conventional
deadlift but when using the high handles
with the trap bar
lockheed colleagues demonstrated that
the distance the bar travels
is around 22 less compared to the
conventional deadlift
from this we can deduce that the high
handle trap bar deadlift
involves roughly 22 less range of motion
compared to the low handle trap bar
deadlift would this change any muscle
involvement
the less knee flexion hip flexion and
for some a slightly more vertical back
for the high handle trap bar deadlift
versus the low handle trap bar deadlift
would decrease the moment arms for each
joint
however slightly heavier loads can also
be used with a high handle trap bar
deadlift
this would probably result in similar
external moments between them
that said remember earlier we said that
the quadriceps can produce passive
tension when stretched
with the lower handles the quads would
typically be stretched
slightly more due to the greater knee
flexion whether this would be
significant enough to induce greater
core hypertrophy
when compared to the high handles
remains unknown
overall i think both would be comparable
in muscle involvement
but hopefully future research can
provide us with more details
moving on to some practical
considerations the decreased range of
motion with the high handles
could be advantageous for some some
individuals
due to their anatomy may find their
thigh bone makes contact with their hips
at the bottom position of a conventional
deadlift which of course
is uncomfortable others may also find
that the only way they can get their
hands on the barbell
at the start of a conventional deadlift
is to round their back
also due to their anatomy therefore for
these people
the high handles with the trap bar
deadlift will allow them to get in a
more comfortable and advantageous
position
another thing i thought i'd mention here
is that if you have some injury or pain
with your lower back
the trap bar deadlift low or high
handles
is likely more sensible with the
conventional deadlift
as the bar is in front of you there's
more chance of you getting pulled
forward and shifting the load to your
lower back
as you fatigue but with the trap bar
given the load is either side of you
your lower back is less likely to pick
up the slack as you fatigue
if anything the load may be shifted to
the quadriceps
a 2017 study by lake and colleagues
compared the average force
power velocity and time spent
accelerating
during a 90 percent warner max low
handle track bar deadlift
and a 90 warner max conventional
deadlift in 11 trained men
average force power velocity
and time spent accelerating were all
greater for the low handle trap bar
deadlift
although this is acute data these
results do imply that for athletes
the trap bar deadlift is probably
superior to the conventional deadlift
this would still be the case with the
high handle trap bar deadlift
lockheed and colleagues compared a one
rep max high handle trap bar deadlift
to a conventional deadlift warner max
for average force
power and velocity
[Music]
the high handle trap bar deadlift was
superior in all areas
[Music]
the trap bar deadlift does typically
involve greater knee flexion when
compared to a conventional deadlift
but compared to a squat there is still
quite a bit of difference
swinton and colleagues demonstrated that
participants on average
had around 78 degrees of knee flexion at
the start of a high handle trap bar
deadlift
parallel or slightly below parallel
squats are generally around 100
to 120 degrees of knee flexion while
deep squats can be around 140 degrees of
knee flexion
moreover although the quadriceps are
worked to a good degree in the trap bar
deadlift
the glutes and possibly hamstrings are
worked quite a bit more
returning to the data on moments by
swinton and colleagues
we can see that the hip flexion moment
is meaningfully larger
than the knee flexion moment this is
contrasting to the squat
another paper by swinton and colleagues
found that in a roughly eighty percent
of warner max back squat
with 120 degrees of knee flexion peak
hip moments
and peak knee moments are more
comparable
a different paper by s camilla and
colleagues found that during a medium
stance back squat or at max
highest knee flexion moments were also
more comparable to the highest hip
flexion moments
therefore it's clear to see that the
trap bar deadlift
is still very much a deadlift
