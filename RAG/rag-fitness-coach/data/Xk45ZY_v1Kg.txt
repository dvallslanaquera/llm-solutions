hey folks
dr michael jelly here for rp plus rpu

advanced concepts and tools lecture
number two
training modality compatibility
what is on the menu today well
first we have to define training
compatibility training modality
compatibility first
just to know where we are then we're
going to examine four factors that
determine training modality
compatibility
we're going to talk uh we actually have
a cool chart for just a quick reference
guide of
sort of what sport messes with your
muscle growth the most
and it's ranked and then we have of
course programming recommendations you
can take home with you and summary and
implications so
without further ado what is training
modality compatibility
it is a sub principle of specificity
which is the first main principle of all
training and hypertrophy training as
well
the principle the subprinciple training
modality compatibility basically says
that every single
training type interferes with every
single other training type
to some extent now
the idea of cross-training uh
synergistic training can mean some
interference is
actually positive for example
some small bit of cardiovascular
activity which really just means like
walking
around the block for 20 minutes a day
can enhance muscle growth it
actually can right but the vast vast
vast majority of anything that's not
incredibly easy
is going to interfere with any other
sport that you do any other physical
hobby that you do
right so we know that our hobby here
our sport is the attempt to grow muscle
we're asking the question of what is the
degree of interference
from doing anything else the answer is
of actually
in this presentation but the first
beginning of the answer is that
different qualities
are sorry different sports or different
activities different hobbies different
physical pursuits
based on their qualities are going to
have a different level of interference
so it's not the same thing to say hey
i'm already doing bodybuilding i want to
pick up either
ping-pong or table tennis or brazilian
jiu jitsu which one's going to interfere
with less and you're saying well the
ping pong practices are five hours a
week and so is jiu jitsu be like okay
same thing
not true not true and we'll figure out
four reasons
why that's not true specifically for
reasons of what makes every single
physical hobby or physical or sport
interfering to hypertrophy training to
whatever extent that it will be
okay we got four factors let's start
with the first
structure overlap here's the deal
if whatever method of training you're
doing outside of hypertrophy and this
actually applies to every single two
sports that combine
whatever method of training you're doing
outside of hypertrophy if it's using the
same structures
the interference to your gains will be
greater
to whatever it degree it uses the same
structures
okay that occurs in two different ways
the first
is adaptation competition for example
if you are doing uh leg training
quad training with squats and leg
presses to try to get bigger quads
and you're also using those same quads
to do long distance cycling
even if you have tons of resources to
recover from both and adapt to both
there's a competitive adaptation that
occurs between those two that it's
either
one or the other or some degree of one
versus the other for example
muscle growth training stimulates the
mtor pathway and other anabolic pathways
it stimulates the formation of more such
i'm sorry more sarcomeres right which
are the contractile elements of muscle
tissue
and it doesn't particularly enhance
mitochondrial function or myoglobin
oxygen transportability through the
muscle so it it basically makes the
muscle bigger and stronger which is
exactly how you're training it
on the other hand if you use those same
muscles for long distance cycling
training long distance cycling training
takes the same exact muscle and tells it
so all these sarcomeres we don't need
them so here's amp kinase and a bunch of
other catabolic muscle burning
processes it's going to turn those up
okay and it's going to say we need a
whole lot more mitochondria so it's
going to
literally increase the size of
mitochondria which because the muscle is
only a certain volume
more mitochondria mean less sarcomeres
just plain and simple
and it's also going to enhance myoglobin
and a bunch of other stuff it's going to
convert fibers into slower twitch fibers
from faster twitch which is in the
future going to result
in less growth for them because slower
twitch fibers actually grow less than
faster
fibers so in in many many ways
the adaptations caused by long-distance
cycling and
those caused by resistance training in
the hypertrophy ranges are divergent the
muscle
either becomes better endurance or
becomes more hypertrophy now
very untrained people let's just we're
both at the same time but when you get
reasonably trained like we're talking
about like six months of training the
little split starts to happen for
advanced people the split is literally
just completely opposite directions
right that's as it basically can look at
it like if you're a beginner it's all in
the same direction if you're
intermediate yeah you can still get
pretty good gains doing both cycling and
squatting
uh if you're advanced it's literally
like the more you cycle the less you
squat
and the you know the more endurance your
muscle becomes the smaller it becomes
and the less endurance and the more
prone to being jacked it becomes
or sorry the more the more jacked it
becomes the less enduring it becomes
so even if you have tons of energy and
even fatigue is not a concern which
we'll get to in a second
if you use the same structures for two
different things they're gonna part ways
adaptively
and it's not gonna be the greatest thing
in the world right problem
right on the other hand if you were
training upper body
and uh you didn't care about how jacked
your legs were no amount of long
distance cycling would pose that
specific kind of problem
because when you're on the you know
bicycle you're not using your biceps and
chest and stuff like that in any
meaningful way
that's going to interfere with any kind
of adaptations you can super jacked up
your body and just let your legs do
whatever
then there's no interference because the
same structures aren't being imposed
upon they're not pulled into two
different adaptive directions
however it's not the only problem the
second part of this problem
is that anytime you train the same
structure in two different ways
the fatigue imposed by whatever training
is not for hypertrophy
is going to be fatigue exactly specific
to those structures so
if you cycle a whole bunch and let's say
we somehow took a magic pill
that turned off all cycling adaptations
i don't know why in god's name you would
cycle then let's just say for calories
your cycling is just throughput of
energy if you get the energy back no big
deal
then there's no adaptations made you
took a pill and you're never going to
turn more slow twitch you're never going
to reduce a number of sarcomeres
you're just going to cycle and then next
time you come into the gym you're just
going to make your muscle bigger with
weight training
here's the deal though when you use the
same motor unit same parts of your
muscle for cycling as you do for light
presses and squats
the glycogen levels are reduced during
cycling
and you can't always eat all of those
back up micro tears form during cycling
because of the strenuous contractions
that aren't healed completely for the
next time you do squats and leg presses
so because you use and you know that
extends all the way to the tendonis
structures
so even if the muscle isn't changing on
a molecular level which it is
uh the second problem is that the muscle
is drained and fatigued by this other
sport
and then you have to try to build it
back up and build it even bigger with
hypertrophy training
so if you train your biceps or you train
your chest and you get on a cycle
you can drain the crap out of your legs
that doesn't really affect your bicep or
chest stuff
much right certainly not directly right
but if you
drew tons of squats leg presses you want
big legs you're going to have to compete
with the highly fatigued nature of
whatever it is you're doing in those
specific structures
so what's the take home here as far as
programming design
the less structural overlap you have
the better right so if you're asking
yourself
will you know uh let's say what's a good
example here
um will you know tennis
really get in the way of my quad
hypertrophy
you know a lot of tennis moves are upper
body and yeah the power starts from the
legs but it's not maximal
you don't run a whole bunch during
tennis your legs are never really pushed
to the super big limit
especially if you're good yeah you know
yeah your upper body is probably going
to get affected if you want the biggest
most hyper
upper body antennas you're going to be
really tired for your training
and you're going to have competing
adaptations and all this sort of stuff
for your upper body but your legs are
sort of
for the most part largely left alone the
best example of course is the opposite
where
cycling but if you ask yourself the
question okay i'm going to cycle
but i want to be jacked like wherever it
is for me efficient to become jack like
i don't want to fight the wind on this
one
should i train my legs or should i train
my upper body the answer is a for sure
upper body for hypertrophy training
because training your legs while cycling
all the time
is going to be fighting against the wind
in a huge huge way so if you want to ask
will a certain sport or hobby interfere
with my adaptations
you have to ask yourself which
structures of it which muscles is it
using and pushing to the limits and
really taxing
those are the ones that are going to
take the biggest hit all right so know
that in advance
factor number two is stimulus type
so we know we're let's say we have
overlapping structures okay so
we're good we're cycling and uh
squatting at the same time or we're
doing whatever sport we're using
we're going to be using for our legs the
question is
uh given that we have a stimulus here we
have a hypertrophy training and we have
some kind of stimulus here
if the stimulus is really similar to the
kind we needed hypertrophy
it can actually contribute to
hypertrophy somewhat
if we move a little bit away can
interfere very little if we move really
far away it actually pulls stimulus in a
completely different direction so
cycling long distance running
literally re-architecture your muscles
to different and
actively stop muscle growth right this
is just pulling you to completely
different direction however
what about sport like power lifting you
can say okay power lifting definitely
has
complete structural overlap with leg
training because you're squatting power
lifting you're deadlifting power lifting
that for sure uses your legs
and it pushes them hard but
power lifting trains the legs heavy
trains them hard
trains them for a full range of motion
and trains all the same muscles we need
in bodybuilding
so powerlifting training actually
contributes to muscle growth
albeit very poorly ratio to its fatigue
like low bar just beats you up a lot
you're only doing sets of two or three
or four which is not a ton of muscle
growth per set
but and you're not doing a ton of sets
because it's too fatiguing but at the
very least
the more powerlifting training you do
yeah you could have done more
bodybuilding training but
any addition of powerlifting training is
a net positive or be
just a comparatively small positive for
your muscle growth
whereas if you do 100 mile bike rides
every bit
more 100 mile bike ride you do is
negative detracting away
from your adaptations pulling your
adaptations a completely different
direction
so the stimulus type basically says that
if the stimulus
is similar to growth training or more
like growth training
if it causes some muscle growth that's
less bad
than if it causes no muscle growth
an example would be like you know tennis
like tennis isn't going to sloth your
legs off your body because it's not a
hugely catabolic stimulus
but moving around antennas is not going
to get your legs jacked
so it just spends a lot of energy but it
doesn't actively interfere
uh in a huge way and and try to adapt
your muscles in a different direction
so we've got like here's uh hypertrophy
training here's powerlifting and olympic
weightlifting or something like that
here's tennis in a neutral area this is
like less positive but still positive
tennis is like neutral and then long
distance running and cycling is all the
way on the outside
really just messing everything up so
stimulus type matters
so if someone says hey you know you got
to pick up an extra hobby
do you want to pick up high jumping
that's as randomly as a hobby
for you know your in addition to
bodybuilding or do you want to pick up
you know long distance road racing
well you have to ask the question of
what stimulus type is high jumping is
predominantly recruiting faster-rich
motor units
usually in such a way that doesn't
hypertrophy them much but also doesn't
add a ton of fatigue and you can for
sure slab
super great hypertrophy workouts after
you do your jumps it's not going to help
your jumps much but the jumps themselves
don't interfere with muscle growth very
much
however if someone's like yeah but
you're still going to use your legs same
thing right you should go run marathons
no way because the stimulus type is so
different running marathons that it's
for sure
costing you muscle by just adaptive
redirection rather than at best neutral
and it
was sort of or second best neutral and
it you know first
best versus you know first runner-up is
just not nearly as
as hypertrophic as a muscle growth
training but
still can grow some muscle right with a
high jumping example there right
so uh there we can actually
sort of categorize this in a more
objective way if the training that
you're doing for the muscle groups that
you're also doing hypertrophy training
for
if this other sport or other hobby is
higher in force that's usually a good
thing in this regard we'll see how in
other ways it can be bad
higher force is better because it
probably leads to some muscle growth or
some muscle retention
more range of motion is good right so if
you have a high force and a high range
of motion that's probably already
causing some hypertrophy
and closer to failure is good right so
if you have power lifting
like you're doing your power from
training sets of eight in the squat with
a high super high force lots of rom
closer to failure gee that's actually
just pretty good bodybuilding training
it
might not be ideal because it's low bar
versus high bar but geez we're really
like nitpicky here
on the other hand if something is low
force running you never generate a whole
lot of force running long distance
lower rom you bend your knees this much
when you run it's not a ton
and very far from failure well you
should better hope that marathon
training is really far from failure
otherwise you're not going very far
those just cause a very different kinds
of adaptations
endurance style adaptations and they
basically supply
almost no muscle growth adaptation short
of the complete novices
and they uh are really really different
stimulus type and thus they're the worst
possible they have
most negative interference effect the
largest interference effect on your
growth training
factor number three this one's super
obvious we're just gonna breeze through
it energy demand
okay in hypertrophy energy can be used
fundamentally for two things to fuel
muscle growth training
and to get you to train hard and or to
fuel muscle growth recovery
and adaptive processes so you any amount
of training you have if you want to be
the best bodybuilder you can be
the most hypertrophy person you can be
you should only be using training for
two things
training as hard as fucking possible or
using that energy that you eat for
resting and recovering and relaxing
so you can train as hard as possible
right train super hard grow super hard
train super hard grow super hard and so
on and so on and so on
if you take a hobby and you smoosh it in
there
it's going to take some of that total
energy you've got for either
training or growing and this hobby is
going to insert itself in there be like
nah fam
boom i'm gonna take some of that and
then you have less training for either
recovery
slash adaptation or for uh oh sorry less
energy for either recovery adaptation
or uh for more training right so how big
your energy demand
is of that hobby is a huge factor in how
much interference effect
right the more energy that the competing
activity uses the less energy left over
growth and recovery
and that itself will lead to more growth
once you recover um
so the degree of energy demand allows us
to quantify
how much of a competing stimulus we're
presenting right
so so here's the uh the ultimate a super
simple example if someone asks like hey
and this is something like
i myself get asked on instagram like all
the time right hey like
does running interfere with my gains
right uh
the next question uh somebody educated
in sports science will ask you is how
much
how much running because if someone runs
two to three kilometers like you know
mile mile and a half
um every several days gee you know you
can have damn near the biggest legs in
the world and do that
okay but if your idea of running is to
run 10 to 15 kilometers
every day or twice a day as part of an
integrated marathon running training
program
holy crap just on calorie burn alone
how god's name are you supposed to
recover from leg workouts when you're
running that much
and how in god's name are you supposed
to have really good leg workouts
at all right so half the time you know
you're too tired to have good leg
workouts
and even if you have a good leg workout
your your running is sapping
so much energy from you know your
caloric intake that you're taking that
really small sliver of it ends up going
to hypertrophy processes right
so this is a super big take-home point
and we'll reiterate this later
if you want to do a certain hobby and
you're dead set on doing it
but you want to cause the minimum amount
of muscle growth problems for yourself
just for the love of god try to do as
little of that hobby as you can as you
can sort of
live with because the more of any hobby
you do the more of any physical activity
you do
the more competition there will be with
growth plain and simple super super easy
to understand
factor number four also really
straightforward
is disruptive degree if your training is
highly disruptive and highly damaging it
generates more fatigue per calorie spent
and thus it interferes more with
hypertrophy training on two fronts one
healing the microstructural damage
requires resources that are taken away
from uh
adapting you to hypertrophy training
that's probably not the biggest problem
though the biggest problem is that
if you are sufficiently damaged your
ability to present an overloading
stimulus and pertrivet training is
tougher
like you know if you play a whole lot if
you do a lot of parkour
and your knees are physically hurt from
all the crazy landings how the hell are
you supposed to do high volume squats
you might have to do low volume squats
you might have to lower the weight you
might have to stay further from failure
you might have to avoid some of the most
uh quad demanding exercises because your
knees hurt and all of a sudden you're
not getting the best
thing you can out of training right
thing is
yes how much of an activity you do super
super matters and everything becomes
disruptive at a certain level
but things are very differently
disruptive at an average level
so we can choose our activities and be
intelligent about them based on how much
uh disruption and activity occurs per
unit time or even better phrased
per calorie right so
for example brazilian jiu jitsu or mma
wrestling or gymnastics
will mess you up top to bottom why
because they impose super high joint
forces high force eccentric movements
landing in gymnastics for example if you
don't land on your face
right and contact damage like people in
jiu jitsu will land on you and you'll
get hit with punches in mma like
that stuff requires healing to occur and
if you have a big ass bruise on your
quad for muay thai leg kicks
you're not having the best squat workout
you're just not right and forget about
what the bruise is actually doing to
your muscles
certainly sapping their ability to get
bigger until it heals right
what about hiking you hopefully don't
come back from hiking with bruises all
over if you do you're running into too
many bears you need bear mace
different story hiking will do almost
none of that
you'll come back off of a five mile hike
and feel better than when you left
but you sure as hell won't feel better
than when you left emotionally you might
from doing brazilian gymnastics
but you sure as hell won't feel better
physically i come home from brazilian
jiu jitsu i stand in the shower like
this and i stare at the wall
as i can't feel most of my joints
anymore when i start to feel them again
they start hurting
right definitely super different so if
you hike for
five kilometers a day on average you
might burn 500 calories a day
uh and interfere with growth very little
so that's 3 500 calories of fat burning
that's really awesome super super small
growth interference
however if you do 500 kilocalories of
gymnastics
holy crap folks for a lot of people
that's like an hour of gymnastics
and brazilian jiu-jitsu that's legit
like half an hour of brazilian jiu-jitsu
of live rolling it's like 500 calories
for the average size person
your muscle growth training is going to
take a huge hit from that
so disruptive degree matters and you
know intuitively how much disruption
you're
feeling so don't lie to yourself right
and people ask all the time and i have a
video on it on youtube dedicated that
bjj and lifting weights
with my last name type it in you'll see
cool video the biggest thing if you want
to do combat sports for example
with uh hypertrophy is understanding
that your sport
messes you up you need to do as little
as possible that you can get away with
or that you're comfortable with making
the trade off
there's no way way you're going to do 16
hours of brazilian jiu jitsu or muay
thai
every week and still get as jacked as
you possibly can because it just beats
you up too much but if you do 16 hours
of hiking a week you can very well be
super jacked
right here's the deal we take all that
sort of
stuff together we rank a bunch of sports
on how much they have all those
right and we come up with like a very
rough guide and it's not going to be the
same to all people but it's a very very
good start
of rankings of what is most uh
interfering with hypertrophy training
what's least interfering
endurance sports rank number one
triathlon distance swimming distance
running distance cycling
those interfere to a huge extent with
hypertrophy based on all the things we
mentioned
structural overlap especially for the
legs is really high although for
swimming it's total structural overlap
stimulus type is completely different
energy demand is massive
disruptive degree is really high at the
energy demands that we expect right
you don't you know running is not very
disruptive until you run 20 miles a day
and then it's super super disruptive
right
next are combat sports combat sports um
have a ton of structural overlap because
they use basically your entire body
the stimulus type is sometimes pretty
similar because there's some high forces
so that it gets a little bit of a pass
on that
which is why it's not ranked the worst
um energy demand is super high with
combat sports and the disruptive degree
is
absolutely massive which is why it's
ranked so highly so far away
ideal compatibility with hypertrophy
training team sports and glycolytic
sports so things like soccer basketball
volleyball etc
just a lot of work a lot of wear and
tear glycolytic sports push you to the
limit
and really interfere with free energy
demand mobility sports are now a little
bit better
yeah gymnastics properly done you can
still be very jacked
gymnastics scores uh you know
poorly on structural overlap because it
uses most of your body but on stimulus
type it scores really well that's
actually very similar to hypertrophy
training
energy demand it's course not uh super
poorly because it's just
gymnastics you do stuff and the arrests
do stuff for us the total energy demand
isn't that crazy
especially if you're doing it as an
adjunct form of just fun training
the disruptive degree is pretty big but
there's ways to minimize that so it's
not like uh the worst thing in the world
parkour very similar to gymnastics um
strength sports
are you know their disruptive degree is
very high but
their uh structural overlap is actually
a benefit because the stimulus type is
so similar
so strong man power lifting etc is
really good power sports like
weightlifting and high jump etc have all
of the stimulus type concordance uh and
but they have a very very low energy
demand and often a very small amount of
disruptive degree
you could do a weightlifting workout you
can do hypertrophy where you just fine
you do a powerlifting workout
you might go home you do a strong man
workout you might go to hospital
right so there's different uh levels of
interference there
just through the disruptive degree and
then low expenditure
uh uh technique sports like table tennis
golf for example
uh you know they're very very easy on
the body for the most part they do run
into some wear and tear injury kind of
things
but they usually don't cost a ton of
calories table tennis can cost a lot of
calories if you play it super
competitively if you play recreational
it's usually just a really good form of
cardio
um and then of course it doesn't have as
much you know overlap especially with
leg training and core training
golf has very little overlap uh with
muscles that it pushes to to the limit
because it's really not pushing anything
to the limit
and then of course low impact hobbies
rank as best hiking frisbee
not competitive ultimate frisbee just
frisbee throwing around with friends
yoga stuff like that
those basically if you go through
something like yoga structural overlap
is very high
the stimulus type is either similar to
hypertrophy training if it's like you
know yoga poses are difficult to hold
for a couple seconds
or if the stimulus type is really just
so uh it's a good for flexibility or
something that just doesn't interfere
with hypertrophy almost at all
energy demand is super low and the
disruptive degree is
to some combination very minimal and
actually may make you more resilient to
your own training so if you do yoga for
quite a while you develop a high degree
of flexibility and mobility that might
actually
keep you safer and less disruptable from
your own bodybuilding training so it
might actually be for a little bit of
yoga maybe in that benefit
right so take a look at this chart if
you're really confused and just
understand
what you're doing with it right don't
pretend like things are costless so
programming recommendations taking that
chart into account when you consider
what physical hobbies you want to do and
wondering how they'll interfere with
your muscle growth
consider the following how much do they
tax the same structures if they tax the
same structures you're trying to grow a
lot you've got a little bit of a problem
on your hands
number two how similar the stimulus is
if it's a really different stimulus you
got more of a problem if it's a similar
stimulus that's sort of for the best
number three how high the energy demand
is ready if it's a really high energy
demand
then it's really bad and this really is
a question of how much of them do you do
right if you say hey i'm on a train for
a 5k okay
your score is the same as marathon
training and everything else except for
energy demand
uh and that should be fine right uh but
if you train for a marathon then you
will not be fine because the energy
demand is so massive even though all the
other scores are the same
and of course the degree of disruption
which scales with energy demand for sure
but independently you know if you play a
lot of table tennis you're probably not
going to have
you know a crazy amount of disruptive
injuries to your body preventing you
from being hypertrophy but if you're
getting onboard in brazilian jiu jitsu
three days a week you might not be as
good at hypertrophy training
as you could have been here's the thing
you want to know how much interference
you're causing
and be honest with yourself and then
wiggle the application of hobbies
to reduce that if you want for example
if combat sport is important to you
let's say brazilian jiu jitsu let's even
say muay thai
but also so as bodybuilding so
hypertrophy training what you can do is
if you don't have a fight coming up
you can do a lot of uh light bag work
um and a lot of shadow boxing and a lot
of technique work and do
very light sort of touch and go sparring
as
uh you prepare for a fight maybe last
six or eight weeks
then what you can do and so if you do
that you do very easy training it's not
very interfering and you might not do a
ton of muay thai
as a fight gets closer you do more muay
thai you do more contact stuff
you do more hard punches you take more
hard punches and kicks and all of a
sudden
your interference level goes up but
maybe you reduce your hypertrophy
training and just maintain for that time
you have your muay thai fight and you go
back the other way around so there's
times where you can push and pull a
little bit with these things
to get a purposely less or purposely
more interference
right summary implications to finish
this up folks there is
no free lunch in this sort of manner you
can say well i want to do this and this
i'm going to combine them and be great
at both
sometimes in really rare instances a
little bit of yoga
a little bit of relaxed walking cardio
and hiking
can be a net benefit but that's very
very rare
mostly it's a net cost it's just to some
degree right
all physical training interferes to some
extent almost always for the negative
that does not mean you have to quit all
of your physical hobbies because there's
more to life than lifting weights and
being jacked
just kidding that was a test joke to see
if you really thought for that but
seriously
there's more to life and if there's more
life for you than getting jacked and
that's super awesome
just means you know what you're getting
yourself into and not be surprised when
muscle growth isn't what you expected
um and of course you want to be able to
change the way you do hobbies sometimes
to minimize their effect
or to maximize the effect of the hobby
or vice versa
basically this entire lecture could be
summed up in this if you
are doing hypertrophy training you
really like it and someone says hey do
you want to start doing
xyz activity with me you may want to do
activity with that friend
and you may have some tolerance level of
how little how much hypertrophy
potentially you want to give up in the
short term
if you know this information you're
