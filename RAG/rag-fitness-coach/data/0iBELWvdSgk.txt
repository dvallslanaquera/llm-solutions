folks we're back again we should wrap up
all these rp plus questions today i'm
hoping we get through it dr mike how's
it going
doing well we're ready to wrap up rp
plus and open the floodgates to youtube
next time oh my goodness all right well
folks we're just gonna get right to it
start handling business here
i got a bunch of bullshit open that i
probably should close there we go
okay here let's get started rafael
serge says
uh rp james dr dr james uh dr mike it's
rp james
no joke today kappa bars is nothing to
joke for that's a killing machine
they are killing machines dude every
time if you go on
folks if you are bored go on instagram
and just look at capybara pictures
because they are friends with all
members of the animal kingdom you'll see
them hanging out with like crocodiles
or people i don't know if they're
crocodiles alligators whatever but
they're all over the place they're
hilarious
okay he continues is a mixture of guinea
pig with dog personally
personality dog personality uh
near i live is full of them it's
incredibly flaming
but you have to kill them from afar
because if it gets too close you can't
do it
because they're so cute and friendly or
you could if you are a psycho
never killed anything and if i had to do
it myself probably go vegetarian but i
do not so i eat a lot of meat
this animal is really chill too much
sometimes but they
have really don't give a fuck
personality and are very affectionate
as a giant rodent their meat is like
alligator
if one of you have eaten those yup
actually yeah uh there's a blend of
chicken deer and lemon in the taste
and really tender like ostrich which i
really encourage you to try both
if you never did is awesome brazil meat
scene is amazing
yeah so i've heard all right
i'm done with the diet i posted a
picture of making advertising as a
thanks for the knowledge you allow me
to steal from your brains paradox and
now finally we'll go to my questions
all right in concerns of libido i'm done
with a diet
lost 12 kilogram and mostly uh
in total mostly fat i'm start eating
more but my libido is still
wackish this is probably normal because
i'm not that worried about it but i
would like some perspectives
with the only calorie content will be
enough to become normal or do i need to
increase the fats
i mean 0.6 body weight in fats and weigh
67 kilograms for now
um i think that your libido should
renorm as long as you're not ultra super
crazy psycholean
um i think you should be totally good so
i think that yeah
[Music]
excuse me yeah all right and
let's see moving on other question is is
it possible that i will never normalize
body fat
uh because the um possible never
normalized because the body fat is lower
in the 12
zone not that i think it will be just
for curiosity's sake i wanted the future
to keep eight or ten percent if i can
handle it without too much effort like
with eating plenty of fat
calories supposedly would be normal for
most people right of course in a
reasonable range like the above
if you can maintain a lean physique
without absolutely amount of exercise
what's the fatigue ultimately
will be unable to express the sex drive
either way opinion i think that if you
stay
in that 10 range or above uh i don't
think you have
much to fear with sex drive being
perennially suppressed especially if you
take a nice little diet break
and maybe gain a percent or two and then
slowly lose it with an upcoming diet
then i don't think uh sex drive should
be a problem that you're to have um i
would be very surprised
if your sex drive was chronically lower
at 10 percentage body fat than it was at
15 or
20 and that in fact many people report
quite the opposite once they've
renormalized
where sex dive starts to become a
problem this long periods of dieting in
any body fat
could extremely reduce calories for any
amount of time and
if you're like below ten eight below
eight to ten percent
then anything down there you might not
have a ton of sex drive with james
anything uh to add to that
i think the um there are a lot of
numbers that you can kind of go off of
which is what we're talking about here
but ultimately this might be an
individualization thing where
you might be able to hang out at that
lower body weight without a ton of fuss
but you also might feel shitty at the
same time so
it's kind of hard to say i think from a
numbers standpoint if you get a good
maintenance phase and you're able to
bring your calories back up and
and you can stay that lean and you feel
good i think it's totally doable but at
the same time
there are plenty of people where just
being that lean is not
sustainable for a variety of reasons and
that's perfectly okay too
so just keep that in mind it's not if
you are if you if you find that your sex
drive is not rebounding
even though you are seemingly doing
everything right maybe it's just not
meant to be uh in terms of holding on to
that level of body composition
and your sex drive goals so that's when
when body cop wins out or when sex drive
wins out they're gonna have to shift a
little bit one way or another
yeah yeah there's definitely a lot of
individualization there
uh all right next question in other
regard is it possible to reach
like a mrv in the upper chest but not
the other fibers
i got onto tracking wrap sets and weight
and that makes a lot of differences
is so much easier to estimate things and
intellectually
think about stuff if you have proper
data but from the data arise this
question
like if i'm doing an incline press smith
machine and now at 15 cents per week of
upper chest
and flat bench 12 sets last week i added
uh
weight to upper and was all good but
with the same leak i did four reps less
flat bench was up for the same load my
program is focused on triceps so the day
before of the weight and reps and sets
it was okay blow blow me reps out of the
water
with some number of sets doing them last
week of course
current exercises are machine dips
uh 15 sets and cable overhead tricep
extensions 12 sets
weight and reps going up and both but
they preclude the chest training
which is the next day but so far so good
last week i have a minor uh pinch in the
front delt
is this mrv but only for upper pecs i
have this week and one week on the
dealers coming so
james and i don't like to conclude mrv
based on one shot at it
we like multiple shots so you get to a
certain volume
and you start to have performance
decrements maybe that's mrv maybe it's
just
50 other complex factors just luck of
the draw or some kind of thing where
your program is designed sort of poorly
and your
front delts are too tired it makes it
look like your upper chest is just tired
so i'd say change the program a little
bit
and then expose your uh your lower
fibers and upper fibers again to an
incrementally
higher higher level of volume and then
at some point you're gonna reach another
uh plateau
of strength and a decline and and once
you reach the plateau of strength
then you might be in a position to say
oh wow it happened
pretty much at the same number of sets
or something very similar you know now
we're more confident that's probably mrv
and if it's a very very big difference
between that for your
lower packs and your upper packs that's
totally a possibility so it's absolutely
possible i just wouldn't be confident
one run at it is going to conclude that
james yeah so i totally agree with dr
mike here but just to play around with
the question is it like possible that
you can um
you know overreach some parts of the
fibers within a muscle and not others
like
yes it's it's it's feasible that you
could do that is it practically
significant i would say
no at that point because what are you
going to do what's the alt like can you
there's so much overlap from most of the
chest movements that you do
that it's very impractical to think that
you could actually continue doing chest
training while only part of your chest
is overreached and part of it is not
at that point that's like one of those
like um where i think mike and i would
both laugh if we saw a paper that
published that was published and said
like look
you could overreach some of the muscle
but not all of the muscle huge practical
implications for hypertrophy we'd be
like
this is like a laboratory phenomenon not
like a gym
real world phenomenon so it's like it's
one it's a good thought experiment
but the outcome is ultimately the same
which dr mike already talked about
we're not even clear if that is the
outcome but if it was
what are you going to do about it you
know if you're going to have to de-load
because you can't turn chest at that
point
anymore yeah i mean you could like from
the front end of a program at the
beginning
program a little bit more horizontal
pushing stuff and a little bit less
vertical pushing stuff if you know your
vertical gets tired faster
but other than that man it's just uh
it's kind of how the cookie crumbles and
there's a lot of cross
contamination between those two so yeah
um
all right i have a problem i would like
to leg press and mike
uh and i saw the video from leg pressing
but i have a problem in the achilles
tendon they are not flexible at all i
have to use very big leverage
to squat and leg press i cannot keep my
heels on the pad
i would like some pointers under fixed
needs or some method to do other
exercises and be effective is there a
problem to let the heels pull out and
exert force yeah i wouldn't do that i
wouldn't let your heels come up
that's a recipe for instability lower
force production potential injury
the only two actually i can do is squat
motion is lunges that i enjoy because i
don't need anything and squats which i
need a very large thing
uh block basically to set my heels uh
onto he
by the way he says heels he spells it
r-e-e-l-s
i was like brazilian
in in in portuguese pronounced heels
actually so okay
um me to go with a greater range of
motion i'm very limited
and would like some pointers even so
with this limitation my legs grow well i
think it happens with like genetics but
i would like some more exercise for your
ability
media start to get beat up for this type
of limitations i would say i would try
bulgarian uh
rear front elevator split squats that
would be a good idea i would try well
messing around with your foot position
so a wider stance can often get you a
bigger depth
still hit your quads while still letting
you keep your heels on the pad changing
the leg press angle
putting some kind of pad underneath your
butt to get the higher angle is probably
a good idea trying hack squats with a
very small position is a good idea
i would try all of those and if you want
to re-watch that youtube leg press
technique guide video that i made i go
through some of those recommendations
there
yeah those are all solid recommendations
and you can always try changing up some
other things like you can
do like exaggerated mind muscle
connection protocols where you're adding
like slow eccentrics
pauses like peak contractions things
like that
on top of the techniques that you
already feel really comfortable with if
you don't want to like
try a bunch of new stuff that you're not
totally sure how it's going to go so i
think any of those would be great
[Music]
um then he says thanks guys keep up the
good work thanks for the help as always
and for allowing the promotion vulture
to stay making idiotic questions and
fucking around for one more month
[Laughter]
that was a good good series all right
nicholas h hey guys can you explain how
to adjust your lifting volume to balance
it with increases in endurance volume
i'm training for a military program
has some substantial endurance
requirements but strength remains
important for injury prevention moving
around heavy stuff
my endurance plan is six months long it
begins with a weekly volume of four
hours in total running swimming and
rocking
peak endurance volume is 9.5 hours 10 to
20 percent
of weekly volume is at a moderate high
intensity and the rest is low intensity
lifting-wise i'm planning a two-month
phase if i purchase for weight loss 2-3
months of strength 1-2 months of
maintenance
thanks for being excellent uh james yeah
so when you're doing a lot of endurance
training you kind of get you kind of get
a one-two punch
on the uh resistance training side of
things the first one is depending on
what modality that you're using
that like for example running your legs
already take an immediate hit in terms
of how much
training you can do so that's a local
factor right really the big issue though
when you're doing a lot of cardio
is the systemic factor so you basically
take your mrv if you were just doing
only weight training you start adding
cardio and your systemic mrv starts
doing this the more cardio
you start adding right in terms of how
much weight training you can tolerate
because you're adding in training from
another source so if you were to look at
it as like total
mrv would stay the same but if you're
looking at like how much weight training
can i do it's coming down as you know
cardio is going up so it's kind of a
one-two punch in terms of local and
systemic so
ultimately there's a couple different
options if um if you're going to do a
cut
i wouldn't push the cardio as hard as
you can that way you can at least train
hypertrophy enough to maintain your
muscle mass as you lose weight
and then kind of as you start
transitioning into your strength e
type stuff you might consider just
training your uh resistance training
stuff down to maintenance volumes if you
find that the cardio stuff is really
really wiping you out
and or that you're not able to express
some of the strength that you normally
would uh you know numbers that you would
normally hit so it's
i wish there was like a solid answer
like reduce your sets by x number but
there's really not it's a lot of
guessing check and you just kind of see
where you're going
so depending on how much cardio you're
doing you might be able to keep in like
an mev level of strength work which
would be awesome
but if you're doing a lot of cardio like
running swimming and rocking at that
point
my recommendation would be to think
about just going down to mv on your
strength stuff because the swimming
wrecking
and running is is substantial i mean
that's a lot especially the rocking is
gonna wear you out systemically
and it's a great form of cardio but uh
there's not much you can do there's not
much you can do except for guess and
check so at that point i would go
go to mv do your best and go from there
good answer all right matt malloy says
hi doc's couple quick questions
uh i am a former d1 sprinter has gotten
into bodybuilding
because i'm an outlier in terms of
muscle fiber composition for many muscle
groups i was wondering what advice you
have for people like me who are
predominantly fast forward
when it comes to training any general
observations of fast switch athletes
you've made over the years it can be
beneficial
should be doing anything differently
when it comes to frequency rep ranges
exercise selection proximity to failure
rest times position etc yes oh my god
i'm glad you asked this question so
here's the deal
anything when it comes to frequency yes
lower frequency will benefit you because
your muscles will probably take more
time to recover than the average person
uh rep ranges you should probably bias
your reps more than the 5 to 10
and 10 to 15 range and less into the
other ranges but
their your own individual stimulus to
fatigue ratio exploration should confirm
that and if it doesn't you should buy
them wherever your sfr leads
um exercise selection something that
allows you to generate high forces uh
compound heavy basics usually work
really really well for faster twitch
individuals and a lot of times isolation
movements just kind of lost on them
because they can't even
get their mojo going and produce a ton
of force so like for you yeah you might
grow bigger shoulders
with lateral raises but uh some upright
rows or something like that something
more dynamic might actually
grow your shoulders a bit more um the
proximity to failure probably doesn't
change although
uh you're you have to really really
respect
the rir more than people who are slower
twitch lord rich people
they they require a lot of neural drive
to activate everything
if they don't do much damage training
and they recover really quick so they
can do like one rir and zero hour
training weeks weeks a week to be fine
you won't be able to do that so really
start through your arm and slowly
progress
rest times you need more rest and if you
rest longer you're going to
have much better performance and much
better recruitment much better growth
for someone really really fast which i
wouldn't fuck around with 30 second rest
kind of bullshit because it doesn't work
and for periodization the standard
periodization applies you just sort of
start all these values a little bit
lower
and you may increase frequency over the
block and you may increase
uh the uh higher interrupt range
utilization but not by as much as some
other people would
so you basically your bodybuilding is
going to look a lot more like
powerlifting than the average
bodybuilders
yeah on that point on frequency that's
i'm glad you brought that up because you
might not
be paralleling a lot of the stuff you
might see on the rp hypertrophy hub
where it's like oh okay i'm training
quads four times a week
two times a week right so you'll be
lucky to go up
you know like a half a day in frequency
on something uh
if you have really fast twitch quads for
example i have another one um
your per session volume should start out
very very low because you're going to be
really really responsive to it
and your journey from mev to mrv in each
cycle
would probably be more benefited by
being load progression than a set
progression
so you should definitely add sets if
you're just not getting sore not getting
a pump or whatever
but if things are pretty good from the
soreness and perspective
just add load slowly don't add a ton of
sets
because you will get most of your growth
with lower volumes than most of the
people
uh uh compared to you will with slower
fiber types whereas people who are
really slower twitch
good god you need to smash them with
volume and add an atom
and add an ad because they just adapt to
volume super quickly and they can
benefit from more usually
your u-shaped curve for volume exposure
is probably going to be on the lower end
of things
if you're talking about sets per session
of course you go by recovery and
performance and soreness and pump
but i would expect you to get your best
results in between
three to six working sets per session
per muscle group
not in the six to twelve working sets
per muscle group rage
real fast which guys you give them two
three heavy sets of squats
and you know three sets of squats in the
five to ten range
and then three sets of leg presses in
the 10 to 15 range and
they are fucked and just growing max and
they're pumped to shit and they're sore
as fuck
and there's no going up from there so
when you see other per session volumes
people doing all 15 cents per session
per back like
yeah that's nice that ain't going to be
you and the stronger you get the less
it's going to be you
so just keep that in mind you're going
to want to gravitate a little bit more
to that
hit style of training less frequency
less exposure set wise not necessarily
closer to failure because you also have
to respect that as well
your training is going to look on paper
very easy but because you're more fast
which you're going to gain strength so
fast you're going to get so strong
that it'll be quote unquote look easy
with hundreds and hundreds of pounds
versus some other people that
do 15 sets of workout with an average of
80 pounds and it's like okay
you could actually do their workout in
five minutes if you wanted to
yeah and just so if anyone was kind of
tuning in and out listening to this just
to clarify something so people don't get
the wrong idea
it's we we might see somebody increasing
their intensity on this progression more
because
it's so easy to overshoot also with the
volume because their mevs are already so
low
adding a set or two might actually just
take them right over the edge so if
anybody's like dr michael i thought you
said
that's week to week what do you mean
that we're talking about like a very
niche case here of somebody who's really
really fast twitch
and their load uh volume load
progression will actually just come from
weight on the bar and that's just enough
to keep it going rather than adding a
set which might be way too much
overreach no good 100
uh number two what are your thoughts on
direct uh adductor training worth it
waste the time of somewhere between the
outer security large muscles right under
thigh master action yeah that's right
girl machine
really round out how your legs look when
viewing from the front are squat
variants enough to actually grow the
adductors should be hitting them
directly if it's worth training them at
all so actually this is a question that
you
have to answer for yourself uh for some
people training editors they can do
extra volume and they need extra volume
and they can actually go to benefit from
them
some people involve the editor so much
squatting that extras may be a limiting
factor for them
and the recovery for squatting they
actually have to do things like leg
extensions and close
close stance leg press doesn't do very
few lunges or anything like that to keep
their adductors
within their mrv which i'm in that case
actually so
uh it's really a guess and check kind of
thing explore um
there's there's no categorical answer to
that i will say though my average answer
is when you squat deep with the
appropriate stances and do lunges for
glutes and hip thrusts and when you do
um deep leg presses and hack squats i
would say
my rough stupid off the cuff guess is 90
of cases
no additional adductor work is ever
necessary uh
james i agree and you might actually
find the same movement uh with different
variations
completely different so i've experienced
this myself cambered bar squats
no big deal on the adductors switch over
to barbell high bar squats
my mev is like one set because my
adductors become a limiting factor even
after having squatted cambar
for months and months and months that
particular variation
causes that to be a limiting factor that
might just be something unconsciously
that i'm doing
maybe maybe not who knows but you will
find that um that that might be the case
so i think for like mike said like 90
of people if you're doing some kind of
normal squat variation you probably got
that covered
and you know i have a really hard time
making a case for someone like i don't
know what a situation would arise where
i'd be like you know what
those adductors man we gotta do
something about this this
is fucked you know what i mean like when
has that ever happened
never unless you're like one of those
those
femme dom ladies who are trying to crush
watermelons
that might be a situation where i'd be
like you know what we gotta we gotta
work on this a little bit brush this
watermelon she's like i can't you're
like
this fucking adductor is usable get on
that cable stack
god all right number three more of a
clarification question my understanding
is that when training at mav
which is the biggest performance
increases all else being equal because
we're getting the most hypertrophic
stimulus relatively fatigue generated
no mav is maximum adaptive volume not
best sfr
those are two different things uh but
we'll get to that in a second
at mev we should see smaller increases
because the hypertrophic stimulus is
smaller even though there is less
fatigue in the mrv
we should see small no increases in
performance because the fatigue is so
high despite a very large hypertrophic
stimulus
am i understanding this correctly so
over the meso cycle average
if you take a whole mesocycle and you
see on average we trained at mav
yes you would see the biggest
performance increases after the deload
and the cumulative fatigue has come down
right um that's completely correct and
mav average for the motorcycle does in
fact
have the highest stimulus period
and it doesn't matter relative to
fatigue generated because the d-load
clears the fatigue anyway
if you want to have a higher stimulus
relatively generated you should probably
train close to mev the entire time
you would accumulate very little fatigue
but you also wouldn't better grow it all
you're saying this fatigue ratio would
be sweet but it'd be like yeah like if
you do this for another 150 years you'll
be mr olympia i'd be like i don't have
any
years i have 10. right so so that's the
technical answer there
and then he says if so what do you think
about only tracking performance
increases determined if you're at
mv medium if a mrv instead of tracking
performance increases in vision pumps
soreness rp et cetera it seems like
performance increases the best
correlation we have
to muscle growth based on recovery
adaptive model things like pumps and
soreness might be a little bit more
subjective and variable
so it's a really good point the problem
is uh and this is something that eric
helms and i've been going back and forth
on in our various debates over volume
uh the fitness fatigue paradigm
essentially guarantees
that within a mesocycle you're looking
at a black box
of uh attributing performance gains to
anything
so at any one time you actually have no
idea
if the performance gain you're
exhibiting is from an increase
in fitness or from a relative
non-accumulation of fatigue
right so you you can't actually tell
here's a really good case and point
example
you do the following motorcycle sets of
five oh sorry five sets of something
then three sets of something then one
set of something
then deload okay how what's your
performance going to do your performance
is going to be revolutionary you're
going to get the fucking the strongest
you've
ever been at the end of that motorcycle
now is that close to med no fuck no it's
way below and it's actually like an mv
um so what's going what's happening is
that your fatigue is dropping
uh while your fitness is probably just
the same uh
and then the paradigm there is that
you're prepared unless it's massive
because it's a difference in fitness
fatigue on the other hand
if you do a crazy cycle where you do
shit load of volume and you're growing
at your fastest ever under the hood
you could be accumulating so much
fatigue that you you get these tiny
little improvements micro cycle to micro
cycle and performance
and then the last micro cycle you don't
even improve in performance you're like
oh that's my mrv
then you deload and within that
mesocycle
you'd be like wow that was a shitty mess
like i trained wrong and you would
actually be making the opposite
conclusion because here let's take these
two medals we just lined up
and let's add a d-load week to the end
of them after the deal of week for the
531 meso i didn't mean to like
oh damn it yeah it just so happens right
but that's the thing is five two one's
not hypertrophy program it's a peaky
program right
after a deload week after that you
probably wouldn't get any stronger
you'd be the same uh a d-load week after
this
cycle of the the accumulated volumes you
would get
massively stronger after the deal
because all that
stimulus has gone to increasing your
fitness but
also increase your fatigue and then the
fatigue drops and the the stuff stays
so we absolutely should be tracking
performance increases to determine mvmrv
100 after each mesocycle is over
but that means we have to fly blind for
an entire mesocycle
which is dumb as shit we just don't have
to do because we can have some kind of
and
you're right subjective not exactly
perfect some kind of hint
imagine imagine this world you don't
know if you're doing enough volume
okay but you never get pumps you never
get sore
and you do a whole message cycle and
then you find that your performance
didn't increase after a delay did you
not do enough volume yes it was not
enough but motherfucker you should have
known that shit you were barely even
trying
right here's another one you get pumps
like you could
can't believe can't move pumps soreness
to the point where it's overlaps to
every single session you ever do you're
sore like literally for the entire five
weeks
did you do enough volume yes did you do
too much
yes probably so if you don't get
stronger after that like dude you were
at mrv or above the entire time
so that way performance
has to be something performance is the
only way to detect mrv
within the mesocycle but other than
detecting mrv within the mesocycle
performance cannot be used comparatively
to gauge rate of adaptation
because the fitness fatigue paradigm
blocks everything out mesoderms and meso
after the deloads it's the only way to
gain progress because like
for example let's say you told james and
i look i did three mesos with dealers
back to back to back and i gained no
strength am i getting bigger would be
like
fuck no right it'd be like well on this
program i got 15 pounds of strength on
my reps for bench and on this other
program i've got 25 at the same time
which one's better be like the 25
one because after the d load clearly
there's some shit happening under the
hood right
but uh within microcycle the microcycle
the microcycle if you completely just
choose to ignore
uh soreness and uh pump and all this
other perceptive
measures then you're flying sort of
needlessly blind uh that's it and you
could be fucking up for it takes you a
whole mess to find out you were fucking
up
uh it shouldn't take that long yeah i i
agree with dr mike here so the thing is
like performance of all the things that
you could pick performance probably
would be the one if you could only pick
one but the problem is that you don't
need to pick one and picking one is kind
of silly
there's no metric whether we're talking
about fatigue performance
anything within those two spectrums
there's no one metric that
is tells you everything that you need to
know so you know our stance
and i've been a big advocate of this for
a long time is that if you're going to
have some type of monitoring system you
should have performance metric
you should have some type of
physiological metric whether that's a
heart rate or
even just taking some anthros or some
body comps anything body weight it's
fine yeah body weight yeah that's fine
um and a perceptive measure whether
that's just kind of like an rpe
or like a you know a likert scale
questionnaire anything like that like if
you don't have one of each of those
things you're probably missing out on
something let me give you a quick
example
um your performance is increasing
measurement
your weight is stable or going up slowly
and you're getting sore every single
time you train but you recover
comfortably with room to spare before
your next session
that is your fucking checklist do you
want to lob off any one of those
you know like imagine you're getting
sworn healing on time and imagine you're
getting stronger but you're getting
smaller are you really comfortably
confident that those are not neural
gains that you're gaining muscle i
wouldn't be
imagine that you're you know getting
stronger and so on and so forth
but you're barely ever getting sore
maybe you could be getting stronger if
you actually challenge the muscle more
you could be getting even bigger
so all of those are and of course if
you're not getting stronger at all or
you have no idea because you never check
performance well
god you're completely flying long-term
blind which is really really stupid
so strength and performance is one of
those things that's more of a long-term
it's more confirmatory as to whether or
not you're on the right track
and it is the most objective and the
most important but we can do better
than uh just checking it like it's
almost like saying you know you'll know
when you've arrived to your destination
if you look around and there you are
like yeah no shit but turn by turn
you know what i'm saying probably even
if you have a map it's good to sort of
know where you are
now can you see your location from all
those turns no but there are some hints
along the way
i'll put you this way here's a really
really good example um you're driving
uh you live in the mountains in colorado
and a friend invited you to a party down
the plains in colorado
okay and you like have the directions
but you know like you're in colorado so
the fucking satellite flips out all the
time there's not coverage on your phone
like i think i'm on the right road
here's a question for you that would be
like the equivalent of a pump and
someone is perceptive
are you generally going downhill because
if you're going uphill all the time and
you have to ask yourself if you're on
the right track but you're probably
not you know like well my friend lives
5000 feet below me
but for the last half hour i've been
going uphill in a winding road am i in
the right track
do you need to get to a destination
finally open up the satellite and be
like oh shit i've been driving around
wrecks for 30 minutes
probably not just like if someone asked
you have you been training hard enough
this last meso
and you never ever got sore or a pump
don't be surprised when the answer is no
you haven't been training hard enough at
the end of it
you can do better than that for sure
this question made me think of the why
not zoidberg mean
meme the best political campaign
ever yeah zoidberg oh my god i gotta
start watching futurama again zoidberg's
the fucking man
oh man quote unquote doctor
like are you a real doctor zoidberg he's
like what is it to you
i like when he accidentally cuts
people's limbs off with his clients
or he assumes uh the humans have like
squid-like physiology
he's like that's where your thorax
should be they're like what and they're
like oh
i guess that humans are different never
mind uh all right and then uh and then
he says
thank you for all your hard work uh you
have no idea how much
your content would help me i appreciate
you both thank you so much glad to hear
that all right
cartex thing it's the shortest question
of all time this is actually uh
uh most more of a statement than
anything yeah
my goal is bodybuilding and i have i
left it i left it i couldn't help it i
was like
i was so tempted to just like let this
one go but i couldn't
my goal is bodybuilding i have very
limited equipment at my gym for legs i
only
uh got squat rack and leg press how can
i rotate exercises
uh you know what i'm saying you're gonna
have to rotate the shit between leg
press and hack squat my dude
but on a serious note okay you could do
leg press with a wider stance with a
closer stance you could do milo wrap leg
press you could do a regular leg press
uh you could do heavier leg press uh you
could do lighter leg press and you could
do all the same shit with squats except
for the rep squats might not work out so
well for you
so i would uh focus on having those
kinds of rotations
different positions different um uh foot
widths and different rep schemes and
some ireps and stuff thrown in there
some supersets and all of a sudden
you've got years and years of variation
to mail account yeah
yeah i mean even just with the squat
alone you have dozens of potential
variations just between like bar
placement foot placement and implement
that you could potentially use to do the
squats like
there's no shortage of things and not to
mention even just like tempo
variations weight variations stuff like
that pauses
you got a lot of room there with even
just those two things
all right irene salam says hey
doctors and he has a couple of questions
for us
number one can sup james i'm gonna rapid
fire these interrupt me if you need
anything quick
it sounded like trump for some reason
you know you uh
you should be getting sore i know
everything about pumps
if i made the pump you have bleach that
we put into the covet virus
people think they know about hypertrophy
eric helms
thinks he knows things but he's an idiot
oh my god
james s trump versus eric helms in a
debate eric could be all reasonable and
polite
this is yeah this is you know what
i watch your program and it's bad next
question
it's like no one's even asked a question
you're like uh okay
um all right number one
can some muscles just not get sore i
feel like if i get a crazy burden pump
in my lats and delts they just wouldn't
be sore
uh uh the other day but my chest and
quads can easily be sore yep
for a variety of reasons some muscles uh
get sore more easily than others or more
regularly
uh which is why soreness is not the
be-all and all uh of everything
so uh what we always say is if you are
progressing
in strength a mesoderm if you're getting
great pumps and you feel like the muscle
has lost a ton
within a session a ton of strength uh
then you're stimulating the fuck out of
it and it's okay if it does never get
sore
uh the thing is that if you're not
training with a high volume
if you don't get a huge burn if you
don't get really big pumps and you're
not getting sore you're probably just
not doing enough on the other hand
if you're not getting crazy burn you're
not getting crazy pumps but you are
getting pretty fucking sore
we wouldn't do more than that so
soreness doesn't cover all the bases but
it covers some
number two we usually hear people say
good or bad genetics the sense of
absolutes besides skeleton shape and
muscle insertions what factors term are
good genetics i'm gonna have a youtube
video about that in some time
i've already written a powerpoint for it
um two things
that come to mind is initial conditions
how much muscle do you have to begin
with
uh and potential rate of adaptation is
how fast you grow
uh and then a third one is your limit
size like number of
muscle fiber cells you have and their uh
full expanded
size before the myonuclear domain
ceiling caps them uh
that can those three alone can be
different so for example you have
someone that starts out really jacked
but they're not very growth responsive
and their muscle cell number is very low
then they won't get that much bigger
but you have someone that starts out
pretty small and they have a crazy
growth response and a shitload of
satellite cells
uh then they can actually get fucking
enormous the best genetics or someone
that starts out big
has a great growth response and has a
huge um
satellite cell pool those people get the
biggest and then of course testosterone
myostatin all those are the factors
contribute incrementally along the way
so there's tons of things there's no
such thing as good imagination that's a
fucking wild fallacy
their genetics of spectrum is normally
distributed uh most people are pretty
average you're gaining muscle some
people are real shit but those people
are pretty rare
and some people are gods and most people
are pretty rare and their names are
jared feather
yeah we didn't even get into the
psychological basis for genetics
in in this case either which place i
would say just a very not not an equal
role but a very large role as well
do you have the workbook liberty
psychology to actually do a program
because if you don't doesn't fucking
matter how great your genetics are
yeah or do you even have any interest in
it at all
[Laughter]
all right number three i'm 167 pounds at
12
13 body fat 175 centimeters with 60
months of training i don't have skinny
genetics but i have no problem staying
at that fat mass and uh ever i started
training for muscle size
just the first week of training is like
i haven't gained any measurable fat
could that be science uh
that i can eat more and gain more or by
some miracle i'm eating the perfect
amount
uh it's definitely not i don't know what
the perfect amount means
but if you are maintaining a lean
physique training hard and eating well
but you want to gain weight eat a little
bit more to gain weight you're going to
find out one way or another and it's
okay you gain a little bit of fat when
you gain weight
just when you start gaining too much fat
cut it off maintain for a bit
diet off the fat and repeat the cycle
that's it
yeah and the thing is like if you're not
gaining fat at some point something's
definitely wrong and you're kidding
yourself
you know what i mean at that point you
might be being a little fat phobic on
the diet side of things i'm not saying
you should become fucking
jabba the hutt but at the same you know
if you uh do two months and you
don't gain any appreciable fat it's like
okay that seems kind of
uh james you and i are going to leave
the location and the name of this person
out but james and i interaction with the
person once
who was like that person weighed like
120 pounds and they were like i ate like
4 500 calories a day and i can't gain
weight and james and i like
rolled our eyes so hard that our eyes
left our heads and met
and i got james's eyes and he got mine
[Laughter]
and then and then dr melissa davis was
with us and she just had a temporary
death she just fell backwards and hit
her head
so it was like yeah word up you know
what i'm saying there's a terrible
problem you got there
yeah most people who who say that are
people who will eat like one
really liars well that too that's the
more obvious thing but they'll also eat
like one big meal a day and think that
they're eating like all these calories
but then they don't eat the rest of the
day and so
the reality is they're not actually
accruing that much calories throughout
number four i can grow my calves with
three sets a week and i'm wondering
if i should try zero sets a week and see
if they stay the same
i walk 12 000 steps just for fun and
when i feel like it
so only if you want to know if your
maintenance volume is zero
but it might be but if you want to keep
your caps growing
i would just say stick within that lower
set range
unless you want to go faster and then
experiment with slightly higher volumes
incrementally
it depends on like if you want to deal
with calves or not like i personally
don't want to deal with calves anymore i
hate training cabs and uh some people
like having big caps it's up to you
number six so about the isometric trap
holes
i moved to a new gym where they don't
have trap bar
trap bars or machine shrugs and barbell
shrugs and i don't feel my traps at all
uh
when i end the movement i feel like i'm
just tired so i'm resorting back to the
asymmetric cold for a while i have two
questions
one should i just aim at increasing time
each week or weights on sets
both uh all three
honestly i can't i can't i can't even
say that because i think it's still
a waste it's one of those things where
it's i don't know it's like
how do i make something shitty less
shitty
like well why don't you just not do the
shitty thing
number two
when do i know where to stop a set uh
lol if i go to failure
uh failure hits when my traps tear apart
well it's not gonna hit when your traps
tear apart
um i would objectively raise your
shoulders to a certain height
so maybe stand in front of the mirror
and pick like a speck on the mirror and
when you do this your shoulder on the
right hand side and left touch
a certain spec or touch a certain line
stand in front of or behind a machine
like in a reflection right and then
completely cover
the machine behind you just barely with
your traps and hold them hold them hold
them and then when you can see the
machine again
that's failure because the traps have uh
depressed to some extent
uh that's it you've got to be objective
you could use some
something like a smith machine too which
is really easy to see what you're doing
especially if there's a mirror right and
something like that you can just look at
all the different pegs and stuff and
it's an easy reference point
yep um
yeah very good point james uh
all right update oh he said i literally
are you guys for all this information
you make me know how to improve on the
one thing i love most yeah you literally
do always motherfuckers to send
a hundred dollars uh check be able to
extreme hardcore fitness solutions
uh uh halberd oregon five five six five
one
uh with uh uh re timothy spencer
and um just just do that every month
we need that money timothy needs money
update the horse's name doctor mike is
retail feels awkward to ride so i just
leash it
no it's getting oddly sexual doesn't
want to romp around
you i would love it if you rode me irene
damn hey you know what
to say uh all right
ellie paulin says hello
uh my 60 year old healthy father started
exercising on the elliptical five months
ago
he's doing four to five sessions a week
each 1.5 to 2 hours long
fucking and an average
beats per minute of 140 which is 88 of
his maximal heart rate he perceives the
effort as moderate and is never pushing
himself
dad has a gift no legit
uh can he sustain that routine without
looking at damaging effects on his heart
damaging
he's going to become god sooner or later
i've been told that exercising for
longer periods of time
in this heart rate zone could be
detrimental for heartless pure
unadulterated bullshit um
if your dad cleans up his diet a tiny
bit
he's gonna become lean as fuck fit as
shit he's probably already well on his
way to becoming fit as fuck anyway he
might already be lean
if he perceives it as totally fine and
not super fatiguing
dude this is the healthiest shit you
could fucking imagine uh what you have
to just talk to your dad about is
for him not to psycho tough guy this but
if he feels tired
take a week off or take a week of maybe
doing 30 minutes at 120 beats per minute
just some easy time do some hiking do
some other stuff take a little break not
fuck his joints up but other than that
if he's
just realistic with his fatigue
perception this is the healthiest
if we could have america and the rest of
the western world do what your dad is
doing or work up to it over several
years
i said not everyone's gonna be able to
do that five months into training
they would be there would be almost no
fucking heart disease for like another
six
000 people a year and fucking cancer
rates to fall back this is amazing your
dad is the fucking shit
uh do not stop him from doing this just
make sure he's realistic about his
fatigue
both centrally and perfectly with regard
to joints but this is the
i'm telling you heart health is is
literally
improved to a huge extent by what he's
doing not damaged in the least
and if you have time um well we shouted
down the rp plus component here but if
you want to pop into the youtube at some
point
in a few weeks and just let us know
remind us about who you were
let us know where you found that this is
bad for the heart type of bullshit
because i really like to see the fuck
i think i know what she's talking about
i was gonna pop in on that so there is
like a great
a very small grain of truth uh it's just
not in the same context here so
uh doing a lot of hard cardiovascular
training can actually have negative
effects on heart health
just like doing a lot of hard muscle
training can eventually cause a lot of
problems to your muscle it's the same
idea
um but that's really an issue of like
systemically overreaching and
uh it's like really really this is
something that like elite endurance
athletes can run into they'll start
seeing problems with their heart rate
variability and stuff like that
what you're doing is or excuse me what
your father is doing is nowhere
near the ballpark of that so long as
that he's like mike said realistic with
his perceptions of fatigue and recovery
and if he's if he's cruising and
otherwise good no problems at all it's
really when you start
pushing the limits of how much endurance
training that you can tolerate
and at you know at very very high
intensities relatively speaking
that's when you can start running into
some issues but it's no different it's
the same
it's the same shit that we talk about
mrv mev all that it's the same thing
repackaged in a slightly different
modality so if you're conscious of these
things
you don't have to worry about it too
much
all right anch no longer do we get on
shiman radhakrishnan we get just one
it's just me being lazy
it's oh he oh he put in his whole name
his name shows up this full name shows
up on the thing i'm just
everyone knows you got a long name i
don't want to type it out and then i
have to always go back and make sure i'm
not misspelling it
and if and if you don't know who aunt
is soon your world will
[Laughter]
you know how like you will comment the
coming of the comment portends calamity
ain't no comment motherfucker that's
ashamed of krishna headed to your
fucking planet bro oh my god
he says and then he asks us a question
that has already been asked so we'll
just summarize really quickly
uh do you guys think it's everywhere
four gold training i've also grew up in
a certain rep range to poor so far for
example a wrist starter here my rear
delts triceps in the five to ten range
close grip bet so so here's a actually
cool thing for you and you already hit
your rear delts and triceps in the five
to ten range because you do pulling
movements
and pushing movements in the five to ten
range which
hit your rear belts and triceps like
crazy okay
so good news is you're already doing
that so it's kind of a trick answer
closer benching juices my chest much
more than my triceps for example and
face pulls and rear laterals turn into
back movements more than anything else
in the 10 to 20 20 30 rep range things
are golden sometimes even on the same
exercise but the five to ten rep range i
can't perceive anything that happens all
right yes ash we've actually answered
this question already before the answer
is
twofold one if you're doing nothing to
expose the muscle at all in any compound
movements or anything else any
assistance moves
to a certain rep range it's totally fine
to forego it for some time
multiple mesos but every now and again
every few blocks come around to trying
something maybe at the high end or the
low end of that reparation you never
feel
and see if maybe a new exercise new
technique it works out because you might
be pleasantly surprised like oh wow i
actually feel it now
um this is super cool so don't ever
write it off forever
but you can write it off for like half a
year a year at a time uh
but to answer your question more
directly you're not
uh not uh james are those the doggies
oh yeah they're barking doggies
when do they start barking they they
started immediately
like as soon
the females gotten fucking huge like
just she's just been putting
like she's already gained like almost
three pounds since we got her and she
started
ten so she's like she's getting like 33
percent of her body weight do they
eat lowe's food no we i we have like
there's like a there's like a low zone
in the house so that low stuff is always
safe and he can escape if he wants to
but they they've been interacting a lot
lois tries to eat their food but he
doesn't like it he's like
[Laughter]
um sorry okay so where was i uh you're
already
in most muscle groups you're already
training things in all the rep ranges
it's the real question is with dedicated
isolation movements are you training
well rep ranges and the answer there is
no not necessarily so um remember
back work and pushing and pulling work
generally already trains
your rear and uh and front belts with
the hardcore heavy volume
that they're going to need and then
everything on top of that is isolation
um
and a lot of times it's not the rep
range there it's the technique breaks
down completely if you try to go heavier
which is why
it ends up being a poor situation where
the time uh you know because it's such a
short amplitude exercise then
the time spent generating tension is so
small that you just don't get close to
your your local muscular
volume nearly enough um but other than
that it's good to go
uh and then most of the time you don't
have a problem
with the rep ranges so so yeah to answer
your question yeah you can for months at
a time
even get off the isolation wagon for
some muscle groups but come back every
now and again and see if there's
anything there
yeah and you can always buy us towards
the top end of this you know like the 8
to 10 kind of
reps if you if you feel like you get
something out of that rather than
nothing
all right this is quite a few questions
i'm gonna rapid fire these cool james
yeah fire away
montes billy pouches says uh hello
doctors i hope it won't be hard for you
to answer approximately one question
tell if i'm mad about that or not
clearly it was sarcasm
it's that lithuanian sarcasm everyone
loves
that's a dream of hibiscus uh i have an
injured calf
muscle but i feel good you're like what
what yeah uh all right number one
why is tazio ill beyond
one of the best people at pull ups in
the world but he does not look like he
lifts
his explainable by a large portion of
slow twitch muscle fibers no clue don't
know who he is
but i suspect that uh fiber type neural
recruitment abilities
and sometimes anatomical insertions and
origins really really determine stuff
so if we take your lats and we position
them like one centimeter or even half a
centimeter further
down the humerus your lat your pulling
strength increases by like some
fucking ungodly amount which is why like
chimps are actually quite slow if you
try to get them to run
um but humans are the the fastest of the
primates on on foot
but chimps are super fucking strong
because they're anatomically leveraged
just a bit further from the joint
uh which means they're shitty at
producing power and speed but their
strength is really high so like 150
pound chip it looks like
you look like you could fuck it up it
might be actually stronger than you
which is a scary thought chips are scary
as fuck you know they smile a lot but
that's actually them bearing their teeth
i don't like them i don't like i don't
ever want to be around monkeys ever i
mean they can literally rip each other
to pieces it's
very scary yeah and they go through for
the face eyes
and nuts when they when they fight you
so it's just like some kind of like
that's like a demon i'm pretty sure
that's how demons came to be
mythologized i don't know who this guy
is either so i don't really have
anything else to input but you know
there's always things like power to
weight ratios
anthropometry like mike said stuff like
that who knows
number two is there any correlation
between time it takes to heal wounds and
the ability to carve versus training
absolutely
uh here's a correlation protein intake
uh my wife was actually telling me more
if it's a medical doctor
that they scale protein requirements in
the hospital
uh based on how big your wound is that
you're coming in to heal and if you have
a huge wound uh
like internal wound they give you more
protein so i was just talking about you
honey
i'm at a webinar so uh
basically uh you know what else does
protein intake help well it helps
recovery from training
so and probably you know when you get
sick you can't recover from training as
much because more is going to wound
healing and things like that
and i think genetically underlying the
same people that can recover quickly
from wound healing probably better
recovered from training and there's a
lot of overlap there because a lot of
those basic systems are the same
not all of them but a lot of the same
yeah so like theoretically yes i've
never seen
a single paper so when you say
correlation you have
that that would indicate like that that
was was statistically measured right and
so uh so to from on my end i have not
seen anything
but like dr mike says a lot of those
systems overlap so it would make sense
and if i read a paper that said that
i'd be like yeah that seems like it
would make a lot of sense but i
personally have not so i can't really
comment on that
three why does nobody do cluster sets
for strength training tons of people do
cluster steps or strength training
not sure where that came from number
four how should your preparedness
fluctuate in the mesocycle
should you be in the best shape right
after dealing with starting a new
training block yes
um or a few micro cycles in once you've
gotten the real swag of the movements
but you should definitely be not in your
highest preparedness at the end of a
mesocycle because if you're a high
preparedness at the end
what is it that you're actually doing to
incur fatigue you're probably not
training hard enough
number five should i be concerned about
overreaching if i see a drop of
explosiveness even though my strength
is steadily climbing up yes you should
uh james and i have an article that i
have actually just transferred into a
youtube video i'm gonna be recording in
probably a few months because we have
such a huge backlog of videos we'll put
them out
um the uh what the fuck fatigue
indicators and how to use them on
juggernaut strength
and we described um for strength
training explosiveness is a leading
indicator of fatigue
so you can still be getting stronger but
your explosiveness once it starts to go
down
you can tell that you're not at your mrv
yet but it's coming soon
so it's one of those like you don't just
ignore it you're like oh i feel a little
slower
okay i'm one or two weeks left or i
better better manage my fatigue pretty
well
and it also depends on what you're
training for like if you're training for
hypertrophy then
if your explosiveness goes down that's
like a completely normal trade-off at
that point and it might have very little
impact on what you're doing but as mike
said it is a leading indicator that you
are becoming fatigued but that's one of
those kind of like a no-brainer ones
were like man i can't jump aside i was
like yeah you did fucking eight sets of
quads yesterday
number six uh what should a usual
decrease in performance
uh when eliminating the stress
shortening cycle my broad job that's 350
centimeters see the broad jump is 305 is
that difference too small i'm not
actually sure it actually depends
the difference is very very lift and
exertion specific so if the
threshold recycle it impacts some things
much more than others i'm not sure if
james
do you know anything about this for the
broad jump i i'm sorry i spaced out for
a second i gotta
reread it stress shortening cycle versus
no stress shortening cycle what's the
typical
uh difference there and i said it's very
specific to the lift or the exercise
yeah i'm not sure and it's also going to
be specific to how the person performs a
lot of those techniques some people get
more out of the elastic component some
people get more out of like just like
the raw force generation component
it's hard to say uh
number seven it takes me 260
milliseconds to perform a broad jump
beginning counter movement to leave in
the ground
the plyometric exercises that have about
100 milliseconds of contact time
have a noteworthy carry over to my bra
jump uh yeah anything that has a plan
that has a counter movement component
can be improved by plyometrics
uh although plyometrics technically
improve your rebound
much better than they improve your
ability to to do a counter movement
so yes there absolutely will be an
increase the increase will be greatest
when you're already
really really muscular and really really
strong uh
and it won't be a huge improvement if
you just start doing playoffs when
you're not that strong
james
yeah but the ground contact time is
something that's useful
for things like sprinting um in terms of
just doing like a broad jump i
i wouldn't because the the ground
contact time on a broad jump is massive
because you're just sitting there
winding up and then leaping
so i wouldn't put too much stock into
that particular metric for a broad jump
[Music]
number eight some people like to
recommend triphasic training for
athletic activities is it preferable to
conventional microcycle that james
discussed and applied periodization
training
or privatization lectures i'm just going
to go ahead and say triphasic training
is a bullshit
advertising term it's a dog shit program
that's not even a fucking program it's a
fucking gimmick book
sorry i was going to be civil about this
but this i don't know i'm not trying to
i've seen what tracking
i've seen students present to me when i
was a professor as a noteworthy training
strategy and it makes no internal or
external sense as far as i can tell them
so
yeah i mean i honestly couldn't even
tell you what
what it is so i'm not really sure i mean
i've heard of it and i i've
it's come in and out of my my world a
few times but i've never looked at it
very seriously so
i don't know i haven't it's mostly dog
sure i've
ever gotten back to mike's word on that
number nine how does the curve of a
recovery window look
is there a big difference if you relax
just when you step out of the gym
or after an hour um generally speaking
it depends on how much stress you're
incurring in that hour
the sooner you can relax the better and
the more stress you experience before
you get a chance to relax the more
deleterious it is to approach your
hypertrophic processes
now remember recovery occurs over the
course of days so one hour's not going
to make a
huge difference um but the more
you can relax the better and the more
you can make not relaxing things
relaxing better so for example
if you are in a car driving home after
workout for 45 minutes or something like
that
uh best to throw on your favorite
podcasts of music and relax and not
get pissed off at the traffic then get
really pissed off and angry and try to
drive fast because that will make a
small difference
in your performance
yeah so i agree with mike here um i
think it's one of those where we would
say there's a practical significance is
it something that
would be like a statistically
significant difference probably not
because there's too many factors
involved in recovery like lifestyle
training nutrition
other you know just it's impossible to
measure
should unilateral exercises be involved
in my training if i train for the broad
jump
james um it depends on what you mean
like
are you talking about like just doing
unilateral leg training or anything like
that i mean
so the broad jump is a bilateral
exercise so in that sense
it would you you would not necessarily
need to
although you can get plenty of explosive
training out of doing some unilateral
stuff i would say um
and i think dr mike shares largely
shares the same opinion on training in
general
i think the majority of your training
should come from bilateral stuff you
should have some stuff that's high force
output the way that you do that is of
course by doing bilateral
you should have some high power output
stuff and big surprise how do you
generate high power output
uh bilateral and you can supplement some
unilateral stuff if you feel like you
get a really really good sfr stimulus
out of it but other than that
i think uh the majority of your work
should probably be bilateral
yeah and it would be different
if he said sorry i was just like i was
just thinking like it might be different
if it was like a long jump
right where you sprint up and then you
bound off of a leg
so you have the sprint component which
might benefit from unilateral training
and kind of the single leg bound
which might benefit but a broad jump it
has like a massive ground contact time
the impulse is fucking huge just because
you're winding up
squatting and then leaping in like
i so i'm just not seeing it yeah
somebody could make a case to me and say
yeah you could i get a lot out of this
particular like
one-legged jump or bound or sprint and
i'd say okay that's fine but for the
most part if i saw
a program that didn't have a lot of high
bar squats and like maybe like clean
variations something like that i would
be very suspicious
all right
are there any drawbacks to training only
the range of motion that is required for
the broad jump
i do box and pin squats my etg squad is
so weak that i have to mutually slow
down to get out of the hole
but i accelerate frequently fast when i
pass parallel which almost leads to jump
squat
so the one downside is because your
stimulus to fatigue ratio for
hypertrophy
and maybe even for general strength
improvements could be higher in a full
squat because
you have to use less load to get the
same effect uh less bar load less
quality on the lockout and so on and so
forth so
you can absolutely do mostly if not holy
boxing
spots when you get close to your basic
strength and peaky faces but in hybrid
phases in a much basic strength fuller
squats are probably going to
make a little bit more sense for you
yeah i agree that would be something you
could periodize with your squat
movements where you have periods of
fuller range of motion and then as you
get closer and closer to
whenever it is that you want to do your
jump you could start training specific
ranges of motion
there's direct research to confirm this
in multiple studies uh
full rom groups gain more strength in
partial rom exercises than partial raw
groups because the partial wrong group
is just not much volume it's not much
hypertrophic stimulus so they gain so
little
muscle they end up not getting much
stronger even though the specificity is
good
yeah it's one of those where that's why
we rank the training principles and
there's not one
that is like the training principle like
if your overload is incredible
and your fatigue management is
incredible even a lower specificity can
lead to lower
better overall gains than if your
specificity is 100 but your overload
sucks and your fatigue management sucks
that's basically this example
uh 12 was rapid decreased performance
each set a sign of underlying fatigue
i would submit that it is not just a
sign of underlying fatigue it is a
literal measurement of fatigue that is
exactly what fatigue is decreased in
performance and subsequent performances
i said sometimes my first cycle smooth
but subsequent sets get much worse than
usually yeah it's a sign of underlying
fatigue uh now that fatigue might go
down if you rested longer
um but there's only so much of that it
saves uh so
absolutely it is yeah i mean
fatigue is literally a performance
decrement from
from doing the same thing at that point
you did something and then the next
one's got worse
easy-peasy number 13 i noticed that if i
do a slightly hard volume this workout
it gets much harder to fall asleep for a
few days
usually i fall asleep at 30 minutes
after a hard workout it takes roughly
two hours this is normal i work six
hours
just before i go to sleep yeah it's
normal uh some people are more sensitive
to it than others but you seem very
sensitive
and potentially i would examine if those
workouts aren't very very over the top
too hard but other than that i think
it's normal
that that's part of what's going on yeah
and that's a very common uh overreaching
symptom is restlessness and
inability to get high quality or
quantity sleep so
what you might be also doing is acutely
overreaching on some of those workouts
and
that is a common symptom i would say if
it's something that's happening
regularly
you might consider backing down some of
those workouts a little bit
number 14 how am i supposed to take naps
is that a trainable skill
you're not supposed to take naps but if
you are going to take them you take them
for 20 to 45 minutes at a time this is
trainable skill yes but it's not needed
i have never fallen asleep during a day
in less than two hours yes totally fine
look you don't nobody needs naps um
if you the the nap advice that james and
i give for people are people who insist
on taking them and really really like
them
we can optimize them by making them of a
good length of this and that and making
them they're sure they're up to the
right time so they do interfere with the
sleep cycle at all and get the most out
of them
but if you're a person who doesn't take
naps then you're not missing out on a
fucking thing
most people just don't need maps and
that's totally fine yeah
does micro loading help to progress on
lifts which by one rep max another 50k
would be better doing
bigger jumps but stay within the same
weight for longer no either one of those
is totally fine
just make sure that you're not ever
training in such a way that's too easy
remember you can also progress in
repetitions
uh that's another mode of progress but
for straight progress with smaller lifts
yeah i think uh micro loading is totally
totally fine yeah i think it's fine too
it just
is also one of those things that can get
needlessly fussy
whereas like adding reps is very simple
and practical
number 16 i feel that i should take a
deload
but i know after three weeks i'll have a
stressful week which will mess up my
training should i deload twice or maybe
do a slight reduction of volume in the
beginning and it completely deloaded in
the stressful week i would say that last
part is probably your best bet it's
night reduction
uh enough of a reduction to buy you
another two weeks of training and that
dealer finally
yeah that sounds good fuck hold on
sneeze i okay number 17 how to know when
an overreaching becomes non-functional
when you recover from it but your
performance does not improve
uh it's something you find out by trial
and error so
start overreaching on the easier side
just a little bit overreaching
and see if you increase any more uh
gain by adding amounts of overation so
reach for three days months and then try
to overreach for five days
and if if the five days doesn't improve
your performance over the three days
don't try seven
uh but uh if the five days improves your
performance erratically
over the uh three days and then try a
seven day overreach and then after the
seven if it's roughly equivalent to the
five
i just would go back to the five if the
seven is under the five performance-wise
you have non-functional overreached or
to be more clear less functionally
overreached
and then i wouldn't go any further and
generally we will call things
non-functional overreaching
when they were unplanned and not
accounted for right so you're in a
you're essentially in a state that you
did not plan on being in
uh it could be in in this case it's in
the bad side so
you can also say you have non-functional
overreaching when
you come into a session that you planned
on you know maybe you're wearing it a
little bit but you plan on having a
fairly normal training session and you
totally bombed
right that's an example um and then
everything else like dr mike said
um if you have an explosive lower body
is there a high chance that your whole
body has a high proportion of fast
switch muscle fibers yes
higher chance than average absolutely
but not guaranteed
um this is something you'd find out very
easily oh
so uh number 19 how fast does mvp change
in a motorcycle is the change roughly
linear
uh james and i have estimated even most
of
folks we've trained that mev uh with
very similar movements rep ranges and
volumes etc
probably goes up by one or two sets
every mesocycle
uh very very tiny okay so your med stays
your amy for
essentially another cycle and might go
up a little bit into the next meso so
it's one of those things that if your
mav at the beginning of a block
is 10 the enemy might be 13 or 14 at the
end of that block which is like three
mesos in a row and that's just because
you've been using the same exercises and
so on and so forth
uh and it might even not be that high
might be like 12 or something like that
you just have to
just keep an eye on it um that being
said the mvv is still the mev
so you don't ever want to really on
purpose without giving a lot of thought
train at your mbe the entire time so
people say like well maybe he doesn't go
up that fast so i can just do 10 sets
every
week like yeah if you want minimum gains
yes you can
but you probably don't want minimum
gains so yeah
check out how much should i train too if
you want more information on that kind
of stuff
uh is a proper good morning done only
low bar no absolutely not hyper good
mornings or a thing you can check out my
uh
instagram i do them all the time so uh
yeah
sometimes the low bar one just puts a
lot of uh leveraging on the glutes too
and you don't really get to train the
hamstrings as much
yep yep sometimes it just turns your
shoulders um
21 is it bad to get bruises at the
contact point when doing olympic cleans
probably not i think a lot of people get
that especially at first james any uh
i think there's there's probably a point
of uh diminishing returns where
you're you're just placing your hips so
far
forward that the amount of force is not
actually going up you're actually
pushing forward
and somebody like max aydah is probably
a better person to ask about that
my my understanding is like a little bit
of contact there is not a big deal and
probably a little bit of bruising our
remarks
but if you're really getting a lot of
hit on that you probably are just
placing your forces in the wrong
direction
should feet training me included to
improve raw jump does the flexibility of
feet matter a lot
no clue james i honestly don't know
in my opinion would be whatever
whatever training that you need in your
feet you get from broadchump training
yeah 23 should i worry about the fatigue
caused by landing in a broad jump
absolutely 100
landing fatigue is fucking massive uh
the number of
landings you take is actually what a lot
of people in sports science measure
versus how many takeoffs you take
so for example if you're doing training
where you're you're a gymnast
and you do a crazy jump over some kind
of implement but you land into a
like a foam ball pit they're really like
you can do a whole lot of those and be
totally fine
there's only so many landings you can
have even if you're not powering
landings if you're a cheerleader and you
get hoisted up on someone's shoulders
and then they push you you do a tuck and
then you land there's only so many
shits you've got for any one unit of
time so absolutely you should be
worried about it like in a sense like
jewish worry something that never leaves
you just parentally walk around carrying
a giant fucking voter waiting to die i'm
just kidding but seriously you don't
worry about it but absolutely it should
play into your training program design
yeah and the landing's the limiting
factor on that exercise and it's
trainability
is a weighted vest uh training just a
fun way to spice up your workouts does
that provide unique pep benefits i think
neither
weight invest training is good for when
you need a weighted vest to do something
and other than that weighted vest
training
is you just wanted to look like a navy
seal
yeah i mean if you need weights to do
like pull-ups and dips or something or
push-ups like that's great uh but
they're like
putting it on for a squat or something
like that to me is is largely
silly um there could be something there
but i
certainly don't know what it is
that's it man the end of rp plus
oh that's right we're calling are we
calling it a day
and next time goodness folks next time
youtube
like and comment under the questions
that you think are the best and we will
get to as many of
we get to 10 questions each time and
we'll get to as
many of the top questions as fall into
that 10.
yeah the youtube algorithm sucks it
doesn't actually sort the highest
responses all the way to the top every
time but we're going to choose from the
top group of responses
and make sure that we're not chronically
missing any questions
that are getting upvoted a lot
yeah and also just let's be good
community members too like there's going
to be plenty of people who
maybe haven't watched uh three years of
webinars like many of you rp plus people
have so no need
to bash them if they ask something
simple like what's an mvv you know
stuff like that it's gonna happen yeah
help them out it's gonna happen it's no
need to like
shit on people like people wanna post
and ask questions that's fine we won't
answer all of them
but there's no need to be you know mean
don't be mean
come on now let's uh man i can't believe
we uh that's the last
rp plus one man that's kind of funny
crazy crazy
times are changing indeed folks uh we're
gonna sign off for this one so just
one last time remember we're gonna
switch to youtube so you're gonna go on
the most
recent episode of the webinar which will
be this one
we recorded this one on july 21st so
hopefully i think it'll be labeled that
way
so that's when you're going to start
posting your youtube comments and
questions and then upvote down vote
whatever you want don't downvote that's
mean but upvote
comment all that stuff we'll get to it
and then that's how we're gonna answer
from this point on so i'm dr james
he's dr mike we are signing off
