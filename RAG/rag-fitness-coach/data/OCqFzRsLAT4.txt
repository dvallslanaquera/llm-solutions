[Music]
so you have the real pull down looks
like
[Music]
hey guys these guys are holding breath
for the whole interest i have to turn up
my super jewish ability to talk really
fast we're gonna do back we're gonna do
pull downs we're gonna do rows we're
gonna do pull-ups we're gonna all that
stuff but charlie and i have to do cavs
before that so let's get started welcome
to rp boom
hey guys
we're gonna be like what the fuck caps
first
just to get them out of the way i'd do
them sometime right now i'm doing caps
three times a week
monday wednesday friday
so
i had a heavier calf situation monday
now it's wednesday
lighter calves i typically do very very
little rest between sets here like 10
seconds
four or five sets usually gets the job
done full range of motion is always
super emphasis on the stretch
let's get it done
fuck
i didn't even know that was a feature
it's a lot of setup
a lot of setup just to train cast
it's a lot of bullshit you know
you just do this
shut the fuck up
yeah if i trained my calves by just
walking i'd also think that
[Music]
[Music]
i put those hips forward
all right
people think it's hard training legs
calves
you should do a youtube video like
brutal calf workout from hell
you just like cgi some demons running
around
[Music]
fuck you jared
what's he doing back there
i guess we'll have to wait for the final
video to see
what does jared do behind mike's back
find out next time
scott look at this stupid shit
this dumb idiot brought a banana to
training what you gonna do with that
thing
sit on it
sit on it
just like so it squishes or so it goes
in your butthole
second ah
my calves
are a muscle group which i completely
transformed
in high school
one of my friends gave me a nickname and
it was chicken legs
first of all i didn't train my legs at
all and second of all my calves were
tiny
just little little sticks and now
my my calves actually match the rest of
my body
which is kind of sweet so like i've made
huge progress
it's kind of interesting because it's
just been growing
pretty steadily the entire time but i
will say
when i found out that short rest breaks
and higher reps
and a super db centric work super well
for cavs
in addition to the fact that i would
only get sore for like a day or two
and then i would just train again so
that two to four times a week frequency
versus like one time a week or calf
it made a huge difference for me
and i see a lot of folks out there
trying to get their calves to grow they
do calves
at the tail end of their leg workout
which is another thing i do my caps
first as you guys can tell and then i
have maximum energy for it
so i can really make a big impact
it's kind of trippy because a lot of
folks are
training the cavs at the end of a one
time a week leg workout and like
that's just not going to cut it calves
are similar to your forearms biceps
shoulders
they can take a beating they can recover
fast and if that's the case for you man
fuck them up
there's hope that's where you do them oh
my god oh yeah why are there so many
spiders in here dude what's the spider
fire biting
that's what it sounded like
oh those are sexual yeah
i'll get five i don't know if i can do
these
i'm not strong enough
i'm too heavy you are strong enough
charlie don't you ever say
you're a fighter charlie it's what you
do ow you fight
oh my elbow hurts so much
ow maybe don't do them fuck
what the fuck
we're killing ourselves over here wow
you don't have to do these man i like
them i just
when i can't touch my chest to the bar i
feel like i'm short-ranging my range of
motion
and i have an ego you know so like
yeah the full rom ego yeah my shit's not
perfect
i just leave the session kind of sad
about
myself your hair looks weird
[Music]
wait wait wait that's all i picture
grandma's coming into the basement i
gotta stop jacking off the garage
that's all y'all
charlie can you shut the fuck up jesus
[Music]
gotta bite
come on
[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
[Music]

[Music]
hmm buddy building's all about me
bodybuilding is a team sport
where's your support system bro
right
left me
truth at least half of it did
let's stop talking about jared's
absentee father and talk about pull-ups
they're fun and they train your back
which is two great things
um
my goal is just to clear my chin over
the bar that's how i count good reps
controlled real deep stretch at the
bottom of course
um
yeah starting out the workout here for
the back
three four sets of five to ten rep range
pull-ups charlie's doing a bit of
assisted cause just because he can take
a slightly different grip on that
straight bar bothers his elbows
yeah and jared's doing some really funky
stuff with the technique so watch
this
god damn jared
[Music]
great great great
[Music]
you guys know what pride is
you know what pride is
when your son grows up to be even more
muscular than you my seed
my baby boy
[Music]
there you go
yeah fuck yeah
[Music]
uh
oh
2 45 this morning
pull ups are tough
but
they work
ouch all right pull downs time folks
about three or four sets here
10 to 20 rep range and a lot of
questions last time i posted this
similar workout to insta
or like dr mike why are you doing two of
the same movements
well you think of it as very similar
movements
and that's fine although pulldowns are
pretty distinct
from pull-ups
even if it's the same movement it's just
a concept of essentially downsets you
know like i just did six reps on my last
set of pull-ups
i need more volume and i get a really
good sfr
in my back
for higher reps so now it's pull down
snap to 20. if i could do pull ups in 10
to 20 range first one back would be 10
times bigger and also than i would then
i would and then i would
hold ons
[Music]
[Applause]
i'll show you guys what a real pulldown
looks like
[Music]
do it work set
[Music]
