four
score and hypertrophy concepts and tools
27
years ago yes yes
i decided since it's quarantined times
to grow on my facial hair
then i decided that i hate the way my
mustache feels
and i did the abraham lincoln amish guy
thing and i decided wolverine looks a
little cooler
so so maybe uh do i look like wolverine
ah
does he do that anyway you guys let me
know how ridiculous i sound
but on things that are a little less
ridiculous hypertrophy concepts tools
number 27
super super super important one that i'm
sure will get lots of views
measuring your progress because we know
we're in the gym to progress in our
muscle size
some of us there have to be ways to
measure
if and how much progress or worse
none we're actually getting and the good
news
is that we can do it through a couple of
different ways
that are complementary that have taken
together paint a really good picture
and then we don't have to be in the dark
about how fast we're making gains
if we're making gains and so on and so
forth now real quick
why are we interested in measuring
progress well it's critical to a couple
of things
first of all program design how do you
know which programs you've built
work better and which ones work worse if
you don't ever measure progress you
won't know
you'll just be like ah i think this
program looks fine you could be a total
guess
second is auto regulation auto
regulation often involves
adjusting volumes and loads and various
other parameters based on your responses
if you don't really know your responses
then how are you supposed to auto
regulate
are you getting stronger is a good
question well how do you know if you're
not measuring it
right next one is program change
people say oh man i've hit a plateau i
need to change my program
very reasonable but how if you're not
measuring progress
appropriately do you even know you have
you've hit a plateau i've personally
interacted with people
for example that have said oh man i'm
not gaining any weight
and i you know i'm eating all these
calories and i've sort of
gotten back to them and said well you
know try this try this or that and then
i got wise cause
all that stuff didn't pan out and now i
ask people another thing when they say
look i can't gain weight
i asked them a really crazy question
well how much weight have you gained in
the past several months
a lot of times they'd be like well like
five pounds i'm like that's really good
that's a really good pace
so what they meant when they said they
weren't gaining weight was they weren't
gaining as much weight as they had liked
which is actually too much weight too
fast
so you have to be able to quantify
progress in order to actually have a
real world approach
to see okay has my program working or
doesn't need to change
another thing about program change is a
lot of people will switch a program
basically just for anxiety reasons you
know like the analysis paralysis sort of
situation
they got crap like i could be getting
better gains and they switch the program
if they look back at their whole program
and apply some of the principles or
practices
we're going to be using here they would
actually realize that their old program
was getting great gains
and if we know that then why the hell
would ever switch
right and then lastly hugely in coaching
others
so with yourself you might have sort of
an intuitive feel just based on how
strong you are sort of how jack you look
which we'll get to as some of our actual
formal methods of
ascertaining gains but if you're
coaching someone else
you may only communicate through
pictures and videos on occasion
you're not there in real life watching
them and uh
it becomes really really really
important to be able to somehow quantify
their progress
for two reasons the big reason is to
make sure they're getting it and alter
variables to make sure they're getting
it
and two uh is to some extent to show the
person that they're actually making
progress
because sometimes people don't know that
they're making progress and muscle adds
slowly so it's hard to tell if you're
getting more jacked
people get discouraged and if you can
show them some things which we'll show
you in a bit
like repetition strength for example
show them that they have been getting
stronger for reps
that really tends to re-light the fire
and keep folks going
on the right track so good news
is this a rather simple lecture there
are only four
best best best ways in which to measure
muscle growth progress
over the short medium and long term
and just by using these four you won't
really need to do anything else
for a pretty convincing case for the
fact that all the other stuff that you
could try to ascertain
is so erroneous as to not be worth your
time so let's get right into it
the first indicator of progress
in terms of muscle growth by the way is
all muscle growth here
is actually what we would call a leading
indicator
it occurs before the progress actually
does
in this case it's raw stimulus magnitude
and stimulus to fatigue ratio
these things when they are high predict
progress
because they correlate to what is
causing progress robust hypertrophy
stimulus
okay that's like looking at indices of
how full you are
and looking at a picture of a meal in
reference to a normal size something
a cell phone right you look at this
picture of a meal that you're about to
eat
could you say that that picture tells
you nothing about how
full you're gonna be well of course it
tells you something if it's a whole
plate of food that looks like five times
the size of your giant cell phone
you're probably going to get full but if
it's this tiny little piece of food
you're probably not
even though you have yet to eat anything
these are pictures are leading
indicators for how full you're going to
be in adjust the same way
if you're doing a good job in the gym
that doesn't mean right then and they're
in the gym you grow muscle but it sure
as hell sets you up
what are these things well we've been
through them a ton and i perfect
concepts of jewels so just a quick
review but you guys already know these
if your session of training your
previous sessions for the previous day
weeks months anything have had the
target muscle experiencing
lots of tension that is a good thing
burn in the higher reps that is a good
thing
pumps from training that's a very good
thing and a feeling and sensation and
perception and measurement by strength
of disruption is a very very good thing
if these things are happening and you're
getting a lot of them
then you're probably on your way to
gains as
long as two other things are occurring
one
your fatigue is in check which is why
it's not just raw stimulus magnitude but
stimulus to fatigue ratio
if your joints feel good during this
time and if your systemic fatigue isn't
super crazy high and you're getting back
to back to back
awesome awesome high raw stimulus
magnitude sessions
you're halfway there okay all right
two-thirds of the way there you got the
high-row stimulus a good stimulus to
fatigue ratio that's one and two
and three is your nutrition and recovery
strategies are fundamentally in line
because it doesn't matter how good your
workouts are if you don't eat food and
enough protein
you won't grow muscle nearly as much as
you could or at all
and if you're not getting rest and sleep
and relaxation you also won't grow
muscle or nearly as much
as you can but if your food is
fundamentally good if your rest is
fundamentally good
you're getting good workouts you're
probably on your way
to some decent gains at least the best
kinds of gains
you could be getting now here's the
thing
this is nowhere near the sole predictor
of gains it's not actually even a
measurement of gains it's just a
predictor
predictions are all flawed and this
isn't a perfect one
but a couple of good things are going
for it
it is a leading indicator which means
you don't actually have to wait
to change and correct course whether it
be through your program or
diet or anything like that for example
if your program is sound and you're not
getting pumps in the gym
and you're eating very few carbs you
increase your carbs
right then and there and then your
workouts get awesome you start getting
huge pumps that probably means
you started to create more muscle gain
without having to spend months looking
back
measuring it be like crap i guess i was
for months under eating carbs
right you can course correct right away
because these indices are apparent
within
every single work right awesome awesome
to have this this is a unique tool on
our arsenal that does not require you
to wait it's a right away predictor of
which way you're going so it can
definitely shoot you
to to the right place secondly
if you're checking these boxes of high
rust stimulus magnitude at a good
stimulus to fatigue ratio
with good food and recovery and all that
it is not a guarantee that you're going
to be growing well because you could
just be reaching your genetic ceiling
and even though everything's going great
the amount of fractional protein
turnover is just not very high
right however if you are not
checking these boxes or much at all if
you really don't feel tension in the
target muscle
not a burn on the target muscle with
higher reps very very disappointing
pumps are no pumps at all and no
evidence of muscle disruption then you
have a serious cause for concern
so this can almost be like a contra
positive finding
where if you don't have a raw stimulus
magnitude and a high degree of stimulus
to fatigue ratio
then you should be doing something about
it to get one because measuring months
later and be like oh i guess i didn't
grow any muscle i should have known
because
my workouts were crappy right so this is
a super super important tool
so when people you know do their
training and they sort of ask you as a
coach or trainer like hey am i growing
muscle
you could just be like hey how does your
attention burn pumps disruption and
they'd be like dude everything's
wild right maybe the only thing you have
to worry about is that they're doing too
much
right and how do we know we're not doing
too much is our next indicator and that
is repetition strength
so rep strength means two things
potentially or a combination of both one
you're doing more reps at the same
weight
than you were any other time before
we'll talk more specifically about how
to best compare
or two you are using the same
repetitions but doing more weight
or both if you're a real baller right so
basically like you used to bench 225 for
10
now you're benching 235 for 10 or 240
for 10. or you used to bench 225 for 10
now you're benching 225 for 12 or 13 or
you used to bench 225 for 10
now you're benching 235 for 12.
something is going up
and that's probably a good thing how do
we know
rep strength is correlated to muscle
gains because if your training is really
similar
after a while neural factors really
don't play a huge role
the only way to get stronger is adding
size also
neural factors probably affect how many
reps you can do but they probably affect
your one rep max a little bit more so
when you're adding reps
or adding weight and reps it's probably
a lot to do with just sheer muscle size
another factor is that the biggest
people in the world are
often the strongest four reps maybe not
for singles but definitely for reps
you show me someone that's benching 405
for 20 reps squatting 600 for 10 reps
and deadlifting 700 for 10 reps and
rowing 315 with strict technique for
sets of 15
they are going to be fucking enormous
and there's no way around it
there's no technique around it if you're
doing heavy reps
you're gonna be jacked so the more heavy
reps you can do
or the more weight you can do with the
same number of reps the better and the
very likely
that your muscle gain is occurring but
there are ways that the nervous system
and some structural remodeling of muscle
sort of which way it points
can sort of poison the analysis so we've
got to take some some due diligence to
make sure we're doing this right
comparing the right things the right
ways to try to factor out the nervous
system
and architectural changes and really get
to our
strength correlations actually predict
muscle growth best
so a couple ways to do this one is we
want to reserve comparisons for the same
ranges
not between them so for example he said
you know i squatted
405 for five back in the day and then
recently i did 315 for 12. which one of
those is more impressive it's
really impossible to compare because
there's a specificity to doing reps you
could just get good at one and worse at
the other
you really want to compare in the same
rep range what did i do for sets
of five to ten in some exercise versus
what i did
that's a five to ten later that
comparison is going to be much tighter
than separating out the ranges because
there just can be some specificity there
and also even if there isn't even if
there's absolute gains indicated
it's really hard to tell how many reps
you know how much weight at
25 reps is more impressive than how much
weight at sets of seven reps right it
really really difficult to ascertain
that
secondly fatigue can mask improvements
within a mesocycle
right people think okay i'm gaining
strength week to week to week that means
maybe that you're just not adding enough
volume
right and if you're adding enough volume
you won't be gaining a ton of strength
but you'll actually be stimulating a ton
of hypertrophy increase
so it's very difficult to see in a
muscle cycle what's going on so you
measure
meso to meso which means let's say you
squatted
from 400 to 415 you got 415 for a set of
eight
the next message cycle maybe you go from
405 to 420
and then in that third microcycle you
hit up
415 and maybe you do it for nine or ten
that's a good comparison
because we're comparing not only
mesocycle to mesocycle but we're
comparing the end of a metal cycle in
both cases or even better
420 you did let's say for nine reps and
then
that was in the peak week the last week
before deload
and in the as a cycle before you did 415
for eight
i mean 420 for nine is better than 415
freight that's a very good sign
that good things are happening right so
we not only measure meso to meso but
usually the same point in every member
cycle
and because you try your hardest close
to fail
in the peak week of every measle that's
a really really good time to compare so
basically at the end of every mesocycle
accumulation phase
you write down all your reps you should
be writing them down anyway write down
all your weights
next meso you write them down and you
compare and it should be progress
right and how much progress you know
sometimes a lot sometimes
a little bit the same exercises have to
be used okay
if someone told me like hey look i like
pressed four or five for ten
a couple months ago and this this this
time i squatted a hack squad at 405 for
eight
did i get stronger hell am i supposed to
know different people convert
different machines convert differently
from exercise to exercise so much
neural neural and technical learning
involved who the hell knows
it's got to be the same exercises too
and they should be
contiguous that means you should be
training them for a while so for example
if you've been training squats
continuously for two mesocycles
now you're getting some good data as to
how how strong you really are because of
your muscle growth
not because of neural adaptations so
mesos like
two and three and four you can really
compare
and see maybe how much muscle you've
gained whereas meso1 of squatting if you
haven't done it in a while
that's going to be a lot of neural gains
it's going to look artificially much
weaker than your muscle size
actually indicates another way to
compare is to compare exercises that you
haven't done in a long time so let's say
six months ago is the last time you done
uh barbell bent over rows
with the 45s touching the grounds now
that you're doing them again
if one mesocycle later you're hitting
all-time prs again
that's a real good sign that you have a
bigger back because there's some neural
relearning that has to occur but about a
mesocycle later most of that's happened
and if you're getting huge prs holy crap
that's a really good sign
a bad sign would be if you hit massive
prs in the bent row
six months ago and it takes you four
months again to even start scratching
the surface to almost hit your new pr's
can you really say you grew back muscle
in the interim oh man probably not
which what the hell is that muscle doing
not helping you bent row more weight
right it has to be i mean this goes
without saying at this point just got to
say it to make sure it's out there
must be good technique because if you
start cheating your technique
you don't really know what you're
comparing anymore because it could just
be partial reps versus full reps
and yes you should want to push for prs
only with good technique so it's not so
much that you're pushing for pr's
especially in the last week
you're just doing your best with good
technique and you let the prs happen
i'll put it to you this way if you do
leg presses
your best was four or five for a set of
ten
months later your leg pressing 405
if by 10 you reach essentially technical
failure but you grind two more
dog shit reps out by cutting your depth
or worse
you know that you're not going to hit 10
by about rep 8 with strict technique
and reps 9 10 11 12 are awful
you're essentially cheating gee you
you can write down and say hey to rep pr
who the fuck are you lying to your
entire analysis
is supposed to tell you if you're
growing muscle or not and because you
would have hit 10 reps one way or
another
basically it's telling you probably
haven't do you really want to conclude
that you have when you really haven't do
you really want to think your program is
good when it's really not do you really
want to think you did a good job losing
fat and not muscle when you clearly
maybe lost some muscle or certainly
didn't gain any
no always check technique and don't
really worry about the number so much
as much as just do your best and when
you look back at your old numbers you'll
be like oh my god i got 205 for five
i just did it for eight that's the way
you know you gain muscle the process of
discovering that you became stronger
just by using your body not inching your
way
and cheating here and there a little
body english
a longer rest before a next set just to
hit a pr
that is literally cheating yourself of
the knowledge of did you grow muscle
and how much right here's the deal
using the sort of contrapositive
approach
if after three to six months of a muscle
gain phase for example
if you're not getting stronger on a
bunch of lifts for reps
something is amiss something is wrong
sometimes people will say with all the
best intentions and this is sort of
misapplied in many cases
they'd be like don't worry about how
strong you're getting it's all about
quality contractions good technique and
all this other stuff they have a point
not to over value strength and pursue it
at the detriment of all these other
things but if all those other things
occurring
and you gaining muscle should be getting
stronger and if
your honest analysis is that you're not
getting stronger
something is not good and you need to
realize the plan reanalyze your
application so on and so forth
next this is a funny one because it's so
straightforward
body weight and appearance this is not
rocket science
here's what you do you note how you look
in the mirror you guys look in the
mirror a ton anyway
should be experts at this certain veins
do you have them
look at some body fat this one shoulder
vein just comes in and you think you're
super lean but it's not there and you
know that it's supposed to be there
because last time you took pictures a
year ago it was
shit i'm not as lean as i think i am and
i'm at a certain weight that means i
didn't gain as much muscle as i thought
i did
okay so there you go certain veins
number of abs
right if you normally at 220 pounds
have a four pack and then you've lost a
bunch of fat and you've done a great
muscle gain phase and now you're 220
pounds
and you have a six pack gee that's
really good that probably means you gain
muscle there's really not any way around
that
clarity of lines how deeply etched are
your abs how much can you see your bicep
separating from your tricep from the
side things like that
you're real expert at looking at your
body because you do it all the time i
sure
look at my body all the time right if
you get to know how your body looks and
you're honest with yourself
progress pictures can help as well you
sort of know where you stand
and you know based on body weight
where you stand relatively to how much
muscle you have probably and how much
fat for example
if months later you're much leaner than
you were looking
but you're not much lighter that's a
really good sign that probably means you
lost a lot of fat
but not a lot of muscle and you might
have gained some muscle
if months later after your first sort of
visual assessment and these are always
continuous of course
if months later you're heavier but just
not much fatter
that's a really good sign a lot of pro
bodybuilders will post pictures in the
off season
and they'll say you know this is the
leanest i've ever been at this weight
they don't mean that they're proud of
their leanest
because or their leanness because like
they look like shit compared to when
they were on stage this is a fat dude
right
way off season shape but because it's
the leanest they have ever been at 300
pounds or whatever
they know that they're carrying more
muscle than usual once they cut it down
they'll probably instead of weighing 240
on stage
way to 48 on stage that's way more
muscle
great great tool for keeping track of
that if you return
back to an old weight you've been down
to before but you're way leaner than
before
that's great for example in my
own case actually right now when
i i did my last year's fat loss cycle i
got to a certain standard
level of leanness that i remember well
based on exactly sort of how my lines
looked and all the details and etching
of what bullshit details i do have and i
was 215 pounds at the time
right now as i record this video i'm
around 230 pounds
and on some days i'm getting awfully
close to looking like what i did at 215.
now does that mean again 15 pounds of
muscle
hell no there's some other extinguishing
circumstances some body waters involved
but once my body water looks similar
and once my leanness looks exactly like
it did i'll probably weigh something
like 220 to 225
man that's way better than 215 something
has to give that's not just
magic or random that's probably some
muscle gain at least some pounds of that
again here the contrapositive the
opposite i sure hope i'm using that word
correctly
the opposite is real bad news right
if you had some pictures of yourself
when you weighed 2 15 last time and
you're looking like
something and you're now 212 past 215
and you still don't look that sharp oh
boy not good
do not pat yourself in the back for
having gained muscle right
here are ways to make sure you're doing
this properly the mirror and the scale
combo
first of all you only compare the same
phase with the same phase
fat loss to fat loss and the same timing
within these phase
four weeks into fat loss four weeks into
fat loss eight weeks into fat loss eight
weeks into fat loss
muscle gain week one muscle gain week
one from six months ago
why if you're in a fat loss phase after
eight weeks you've burned a certain
amount of glycogen that means you're
going to be relatively flat
that means your scale weight's going to
be low for how not great you look
if you took one week after that and
transition to a mass gain phase
you're going to look a like a god
because you're going to be one week into
massing you're still essentially almost
exactly as lean as you were if not
exactly as lean
and your glycogen is full to the brim so
all of a sudden instead of weighing
on 195 looking flat and sort of stringy
you're weighing 202 pounds and you look
even better
and you think if you compare first week
of mass this time
to the last week of your cut last time
you're gonna be like oh my god dude like
i gained like 18 pounds of muscle
bullshit but if you compare the first
week of massing in the first week of
mass and the glycogen is similar
the dryness is similar to the roundness
similar and the scale weight is very
comparable
not to say it's the same but at that
point any differences
may be differences in muscle and fat you
can get that much better of a perception
also from those of you folks that are
involved in hypertrophy training at a
pretty advanced level know
after several weeks of cutting your
glycogen may be so low you're down just
five pounds in glycogen alone
and if you think you lost five pounds of
muscle because that's what it looks like
visually you're super wrong because
after one week of eating lots of carbs
you're like oh my god i gained five
pounds of muscle it doesn't work like
that
here's the deal again the sort of the
counter positive here
if you have to really ponder if you look
like you've made gains or not
or if the scale has moved relative to
your body fat you probably have not made
significant gains
right if you have to squint instead of
like in this lighting i got and you know
you're aligning yourself at least with
experience
i'll have times when i'm at the gym or
nowadays during
recorded during quarantine at home well
i'll like like flex in the mirror into
the camera of the cell phone
and i'll look at it and within like two
seconds or just the mirror i just do
this i'm like
today's not the day right uh nothing
nothing to look at
because for example i'll be at the end
of a cutting cycle and i'm just trying
to see do
i see any new detail i've never seen
before it's usually pretty open and shut
if you weigh 220 pounds
at the beginning of a mass phase and the
last time you started your mass at 210
and you get a huge chest pump and you
flex in the mirror at the gym and
there's just bullshit just all over that
you've never seen before
don't you worry you're making games but
if you flex and you're like ah
and someone's like is this the best
you've ever looked and you're like
not good or at least something to think
about and not get too excited about
having gained a bunch
right lastly
and least least important least powerful
is body composition measurement i know
that's crazy right
this rp is supposed to be out science
and everything and we take actual
scientific body composition measurement
and put it last
why fundamentally it is because these
things have too much error
to conclude about intra-individual
change change between you
earlier and you now they just have too
much error even the best ones
a couple of things you can use however
and here's how to use them you can do
personal one or two site skin folds on
yourself
so you essentially skin fold yourself in
the exact same spot maybe right next
to your belly button you pinch properly
you put the skinfold calipers on your
skin
and then you measure how many
millimeters it has and that measurement
is only a robot reliability estimate
that measurement does not tell you how
fat you are
it just says 11 millimeters and as you
are massing
maybe a last mass cycle you also did
that your last muscle gain phase you
measured
and you noticed that you got like
towards the end of being able to see
your abs slash
sloppy fat when you cut off your mass
phase
you were uh 170 pounds and it was a
16 measurement on your caliper right 16
millimeters which doesn't have to mean
anything what percent body fat is that
who the fuck knows i don't know
one site sure as hell doesn't tell you
that but you have that measurement and
you've taken
measurements twice a week okay for a
long time and you ended your last mass
you were a little bit sloppy at 16 right
this mass phase so this muscle gain
phase you've come up come up come up
and you weigh 170 again just like you
did last time
except now you're calipering 12. what
does that mean
that means because you have less fat on
your stomach almost certainly you have
less fat everywhere else
and because you have four more
millimeters of fat to fill in but you're
already at your old body weight
that for sure means you're more muscular
now and good news you have more muscle
to gain
so now you have two really great options
you can stop muscle gain phase now
super fucking lean and then get even
leaner and then potentiate more muscle
mass later
and even leaner very easily because
you're not even up to 16 like you were
last time
or you can keep going to anywhere
between 12 13 14 15 or 16 millimeters
which could take you another
three months and then by the time you're
at 16 again which means
probably you're roughly at the same body
fat percentage as you were
now you might weigh like 177. oh my god
that's awesome you gained like five
pounds of muscle
from that point on but again the
contrapositive here
is if you weigh 168
and you're clipping a 16 and you used to
weigh 170 at the same time the same
cycle back then
and you're clipping a 16 not a good sign
not a good sign
right so these things can be done
but remember it's just reliability it's
not accuracy so you have no idea what
body fat you are
but you know what the skin folds are now
an interesting way to do this
is getting a dexa which we'll talk about
next
at the end of a fat loss phase for
example and or at the top end of a
muscle gain phase
and that same day that you get a dexa
you do the skin fold of your own
abdominal region once you do that skin
fold
you realize that okay this dexa says i'm
roughly
seven percent fat and the skin fold is
like a five
and then it says i'm roughly you know on
a mass gain phase
it says i'm 14 fat and the skin fold is
a 20.
you can interpolate those numbers right
you know
when you go so seven percent to 14 and
you scale that in
with you know skin fold is five skin
fold is 20
you get basically a conversion chart
it's really easy to do
for like roughly what skin fold is
roughly very roughly what body fat
percent because you
ain't gonna get a dexa every week
you actually can get a dexa once a week
and be just at
the federally mandated maximum exposure
of radiation limits
i don't know if you want to throw away
100 a week to basically go to the
dentist once a week
radiation-wise so this gives you the
ability to sort of replicate a dexa kind
of all the time
really really cool neat trick if you
want to try it and it only takes
essentially two decks
and then it works for years later now at
some point your body's going to change
muscles grow
fat stretches so on and so forth skin
stretches you might want to redo this
process
every couple of years but this is a
really really good start
so great great tool what about videxa
okay the dexa is really really good but
anything shy of about
6 to 12 months of time for comparison is
too frequent
and error can just eat up all of the
changes okay
so you're looking at changes and all you
see is actually error even though you
don't know that
like you were 13 body fat last time this
time it says 11
turns out you could have actually been
10 last time and this time you could
have actually been 12
you have no idea right because the range
of error is like one to three percent
okay great for measuring big populations
and seeing if creatine works in one
group
versus another because they average and
cancel themselves out but for individual
to individual to individual
you and you and you it's very very
difficult to tell what kind of muscle
gains or fat losses have actually
occurred
it's bad to get a dexa and be unsure of
what's going on
it's worse to get a dexa and be
convinced that it's an incredibly
precise and accurate instrument
and to make program changes on it that
are unwarranted for example
let's say you had a new way of dieting
that you tried you build a little bit
more fasting a little bit more
high-intensity cardio
and you were super busy with stuff so
you didn't sleep as much
and you get a dexa before that fat loss
phase and after three months
so the potential for how much change
there is isn't a lot the potential error
measurement is very very high
you did that and also you made another
cardinal mistake you did a dexa last
time at the end of a muscle gain phase
and this time you did at the beginning
of a fat loss phase or
the other way around what you end up
doing is detecting
potentially one of three things
thing one as sweet as just accuracy and
precision so you actually got a really
good result and you can use it to say
wow
this is exactly what happened and this
phase worked relatively well everything
i did here seemed to
i didn't lose any muscle i didn't gain
any but i lost a lot of fat great okay
thing two is it can make it seem
that you lost a crapload of muscle and
gained a ton of fat or just didn't lose
any fat like i've seen dexes of people
that clearly got leaner and it said they
just lost all muscle just measuring air
that is really can be devastating
because it super pisses you off like oh
my god like i tried my best and it
wasn't like
amazing i and do everything right but
for the love of god i just really lose
seven pounds of muscle almost certainly
not
but there's the worst thing which is
when you do something
like i just described your training is
your diet is a little bit not enough
food spread throughout the day
your cardio is a little bit too intense
and you weren't getting enough sleep
and the dexa come back and due to error
it says you lost eight pounds of fat
and gained two pounds of muscle what are
you gonna think if you don't know any
better and i've been that person to not
know any better for years
you're gonna be like oh my god i
have discovered the holy grail of fat
loss while gaining muscle
and if someone tells you hey man sleep
is really important you probably
shouldn't miss it you're like whatever
i lost a ton of fat and gain muscle the
same time not even sleeping enough and
this new cardio it's so fun it's hard
high intensity it's hardcore
i don't have to eat all the time either
i can just eat two meals a day and i'm
golden
we're in reality what you did was you
actually lost muscle
and lost a little bit of fat but lost a
lot of muscle but the dexa didn't pick
that up because it's
measurement error is small but
significant on those
essentially on those windows of
comparisons that we want individual to
individual to individual
so that idea that you did great but you
really didn't
good god because then you're going to
apply that same phase at least
if the dexa lies to you and says you
suck you have some impetus to improve
a maybe already good plan but if you
think your shitty plan is great because
the dachshund told you so you could have
another year of dog shit results and
then here's what happens you get another
dex and this time it flips the switch on
you
and shows you the reality and you're
like oh my god i lost six pounds of
muscle last year
and i didn't lose any fat what the what
the hell
but but my oh what about my old dexa and
then all of a sudden you're thinking oh
well this dex is wrong that what i got
before is right
don't get yourself down that road these
things have huge huge limitations
using them to establish the skinfold
thing is a good thing to do
maybe getting them once every two years
or so is a good thing just for baseline
values
otherwise you're putting way too much
stock into a device that was not
designed to do what you wanted to do
which is track individual changes in
body composition
over weeks or even over months it's
designed to compare various individuals
body composition by the way it's really
actually designed to compare bone
densities
so along with this you may be thinking
okay if
dexa which is awesome has
such a poor applicability to our
hypertrophy journey of judging if we're
progressing or not
how does bioelectrical impedance
analysis the thing where you hold the
handles how does that
weigh in what about bod pod what about
skin folds all that stuff
really just has even bigger errors does
not tell you and by skin folds i don't
mean just the one site reliability
comparison
i mean like a three side or seven site
formula one which tells you a body fat
percentage you go ah this is what it is
right those can be done actually if you
have someone experience doing them for
you
again for reliability they can be in a
week to week to week and show you
tracking and progress those are great
but unfortunately if you use them just
once every three or four months and say
hi gain five pounds of muscle
not a good idea not a good idea at all
right
those things biological impedance
analysis bod pod
skin folds etc they don't tell you
anything
that the scale mirror and rep strength
don't already tell you
so my biggest advice and to close out
this discussion is
make sure you're keeping super on tabs
with
raw stimulus magnitude stimulus to
fatigue ratio have
great workouts number one number two
get your nutrition and sleep and
everything relaxation wise
in line to guarantee or enhance the
probability
that those great workouts are going to
be causing muscle growth
next make sure you're keeping track of
your repetition strength and make sure
you're looking at the scale in the
mirror and paying close attention
you can also do the skin fold caliper
thing just on yourself on your
close to belly button region properly
week and week out and have good
data you can do an even better job by
referencing that to an
every couple of years dexa but
after that any more investigation skin
folds and bod pod and tons of dexas
do you no good and they're going to
steer you wrong folks
thank you so much for tuning in we'll
see you for the next lecture
