oh it's good to be back again weekly
webinar dr james dr mike mike how's it
going
james you know what i've been better but
very not much better so
actually quite well that's good i'm
having just one of those
just a couple bad weeks for those of you
who i talked to mike about this he
already knows but for those of you don't
know i was
mike and i did a zoom chat yesterday we
were doing some work
and we had to settle some stuff on the
uh hypertrophy book and we're
all it seems like everybody's really
happy with where everything's at and
that's awesome
so i hang up with mike and literally it
sounds like a fucking
chandelier just like dumps in my house
and i don't own any chandeliers so i go
into the back
just glass everywhere just glass all
over the house it's just like
unbelievable amount of glass and mel and
i are just like what the fuck
happened and as we're looking around we
can see there's like a cannonball sized
hole
through one of the windows and it's like
a big room it's like you know probably
30-40 feet long
and there's this huge hole so this all
this glass had been blown in and there
was a
dead grouse which is like a really big
bird that people can eat
so this motherfucker kamikazed through
and launched
two panes of glass like 30 feet into the
room so i've just been dealing with this
gaping cannonball
hole in my house thanks to this bird mel
like a like a typical meldovian tore its
wings off and took the breast meat she's
gonna eat it
it's pretty sharp you know i think this
grouse is part of an
anti uh hypertrophy book
dare i say because right they're like no
he's doing too much he's healthy he's
doing that getting too close
no kidding i'm telling you it's one
thing after a fuck another but
at least hypertrophy book is coming
along well yeah
yeah all right shall we go to our first
question ask her
yes let's do it which is actually
hilariously uh henrik anderson
is maybe from sweden and there's a cool
swedish name
that is just ask her like ask her you
can droop
oh yeah uh which is funny if you also
ask a lot of questions people
think you're trolling that's good henrik
anderson
asks do muscles grow x amount after
every workout or does muscle size
increase over time when progressive or
alone is presented
if you go on a vacation go to the local
gym once with no program and
fucking obliterate your quads not
exceeding your max precision volume will
they grow at all yeah they absolutely
will
so muscles grow through at least two
mechanisms one is the direct
increase in fractional synthetic rate
the amount of uh added protein
over the several hours and days after
which you train them
and then the second way in which they
grow is probably a more complex
restructuring and updating of sarcomeres
and all the more complex structures in
the muscle
um so you if you just do random workouts
every now and again
there are two problems with that one is
you don't get that sort of deeper
ultra structural growth happening as
predictably and that's not as
efficiently
and two if you don't train frequently
enough you grow muscle
and then over several days and weeks you
lose that muscle and then if you hit it
again randomly you regrow it and then
just not one step forward one step back
sort of thing but yes
muscles do grow x amount after every
workout and there's probably a deeper
growth mechanism that relies on multiple
workouts to direct deeper adaptations
um getting both is ideal so you want to
work out
at least twice a week for the same
muscles and progressively use
similar exercises rep ranges and loading
patterns and
increase slowly over time to and not
skip a ton of sessions to get that
deeper
overload based growth james yeah that
was really good i don't have anything
else
okie dokie next up is i believe
make sure michael chee
all right looks like we're on we're on
track today all right
yeah later i get off track because we
ran out of the algorithm fucked us
anyway but we'll be on track for a bit
michael chi says hi docs what are the
pros and cons of
running i thought this was going to be a
gear question this when i read up
shorter versus longer mesocycles with
typical cycle progression increasing
from three rir to failure
so and this is something that our book
the hypertrophy book will uh explain
very well and it's coming out
very soon i can actually confidently say
that now um
and uh actually by the time this post
the book may very well be out
true yeah so um
the thing about mesocycle
progression is outside of special cases
the length of progression is determined
almost entirely by autoregulatory
mechanisms
specifically how much fitness do you
gain micro to micro uh
and underlying fitness you gain over
multiple micros
versus how quickly do you accumulate
fatigue so there are some boundaries we
have to set up
the best sorts of mesocycles start at
roughly minimum effective volume and
roughly at three rir or so three or four
reps in reserve
and then how quickly you go
and jump to the next one to the next the
next one how
fast fatigue adds up or is cancelled out
by fitness adding up a little faster
determines how many micros you can
string in a row
to actually sort of buy yourself some
time uh
and how long that mesocycle actually
ends up
so in every single micro cycle you're
faced with very similar constraints
here they are the rule on rir
is that you have to train at least as
hard as last time rar wise
if not a little harder and that's one of
those rules that does offer a bit of a
sort of fork in the road where if you
really try to go
three rar the next week two then one
then zero
that's a way to get the micro cycles to
accumulate
more fitness and fatigue more rapidly
and it will cut your meso
accumulation length the other
alternative is to maybe do
as many as two sessions where it's the
same so you could do three rar then next
week three rer the next week two rar
then next week two rer
we wouldn't james and i recommend you go
any more than
two sessions at the same ir because then
you're just doing that shit where you're
guessing you're not really sure
you're not ensuring overload so you can
make a message cycle roughly one and a
half to twice
as long by milking out the rirs uh
two weeks in a row versus one but we
wouldn't recommend three so there's like
already we're constrained but there's
some wiggle room but here's the thing
you think okay but what about adding
volume like i can choose to add volume
quickly or slowly you actually can't and
here's why
you add volume only via auto regulation
in the grand sense of trying to do the
best job you can which is to say
if you're getting pumps if you're
getting a ton of disruption in the
muscle you're getting a ton of tension
where you're supposed to be
don't do anything your volume is great
if that starts to be not so much a thing
you should raise your volume you don't
want to be like well i'm trying to like
have a longer accumulation and someone's
like okay so are you getting pumps
and you're like no but i don't want to
add volume because then i'll fatigue
faster
so what the fuck are you doing then like
you're literally having shitty possibly
non-hypertrophic strength workouts
in a certain rep range and you're just
getting better at lifting those weights
through the nervous system and other
pathways because your volume is
insufficient to cause maximum and maybe
any hypertrophy at all
and on the other hand if you're getting
rate pumps great disruption
if you choose to make your mesocycle
needlessly faster your accumulation
phase shorter
you're going to be adding volume when
it's already close to mav levels and
you're going to be doing tons of damage
and you're going to have to take delo
little mini recovery breaks that's going
to extend your motorcycle anyway or you
just functionally overreach
and then non-function the overage for no
reason so if you're like dude
monday and my chest got a little sore
got a fucking gnarly pump
that was six sets be like what are you
gonna do next monday like fucking 12
like what the fuck why like don't touch
it it's not broken as a matter of fact
it's right on and until it unless
you don't get good pumps and soreness
don't fucking do anything don't raise
the volume don't pointlessly
like james and i got painted into a
corner with us the mrv guys like you've
got to raise your volume
you got to raise your volume because we
say after a few weeks what you started
with isn't enough
if it's still somehow enough don't
fucking raise your volume you
only as much volume as you need to grow
no more no less
so as you can see with that auto
regulation approach you really don't
have a ton of choice
as to how quickly to add your volume
that's auto regulatory
uh essentially described for you already
you just have to make the right choices
so yes you can lean into one way and
lean into the other
but really mesocycle length is pretty
constrained just by doing a good job at
every single micro cycle hitting the
right rirs and adjusting volume the
proper way
your body kind of tells you the rest so
and james and i
i've seen tons of lifters get into this
thing where they're like man i'm trying
to do six to one paradigms six
accumulation micros and one d load
i can't do it anymore they're like
what's so good about six like well
more is better right like who the fuck
told you that and sort of answer your
real question
um as far as the research is concerned
and as far as deep theory is concerned
we have no reason to believe that
anything north
of four to one like five to one six to
one seven uh eight to one etc
is better somehow than at least four to
one yeah three to one paradigm you could
probably do more total training and less
total deloading
two to one for sure too little right but
anything
four to one or higher is probably
equivalent
it washes out completely to just about
the same thing so what you have to be
concerned with
is not how long your mesocycles are and
should you be hitting four five or six
to one
you should be concerned about making
quality auto regulated decisions at
every single micro cycle so that when
the accumulation phase does end
you're like okay i did it right every
single time and now i'm deloading
exactly the time i'm supposed to be you
don't want to do this shit where you're
like dude i'm really fucked up but i
gotta make it another week why
or you're like man this training is easy
as fuck but i to do a 12-1 accumulation
like
why there's no good reason for that
james yeah really good answer there dr
mike um and one thing just to kind of
keep in mind is that
you're not necessarily trying to aspire
to any particular paradigm either right
you're not supposed to be like a
four to one or a five to one guy like
that you will generally kind of
have proclivities like most people will
kind of fall into one that just tends to
work really well for them
like i would say most of the time i
typically do four to ones
but here's a really simple example and i
know mike's gonna probably roll his eyes
and laugh at me
but like when i start a new block
generally that first meso
i'll finish my peak week and i'll go
back and look at my numbers and i was
like
yeah pr pr pr
pr i guess i should do another week i
didn't see any performance drop at all
totally and then you go but i'm a four
in one guy right like you could do a
five and one this time and then
maybe the next time you're back to four
and one because fatigue is starting to
set in a little bit more et cetera et
cetera et cetera
right so you don't have to aspire to any
one particular loadout you do it in an
auto regulatory manner
just and just just more food for thought
right you might be you might be like the
james hoffman build where
meso one is five to one mesos two and
three are four to one and then when you
switch to strength work it's three to
one because it's an entirely different
thing right now you're doing strength
training
three to one works a little bit better
in that case for me so the the point is
to not
to pitch not to pigeonhole yourself into
any one of these loadouts to do it in an
auto regulated manner and if you're
looking at your numbers
and you get to your peak week and
everything's still going up
you have a hard case to make that you
have to cut it off if you do see like
performance starting to drop
especially like maybe you had a good
first set and all the rest of them are
kind of
in the going down like yeah that makes
sense time to call it a day deload and
you're probably in a good spot
yeah i think it's worth pointing this
out
there are special circumstances and
sort of it's time to make a decision
type of circumstances
that have a variance of plus one or
minus one micro cycle
like if you have a good plan and 16 week
diet you're stepping on stage or you're
going on vacation getting photos done
and that means you're doing let's say
basically like well five to one uh micro
and then
two four to one uh sorry five to one
mezzo and then two four to one mesos
because that's 16 weeks
that's your planet it's a good plan if
you're a little
more fatigued than you should be and you
have maybe half a week or a week left
you can grind it out that's totally fine
or if you're not quite nearly as
fatigued as you should be but if you
take your dealer right now or really set
you up for a great peak and you won't
have to deal it awkwardly in the middle
of a mezzo
that's totally fine to do but remember
those
are the adjustments made around the core
principle
of doing it right and having good auto
regulation so a lot of people say well
what about in this case doesn't this
cancel out
the principal design no the principal
designs the baseline
and then sometimes you have to make
these kind of like james what do they
call in football like uh
audible audible like audible calls like
okay like i
we just gotta do this right now and it's
not perfect but it's
it's perfect for the situation but that
doesn't mean that everything
is always an audible and you can have
good dependable general principles that
take you really close all the way
because like
right now like basically the way james
said it was you know
he's not fatigued enough to really
finish
uh and deload so he extends himself one
more micro i've done that a ton
right but there's also going to be
scenarios in which you don't do that you
say you know let's shut it down early
take the deload take what we've won and
then because the next meso is more
serious the diet's more progressive like
it's harder
i want to get be on the side of fresher
and i already have a plan
that's totally cool too you just have to
remember that that
logic of basic good mess cycle design
auto regulation comes
first and then on top of it you layer
modifiers
potentially it's it's almost the same
intellectual principle as people using
exceptions as rules
like you say like hey generally when
athletes get stronger they get faster
because they'll pick an athlete that's
really weak and fast see like that's why
we said generally you dumb motherfucker
and if we didn't think that that i don't
even know how you would begin to train
people
like there's i just hate it when people
shoe principles all together
and they're like well it all depends on
the situation like yeah
does it though it doesn't all depend it
very rarely depends
when it does you got to make adjustments
but that doesn't mean that everything's
all adjustments all the time
mostly you go off of general principles
yeah and like those general principles
help set up a basic kind of flow process
right like when you make a
lame example as in strength conditioning
we make an annual plan
for our athletes and really that is just
like a bare bones outline of kind of
what should happen
but then you have contingencies that say
okay well if there's a tornado like okay
well
we go this other route because we can't
do what we originally planned on doing
etc so it's just more meant to kind of
give you a general flow and direction
and then you can branch off with
exceptions as they arise but you don't
start with the assumption of exceptions
100
tomare is up next sweet name
yep ready ready
what will give more carry over pulling
exercises and or
what is the difference between barbell
holds and dead hangs
on a pull-up bar assuming they're both
the same with the same weight
is barbell hold stretches more the traps
well dead hang stretches more the lats
yes and as i know weighted stretch
causes hypertrophy
uh responded hypertrophy also responses
oh response oh yeah okay yeah
hypertrophic responses you have perfect
dreams
also what about forms tension between
the two
so yeah this is actually a pretty pretty
easy question to answer
what will give more carryover for
pulling extra sizes
uh between barbell holds and dead hangs
well it depends on which pulling
exercises
for bent rows barbell holes because
that's the position it's more specific
for vertical pulling dead hangs on a
pull-up bar hundred percent
that's the man i think that's just about
the answer and then as
both of them cause stretch media to
hypertrophy so it's they're tied on that
um and you know on the one hand barbell
holds
probably cause more systemic fatigue
because of the axial loading but on the
other hand
uh dead hangs cause a fuck load of uh a
long head tricep
shoulder and vertical pulling
musculature fatigue like your lats don't
just relax when you're dead hanging
they're on the whole time to keep your
shoulder from popping the fuck off your
bone
so a lot of these are really like pretty
fatiguing exercises and if you want
foreign hypertrophy
i would try to isolate more and do more
dynamic movements like wrist curls
require a third of the weight of dead
hangs if not
or or barbara holds if not less and they
probably provide more hypertrophy
because it's a dynamic movement with an
isometric eccentric and concentric
component
another really good exercise is to put
your forearm on a bench
and then do wrist curls with a dumbbell
i mean that takes away all axial loading
completely
it's entirely isolatory to the forearms
so that's an even better choice so these
things i would use these exercises not
for general form hypertrophy i would use
them for sport specific requirement
of better static grip strength in that
position and that
like unless you're a strong man or a
power lift or something that's probably
not something you do in
general strength or hypertrophy training
james well that's that's where uh
it was a good segue because i was going
to say um in terms of having more
carryover for pulling exercises i
wouldn't do either of these things
frankly unless you were like a strong
man
and even then strong men don't do dead
hangs it's just too big and heavy
it'd be funny to see um i would say like
the the ones that are going to have the
best carryover are just lighter versions
and variations of the movements that you
want to get good at
right so if you want to get a stronger
bent row like you can do some like cable
rows or some dumbbell rows or some light
bent rows if you want to get better at
vertical
pulling do some pull downs do some like
uh cable latch rugs stuff like that like
those are gonna just have
exponentially more carry over into those
movements than i think
than these ones in particular and as
mike said they're just
for strength and hypertrophy they're
just not great it's okay if
it's something specific that you need to
practice like a skill or a sporting
type thing and that's fine if not i
would just do lighter versions of those
the movements that you want to get good
at 100
all right next up is lorenzo
theo vrolic
nice um he
asks has your selfish desire for
symbolic immortality
been the driving factor for these videos
with views accumulated by
thousands of souls and ornament to be
displayed
you know this reminds me dr mike's
christmas tree is like all the viewers
from this youtube channel
right that's reminds me of um dolph
lundgren
in a universal soldier with jean-claude
van damme where he had a
necklace of people's ears and oh yeah
yeah so here's let's do a james let's do
one of our little
little uh just forgot about that let's
do a little
mike and james style ferreting into the
the actuality of something like that
this is what james
you guys wanna preview what james and i
do when we hang out with each other in
real life this isn't much of a
conversation
james what do you suppose that smells
like oh my god
mike i was just literally in the i was
in the back of my mind i was thinking
about
high school football and how stinky my
ears would get in the helmet i was just
thinking exactly that like that must
smell
so fucking bad and they're cut off so
they're necrotic
they're rotting dude and they're on a
fucking necklace which is right below
your own nose
ear goo what is that called cerumen it's
it's so yeah
so stinky so nasty fuck ah gross i'm
literally i was literally having a
flashback as you were talking like man i
remember my helmet used to smell like
ass because my ears would be so gnarly
i would like for that movie to be or
just a universe of that movie mike and
james to pop up and be like dolph come
here look
we love what you're doing symbolically i
get it it's like crocodile teeth or
shark teeth
the thing about those two things is they
dry out really quick and then they don't
smell
and ostensibly you would wash them
people's ears
don't have any of those qualities we
just highly recommend for your own
sanity
cleanliness disease risk that you i
don't know
i like to take with people's teeth on
there i like to take those movie things
out of context too because i was
you imagine dolph dolph lundgren leaving
his apartment like okay keys
wallet phone check good check oh oh oh
almost forgot
fuck you're not your necklace
i can't you know people always ask me
when i don't have it on they're like
you're the ear necklace guy where's your
necklace i'm like you guys
that used to happen to me at temple a
lot because i would forget my
my badge oh fuck you know and i show up
to work like fuck
you guys know me look at my face like i
have an office up there just let me up
there
no i gotta call somebody i'm like come
on
get uh my other faculty members vouch
for me can someone come downstairs and
say this man belongs there's literally a
room with my name on it
they're like well what's your name if
you don't have an id card you're like
fuck
all right next up is none other than
link of insanity what a
bold name link of insanity
i wonder if it's like a zelda reference
like link there's the main character
yeah maybe uh
i hate uh burps that cycle back down
into your stomach and never
get out sometimes they're really painful
you're like i don't want this back in
here
all right um if you want to get to a
certain weight
but also become as strong as possible
for that weight without any plans of
competing
would it make more sense to train more
like a bodybuilder just massing and
cutting until you reach your desired
size
and then just do strength and active
rest blocks until you reach your
strength potential no not really
because the technical architectural
and neural effects of strength training
can like take
years to optimize the kind of muscle
fiber you add
be it faster twitch or slower twitch can
actually make a pretty big difference in
your eventual strength
so in what we would recommend
is a sliding scale so first of all
before the sliding scale if strength is
your eventual goal
you need to make sure that your
hypertrophy training is designed to
potentiate your strength training
so no sets of 30 no forearm curls
compound mostly hardcore heavy movements
that's a 5 to 10.
the derivatives like you don't just want
a normal bench you could close per bench
you could do jam presses and dips but
sets of 5 to 10
is the kind of range of loads that adds
great size while also making it very
easy to transition into strength and
adds the most strength potentiating size
right
so a lot of bodybuilders are enormous
it's not nearly as strong as you would
expect it would take them years and
years and years of doing what you should
have been doing to begin with
to do that now the next question is if i
want to heal
a large measure of both size and
strength how much should i prioritize
that sets of five to ten hypertrophy
uh training versus sets of like three to
six strength training
i think james and i would both say some
measure of both is needed but you bias
more to one or more the other as a
fraction of your average training year
depending on how close you are to your
eventual weight of muscularity that you
want
so if you weigh make a comical example
if you're six seven and you weigh 200
pounds
you want to be as strong as possible uh
with your frame
you're going to be doing probably sets
of 5 to 10 for like 10 years without
doing a set of three to six
until you get to 400 fucking pounds and
then you do lots of three to sixes after
that
on the other hand if you weigh 190 and
you want to be 200
a lot of your training is gonna be such
a three to six
um and really just in the strength stuff
with you know every
two or three months here two or three
months here you're gonna do some
hypertrophy work
to really layer in the muscle make it
stronger layered and make it stronger
and then five years later you'll be at
200 strong as fuck doing mostly
strength training so it's not either or
it's depending on how much weight muscle
you want to gain you bias you're
training more
as a fraction of the year into that five
to ten range and away from three to six
but um
you never really wanna and i kind of
misspoke even if you're doing the brian
shot thing where you have to gain 200
pounds at least once a year for
a mezzo or two should be doing sets of
three to six just to develop technical
abilities
and neural characteristics for maximum
strength that's where eventually you're
going to be swimming in the deep end
james
yeah great answer i think as mike said
it really depends on like how close you
are
to your body composition related goals i
think that's going to dictate how much
time you kind of divvy up between the
year
because those things just tend to take a
long time so i was imagining it
initially as like somebody who was maybe
over fat
and trying to slim down but i think just
reading it i think he was saying massing
and cutting
um so it could just be like a cyclical
thing and that's one of those things
like you might actually have
one year where you did like six or seven
months of massing just because you had a
lot of room to fill out
and the rest of the year rep sorry the
rest of your training year
had only a small fraction of strength
training but then the next year you
might find yourself doing more strength
training because you're happy with
where you are muscular muscularity-wise
etc so you don't have to have like a
perfectly
even split or you don't have to have
like a perfect like linear process of
like okay i'm going to mass cut mass cut
and then i'm going to do strength it's
just
you kind of play it by ear depending on
where you are in terms of body
composition what i wouldn't do and mike
already said this
was to just go all in on the bodycomp
stuff and never do the strength stuff
that would probably be a big mistake
but for example if you are already
pretty jacked
and pretty lean you might find that your
massing and cutting cycles are shorter
and shorter throughout comparatively to
somebody who's trying to put on a lot of
weight
and then you might actually spend a very
large chunk of time like three to six
months doing strength training
it just to really start to accumulate a
lot of good technique and heavier and
heavier loading so it can go a lot of
different directions
don't pigeonhole yourself into just like
one process
100
all right darren hawkins is up next
adam uh
interesting question james i'll just let
you take because this is all your
specialty right here
oh boy he says my doctor is a
bodybuilder and he does the inversion
table for decompression and uses the
theragun red light therapy
for the recovery benefits also
recommends dead hangs for shoulder
health is there any mirror to these
is this something bodybuilders should
implement do they serve any purpose at
all
thanks boss in this case james hoffman
hit it frost
okay so i'll try and take these one by
one so farragun
is there any major benefit to you know
recovery and or bodybuilding training
i would say no the theragun can actually
have the same kind of temporary effect
as like doing foam roll or myofascial
release so if there's some movements
where
you're having a hard time because of
flexibility and mobility limitations
you could use the theragun and that
could help you actually have really
excellent technique
in a movement that you would otherwise
be restricted in and let's just say it's
let's just use an example of like a
really good
sfr kind of movement like maybe um you
just you don't get a lot out of doing
like hip hinge movements because you
can't go very far
like classic example like you can't do
stiff legged deadlifts or good mornings
very far 45 degree back raise because
you're so inflexible
you could theragon and then for a little
while like for that for the duration of
that session
you might actually be able to get a
really good hip hinge and then have a
really stimulative bit of training
that's great
is there any benefit outside of that not
really uh red light therapy
there are some limited uses for red
light therapy in terms of recovery but
they all seem to be pre
almost exclusively therapeutic in nature
meaning they're not like performance
enhanced thing
and they're really not geared towards um
people who are otherwise healthy and can
do normal things like taking light
sessions and you know
relaxation stress management kind of
stuff i think the red light therapy is
is probably more applicable for people
who have
major major major movement limitations
because they're injured or have some
kind of chronic problem if they
just can't move very much so i would say
probably not and
the red light therapy is relatively new
so don't don't uh you know
hold it against me if something new
comes out and says it's awesome but at
the at the current time that's my
interpretation of that
uh dead hangs for shoulder health i
don't know
ah i don't know i'm not i see a
mechanistic description of how the fuck
that's supposed to work i think like you
you could probably just do some shoulder
flexibility mobility training and get
probably an even greater benefit if
you're having issues there
um inversion table i think i skipped
over on accident
yeah hit or miss hit or miss some people
it like does help their uh if they're
having like lower back
spinal issues sometimes like s.i uh
issues it can help alleviate some of
that pain
sometimes it doesn't i think it's kind
of try it see if it works for you and if
if it works great if not then
don't do it yeah
great answer james thanks
ein brown
got it always get the hitler
references in my head when i hear the
german names i always think of a
cowboy bebop when i hear iron brown
because the dogs
[Laughter]
i spent many a weekend
evening watching episodes of cowboy
bebop on toonami
and thinking about what's her name is
titties
oh i know god and she wasn't like
remotely sexual either she just happened
to be hot
and she wasn't like like a sex symbol or
anything and i was just like
well you know i was like 14. so
irrelevant fucking titties out there
everything's a sex symbol
they do that in anime because you'll be
like getting into an anime because it'll
have like a cool you know
story or setting or whatever and then
they put the fucking like sexuality out
there and you're like oh this is so
distracting now i gotta masturbate so i
can go back to watching the show exactly
all right
merry christmas ein brown says should i
address my calories during deloads that
occur inside a massing phase
for example drop two maintenance
calories versus maintain
previous surplus versus go halfway in
between so
halfway in between is actually probably
the optimal and the way you would do
that
is half of your d-load week you would
stay in a surplus the first half because
all that shit you put into motion of
hypertrophy wise is still cranking and
hardcore for half a week
and then the second half of the week you
would go just down to maintenance
the simple answer is just go to
maintenance but if you want the advanced
answer
there it was yeah and like again one of
the things that tends to come up in in
our weekly webinar is issues of like
optimality versus practicality and so
like you know optimality is probably
like the halfway option
uh the practical option is just to just
to keep on your maintenance or just even
just keep doing what you were doing at
for the time being and not fuss too much
about it
i find like i personally find with
myself and a lot of my clients like
having them do kind of intra mesocycle
dietary changes just gets them off of
their routine and ends up doing
more harm than good in many cases some
people are really good about it some
people you can say like yeah
adjust up but just down a little bit
other people it's like look
i got i got one thing that i'm gonna do
that's this whatever spreadsheet you
sent me that's what i'm doing i don't
want to do anything else
fine great just do that yeah
all right phillip grammat
gramatic grametokovsky
gramatikowski some of these names are
really funny okay i can't find it so i'm
going to do this search
it's f-i-l-i-p european phillip philippe
got it all right why do some muscles go
from
rp5 to fail in one rep maybe it's
hyperbolic but it rather feels like the
brains
turn off than the muscles actually
failing
um what considerations for those muscle
groups do you have
i find those muscles harder to train
because most training is neither
fatiguing or stimulating
what has worked best so far is higher
session volume until i get
at least three hard sets at moderate
reps six to twelve usually
end up around seven to eight sets per
session he asked i asked about stubborn
muscle groups such very high volume
benching and james
asked if i was focusing on powerlifting
i said yes poverty bench for life and
okay squad and deadlift those and my
shoulders
that does not trouble me okay so pretty
bench
yeah been there why do some muscles go
from rp5
to fail in one reps multi-factorial
answer one is probably a
person not really good at detecting rpes
that's uh
probably number one uh as you get better
at detecting them you get
um you get uh
to see the sort of the fractal
differences between
five and one better um some muscles
uh are innervated in such a way or
essentially
not so much innervative but the central
nervous system that controls them
fundamentally is
sort of built in such a way and or their
fiber type is such probably more faster
twitch on average
that they just give out really quick um
so what you have to do is just know that
those are your muscles
do your best to try to hit the rpes that
you have to
and go and go from there and auto
regulate as needed for more volume
at the end of the day it doesn't really
matter what rpe you hit
uh the auto regulation for volume works
the same way
like after whatever happened happened
you did three sets
do you have a good pump do you feel a
robust disruption to the muscle
did you feel that the you know the
muscle is starting to lose performance
and tire
if those are no then you keep going if
they're yes then you stop
so uh in some muscles it just sneaks up
faster
it's not even some muscles it's some
exercises that sneaks up faster
that's the route i was going to go yeah
so go ahead james feel free no
that was literally what i was going to
say there are just some exercises even
if you
are not necessarily fast twitch where
they just get you for some reason i was
thinking like
depending on how you're built and stuff
like for me it was like deadlifts where
i was like i'm a deadlift machine
everything's great everything's great
i'm done vomit like
and honestly you what you really want to
do is if you know
that your certain exercises are like
that for your certain muscles
you should get really good at knowing
when you really do have like that one
rep left in reserve
stop there every time but for the last
week
and just put five two and a half pounds
on the bar next time
and know to stop there again so you can
you could perfectly find or run an
entire meso with one rir
if you can't do any better than that if
the next one's either five rer or zero
rer
one rar is pretty unequivocal like you
know you got one rep left
you should get really good at finding
out when that's the case and then
stopping there
and then it's just that's just the cards
you're dealt with the good news is that
you don't have the opposite problem
so a lot of people would get jealous of
folks that can grind right
you can't grind so to you the shit is
really open and shut it's like okay i
was on our ir
someone's like yeah couldn't you have
done more and you're like nope i know my
body i know my muscles i know this
exercise i couldn't have done anymore
the grinders have the worst problem in
my opinion because they're always
thinking
can i could i have done more and the
answer sometimes is yes you could have
and then they think it's two rir but
then it's one and then it's one and then
it's one and then it's one and then i
shit
or you know they grind grind grind grind
and then it sneaks up on them
so because you can't grind it actually
simplifies training to a significant
extent
uh if you could grind a lot you know the
answer's still the same
is grind pretty hard not too hard in
your first week
at five pounds go from there try to
match the reps and when you can't match
the reps
you're done grinding and your message
cycle is done that's one of the really
awesome benefits of that
the system james and i use the rep match
or beat system versus just trying to do
a certain rar
arbitrarily every time is like you hit
your first week's rar three or four and
you look you're not that sure that it's
three or four neither are we
but you know it's pretty tough and then
you add a few pounds every time
and you add maybe a rep or two every
time and eventually you're just gonna
hit the wall you have to unless you
continue to get stronger linearly
forever
so that means it's all high quality
training it's all overload training and
it lasts a certain amount of time and
it's auto-regulated as to how long it
lasts
that's it man that's that's really where
it comes down to and this is not really
a problem
it's just a certain situation and it's
not even the worst of the two possible
extreme situations
yeah and i think that this is one of the
big benefits that some
machines have over free weights where
often you can use really small weight
increments and there's not as much
opportunity for your technique to be
really efficient and kind of break down
in such a way that causes this type of
problem
i know like for me like if you're doing
like low bar squats as soon as you have
one bad
rep it just feels like you're done
you're just like oh no no no
done done um whereas like on a leg press
you really can't fuck it up that bad i
mean you can there's obviously
nuanced and good technique with leg
press but ultimately like if you're
doing a leg press
you have pretty good technique you can't
really like waste too much energy on the
leg press likewise
chest pressing machines stuff like that
so that is one advantage
to using a machine where you can use
really small weight increments and it's
like pretty hard to go
if in that five to one rir type
situation
boom next up
ismar sachirovich
i'm just gonna go for it let's see ismar
[Music]
he says first he says
or lastly he says ps mike always nails
my last name hey benefits of being
eastern european
pps i am at uh
moloslova which means not many words
on instagram uh small word
i don't know what the fuck it means in
his god forsaken slavic language that
isn't the perfect sloppy language like
russian god damn it um
by the way like the hillbillies in
america that think america is always
right fucking europeans mexicans and
everyone isn't as good as us
russians the average russian is like 10
times more ethnocentric
like when russians hear like polish
being spoken
or serbian they're like it's like missed
a version of our language
and it's like maybe yours is a messed up
version of theirs you dumb asshole
russians jacob literally did that to me
once we were watching uh ufc and it was
one of the dogestani fighters he was
like dude this guy is such a hamacha i
was like what is that
like it means like hillbilly guy who
lives in the mountain 100
but that guy really is a hillbilly guy
all right uh oh by the way
oh i was actually close i just made some
shit up yeah it's pretty
pretty racist but again russians have no
problem with it
neither do they really because being
insulted by a russian is kind of like
the jokes on that guy
right right like the people in the in
the south of russia who live in the
villages they have
good lives strong families and um a
continual will to live with purpose that
russians don't
kind of like oh russian insulted me what
are you going to go do be an alcoholic
damn also their food is better than ours
so we eat their food and nobody eats
russian food like true northern russian
food is a fucking dog shit
i know i know you guys are going to lose
it next webinar i know we're going to
get comments like
have you ever had xyz yes i've had it
all it's not that good there's a couple
good russian foods caviar
is a fine food anyway we're gonna have
some russian food soon you guys come
visit
it's gonna be fun the dogs are gonna try
to eat all the food
they're pretty good about like we never
give them anything so they they they're
actually pretty good they um
they they don't really pester us for
food too much low on the other hand
oh yeah watch crystal because she's
gonna feed the dog yeah i'm gonna
i've got my eye on her the dogs also
vomit a lot like they have really
sensitive stomachs
oh god every morning like 5am they're
like
[Music]
jesus christ that's like a cat i haven't
slept
for like had a like a solid sleep for
like
six months at this point fucking you'll
be right when you guys have kids it'll
be easy because you'll be like this is
nothing compared this is nothing to me
yeah all right
uh ismar uh says
um what are your thoughts
on adding a new high rep exercises at
the end of a meso example for one
session or yeah okay week one three sets
week two four sets i assume it's all the
same exercise week three five cents
week four five cents plus one
metabolites
metabolitis set and then week of five
five sets plus two metaboliter sets
and that's i assume that's on a
different exercise
um i have done exactly this
and it ends up just being a huge waste
of time
can you dig in a little bit more games
yeah yeah so it's one of these like it's
kind of like some people like to use the
term uh
finisher like something to kind of like
finish the workout hard
right say that's kind of the same idea
you do like a metabolite thing to kind
of finish out the workout
um what you end up finding is that it's
like impossible
to track and to tell what it is you're
doing if anything
it's really ripe with false positives
because you could be having like a
really stimulative great session
doing for example five to ten reps and
then
everything might be going really good
and then you just do a metabolite thing
at the end and you get a big pump just
because you're doing high reps and it's
different from what you were doing and
you kind of get like a fault
type what we call a type one error false
positive you're like wow
this is so much better than what i was
doing before i should do more of this
when in reality maybe the the five to
ten you know bench press that you were
doing was actually
just banging in terms of raw stimulus
magnitude maybe even sfr
and you're just kind of this other thing
just makes you feel a little more pumped
because you do higher reps et cetera
so uh generally what i would find is
that it's hard to track
it's hard to know if you're making any
progress and since it's done at the end
of a workout it's very hard to tell if
it's
if you're if you are making any progress
at all because as you're indicating
you're already adding sets on the front
end
so now it's like one of my whatever
happens on the back end just kind of
falls wherever it is so it's kind of
hard to know if you're making progress
and then the ultimate kind of the thing
that really sunk in for me
was like why am i doing this and not
just more of the things that i know
was already going really well so if i
have gas in the tank to do this shit
i probably have gas in the tank to do
the the meat and potatoes more of the
meat and potatoes of my workout
and that was kind of the big epiphany
for me on that so i have tried it
i uh i did play around with this idea
and i did not find it to be useful
maybe i wasn't doing a very good job but
i find that
having dedicated periods of like if you
want to include metabolite style
training stuff it's just better to do it
as like a mesocycle thing
rather than like as a flavor enhancer
type thing
totally you know it's trippy james is
the longer i train and
the more like over the last two years
especially rather than perjury book
has solidified so many training ideas
for me
that whereas before i could use the
excuse of well we don't really know and
this kind of other
training is fun now i know better and it
eats at me
and like jared and i have and charlie
for sure have gotten really bad at like
when we travel together to a new gym we
like try as closely as possible to
approximate what we're doing at home but
then like when the machine isn't right
or whatever we have to pick something
else
we're like oh like we should have just
stayed at home
like you know what i mean like when
you're when you're leg press
when you hit 500 for 15 13 11 last week
next week and the week after the week
after so fucking obvious what to do like
it's 505
510 550 easiest thing in the world you
ensure you're working hard enough
your technique is great you can play
with it to get even better sfr you don't
have to figure shit out it's dependable
you can track your progress really well
it's awesome
but like you travel and there's a
different leg extension or hash squad
you have to do this awkward phase of
figuring out your stances like jared and
i did a pretty cool video
where him and i trained and did legs uh
last friday and it was super hardcore
workout and all that shit but like
for the hack squad especially was kind
of a weird hack squad like pretty
unusual because the plate is adjustable
and
um we had to like move our feet like six
times in the plate three times during
warm-ups
to get like a decent hit in in my last
set was the best because i finally
figured out where my feet were supposed
to go
and i was like like you know people
because people like
people say like i love going to new gyms
and trying out new equipment i
also do but it's bittersweet now where
it used to just be sweet
because now like i'm so locked into the
movements i'm doing i'm so high stimulus
to fatigue ratio
that when i have to travel on alter
things i'm kind of like this is fun and
all but i know that i would just rather
have the consistency
you know for sure i i still fall into
that trap and i uh
i always allow myself a little bit of
experimentation room in my mesocycle so
i don't
so like i i love going to a new gym and
if i see a piece of equipment that i've
never
used or totally i'll be i'll try it now
if it kind of fits within whatever i was
doing for that day i'll give it a go
i remember i uh i've when i was in
philly not too long ago they had one of
the uh
the glute bridge machines that you put
the seat belt on and i was like oh i
haven't done that one before i'll give
that one a go
um you know just to give it a try it's
you know and i thought it was lame but
whatever
uh belt squat was another great one we
were on the road in australia i've been
seeing the belt squat and uh we came
across one and i was like oh
why don't i try that turns out it was
great um so it is good to try these
things but like mike said you end up
it ends up throwing a big wrench into
everything because you are already
dialed in
with whatever it is that you're doing so
for me that issue is like
kind of a food for thought for later
kind of thing not and then maybe if you
can if you can
fit it into your next block or next mess
oh great if you're not
oh well yeah and and people say okay but
how does this work at home
like the question is asking like exactly
metabolite i could add it at home and i
could have a dependable
machine but like so for example one of
our leg workouts here in las vegas
is we do um some kind of hip hinge
usually
have our good morning or stuff like a
doughnut depending on the mesocycle or a
um
lying leg curl and then we do this ball
or selectorized hack squat that we have
which is just like pure sex to your
quads
and then after jared will do smith
machine squad and i'll do free weight
squat
and like i could do two sets of free
weight squad
and do like a set of lunges or a set of
leg extension drop center we have all
kinds of cool machines
but i'm so tuned in to that high bar
squat after pre-exhausting with a hack
squat
there is nothing better i could possibly
do for my quads as far as stimulus to
fatigue ratio
than a third set of the very squats i am
now
unreal potentiated for you know james
you do a couple sets of squats
especially if you're exhausted like glad
extension leg press
and you feel everything in your quads
you're completely upright in every rep
especially when you hit the deep crease
part it's just like
parking your quads up i have weak ass
quads i can't do pre-exhaust
right right that's true you would just
ends you all together
might be but you know like when you have
an exercise you're really just figured
out
now i know someone's like you've been
doing it for three weeks like don't you
want to throw in something different
you're like don't even understand
because i've been doing it for three
weeks it is the ideal
like i know it's boring and i know it's
just gonna be a set of eight
literally where it could have done drop
sets and sets of 20
but like there's nothing better than
this for me right now
and i can track it and i can increase it
slowly over time
because i i tell you what guys like at a
higher level of a higher level of weight
around flag
when you're more advanced it's tough to
know you're doing the right thing
because growth isn't as obvious anymore
especially when you're mean you have all
sorts of special sports supplements in
the mix and your body weight doesn't
tell you shit anymore
you have to standardize everything you
can so that you can have these ins
albeit small indicators of okay i'm
making progress like
my skull crushers went up with the same
strict technique
by like 20 pounds this last block for
sure my tricep screw there's just no
other way i'm already really good at the
smith machine skull crushers it wasn't a
neural thing and
but if i was doing different tricep
movements every time if i was throwing
in bullshit
i thought yeah i'm getting great pumps
and shit but like are my triceps really
bigger and for me at my level
it's not a guarantee that they will get
bigger nothing's a guarantee anymore
because people say like well just train
hard and you'll be fine like
it's an intermediate that's completely
true as a beginner it's more than true
but as an advanced person like
you want some things to be stable and
repeatable so that you know you're not
just quote unquote training hard because
that might not be enough
yeah i totally agree so our friend ismar
here
stick to kind of the meat and potatoes
avoid the fun sexy things and then
also take inventory on your your effort
for the sessions like if you have
effort and time to do fun sexy stuff at
the end you probably had more effort and
time to put in into the harder stuff so
it's a it's a it's a hard pill to
swallow i get it it's one of those where
you have to look in the mirror and be
like fuck
i stop i suck i just gotta do more
squats or more bench or whatever it
doesn't have to be that but you get the
idea
yeah and if you pick good stimulus ratio
exercises to begin with
you won't want to leave them why
wouldn't i want to squat i love it it's
fucking awesome for me
if james is doing like super deep leg
extensions on a good machine
there is nothing better so like people
are like do you want to do lunges
instead he'd be like
no like it's not that i'm bored it's
like this next set is gonna fuck me
better than anything else possibly could
where am i and especially because you're
already warmed up for it
so that's another real quick thing while
beating this to death is like you have
these exercises that you're getting
really really good at
and you're throwing in a third one like
a couple more sets of the regulars
are going to be so on the money because
you're so greased into them now
like why would you do a random new
exercise because there's a good chance
that exercise is going to go great
great sfr it's awesome but there's also
a good chance that you do a set and
you're like
and someone's like what do you think
chest and you're like i don't know man
my shoulder joints kind of hurt
i should have just done another set of
fucking dumbbell press because i just
did three
why did we switch the exercise and this
is a knock and this will be in the book
james and i have on a lot of what
bodybuilders do which is like five or
six exercises per session
and one to two work sets per exercise
all right
it's like what are you doing once i'm on
the incline bench
sets three four and five feel better
than sets one and two like i'm grooved
in
i don't wanna move also you gotta unrack
all those weights
re-rack re-warm up for another fuck all
that shit
once you have your shit figured out up
to five and james and i was saying the
book five to
seven cents is really
totally fine and close to ideal for
staying on a fucking machine
that's it yeah and one last point we've
belabored this one a little bit and the
other direction
uh actually the last time mike and i
went to thailand for some fun times we
went to a gym and mike's like oh you
want to
work out i was like let's do workout
together and i think mike was gonna do
like four ish sets of leg
curl machine and since i've been working
out at home i don't have that and uh i
have can only do hip hinge at home
so he's like all right let's do four
sets i was like bro i'm gonna do like
one set and i'm gonna be overreached but
i have like an ego problem so i'm gonna
do two sets just to make call it two
and sure enough two sets like fucked me
into oblivion
because it is such a good sfr movement
for me i just don't do them because i
have limitations of
home gym stuff right same idea so like
another thing of when you see
new fun things like you have to it
really does just become overly
disruptive
if you just change up what you normally
do at that point it might have just been
better for me to just do more good
mornings or something so i could have
kept a routine yeah all right last
question you know
it turns out james that once now so it's
elliot uh
ephraimov if you want to look at that
um it's kind of exactly the same
question as was already asked
unfortunately
what does it mean when muscles go from
perfect to failure in the space of one
rep
um yeah for example say it yeah
we can answer this real quick and just
actually i'll pick another one or james
you could pick another one in the
interim
uh say a set of pullovers the target is
15 and when you reach 14 it's just as
good an
identical difficulty as reps 5 to 10 but
then rough 15 is complete failure we
can't even do full range
but that's a really good thing that
leaves like we we said on the other
answer that basically the same question
it leaves a lot of ambiguity out like
you know when you're pretty close to
failure
failure then you can just stop at 14
next week and just do like two and a
half more pounds or something
so i mean that's just somehow some some
muscles fail
uh that pullover specifically most
machines are designed
with one ultra mega obvious sticking
point
and you get through that shit or you do
not get through that shit
so there's no grinding through some
sticking points it's just not to happen
um and and that's okay and that's okay
look the other alternative would be
probably worse where you could just
grind guy and ryan you never know what
failure is so
just know when that rep is coming up
stop one short of it and then just put
more weight on the bar
james did you pick anyone else i did
pick one it's not the like
spiciest question in the world but i
feel like you're going to have a strong
opinion on it so that's why
oh boy all right so who is it if div
uh iv div i was gonna say what uh
so he asked someone there's my screen
i'll go ahead james
so he asks hi doc's i was wondering if
there is any merit
to doing barbell hack squats if you
don't have access to a hack squat
machine
so as we all know dr mike loves him some
hack squats so we're trying to figure
out
if dr mike and i'll i'll chime in too
but i'm curious as to what dr mike's
opinion on the barbell hack squat
variation is
you sure can't pick them james
everybody has their own sfrs right i
just want to hear what mike mike's
opinion on it is
if dave this is absolutely not a knock
on you whatsoever james and i seem to
make that uh
caveat a whole lot when answering
questions was nonetheless true
um barbell hack squats
may be on the fundamental
average guesses one of the worst sfr
exercises
you could ever try it's like someone's
like what's the sfr for quads if you run
into a fire hydrant
just with your dick like i don't know
everyone's as
far as different i'm gonna say low um
barbell hacks is i don't even know what
to call barber hacks it's a deadlift
with your fucking hands
behind your back yes think that through
it does leverage your knees forward but
it's
always and everyone unless you have
weird dinosaur arms it's always in
everywhere a real partial range of
motion exercise
i don't know but it gets better it is
limited by your grip
which is awful and then it's also
incredibly axially fatiguing
and also very uncomfortable and unstable
i mean
it has pretty much everything going
against it that you could
think of um it is not remotely like a
machine hack squat which has
none of those limiting literally none
and it leverages you perfectly to hit
your quads
so i think for most people barbell hack
squats are fucking gigantic waste of
time
it but try them and then i promise you
99 times out of 100 after two warm-up
sets
you're going to be like fuck that
james i i mean i you know me i i pretty
much largely agree i think it's really
dumb and i've tried using it it's
something that i have tried to do and if
you guys think like the
jefferson lift yeah fuck jefferson if
you guys think scraping your shins
on the front side of with the deadlift
imagine how it feels to scrape on the
back side which is not used to that at
all um especially if you're like me and
oh just awful
yeah it's really it's really
uncomfortable to hold that position i
always felt like odd spinal compression
where i was just like this
yeah not how this is supposed to go
um and i've played around with it i did
see a video i want to say it was like on
instagram
somebody had a kind of a what i thought
was an interesting setup for that
where they got one of those heel wedges
you know what i'm talking about i can
see where this is going
yeah they basically set up like a very
high heel with the wedge
uh version of that and it seemed like it
was working well for them but they were
obviously
you know and if you do it to a deficit
or you load small plates on you can
actually get a very good range of motion
yes but the holding it behind you does
not exit awkwardness it is
awkward and the you know one of the
problems with that one too is
unlike a machine hack squat which you
could feasibly do for sets of 10 to 20.
you cannot do sets of 10 to 20 on that
one even if you were using
a you know a strap or a versa grip or
something it's just such an awful
position
it'd be like trying to do low bar squats
for says a 10 to 20. you just can't just
can't do it
so i think it's shitty you know
don't knock it till you try it so if
you're curious give it a shot um and i
think you will probably come to the same
conclusions that dr mike laid out where
it just
misses the mark on every possible option
i mean it really is the worst it really
does it's
it's odd when an exercise fails every
single initial analysis of what's
probably
a shitty sfr move it's like wow short of
dropping it on your fucking heels like
it's up there as far as predictable dog
shit
and i it's also one of those like you'll
have guys saying like
well you know i know i'm not supposed to
be doing pull pull downs behind the neck
uh or whatever but like or shoulder
press behind the neck but i really like
it it doesn't bother my joints
there's enough guys like that on social
media that you're like oh maybe these
are exercises of merit
i don't know anyone on social media that
is like
barbell hack squats are the thing like
it's almost one of those like weird
1850s exercises that people who get
bored lifting regular weights
but like what do you think of the gear
the vince girionda press or whatever
like
you know let history die for the love of
god what do you think of the russian t4
g34 tank in world war ii
it was fine for world war ii today it's
awful
like same with all those other exercises
it's like literally like
machines were invented to do a better
job
so well that that was satisfying because
i knew you would have something to say
about that
for sure you sure picked it is that it
for today
that's it all right guys well i
now that i think about it it's going to
be after christmas what
probably by the time this gets posted so
for all of you celebrating happy holiday
season whatever it is that you celebrate
we hope you're having a good time with
friends and families and staying safe
out there
christmas hana kwanzaka ah that one
yes all of it and hopefully depending on
the timeline also
happy new year uh you know what's really
funny is a lot of people are like man i
can't wait for 2020 to be over what do
you think's gonna change
in january you see the stopping point of
the earth going around the sun is
arbitrary and invented by humans
uh sorry yeah yeah good god people
2020 sucks like oh cool the year with
the most advances in biotechnology ever
sucks i got it anyway i don't want to
get on this fucking you know me
um james you and i are going to be
serendipitously together physically
for our next taping which means that oh
yeah we
don't have to say happy new year yet
because we'll almost certainly
uh be taping in a week and we'll be
physically in montana so
i just assumed that we were going to be
fucking off the whole time but yeah
we'll probably do another one
and there's a decent chance i'll be high
on marijuana but
all of just kidding i never i never uh
what should i say here that fuck it
these drugs are all becoming
decriminalized and it's not immoral
um i'm a pretty big fan of mushrooms i
only do them on occasion but
i don't microdose i'll put it to you
guys this way um
i'm uh come to a possession of some
mushrooms recently
and that's all i'll say and there was
like a joke this would never happen in
real life
of me like taking them right before the
webinar started today and then
seeing how many questions i could answer
before reality
i would never do that so i'm not going
to be high for the next webinars what
i'm trying to say
but it would be hilarious because the
idea if you're on mushrooms of some one
on the internet having in
previous time asked a question of a
domain of your expertise
that you supposedly have delivered
through
your best friend who's not really here
but is on video that's so many segments
of reality you take you literally take
for granted that you just know these
things
if you're on enough psychedelics you're
like what is happening
why are we talking about anything
amazing all right well folks we will see
you soon
happy holiday season keep asking those
great questions subscribe to the rp
youtube
see you soon peace
