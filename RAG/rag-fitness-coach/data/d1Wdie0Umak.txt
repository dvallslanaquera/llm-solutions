sculpt nation is essentially like a
parody of the supplement industry it's
what happens when you take
all of the worst aspects okay unproven
ingredients minimal dosages false claims
excessive prices and you just mash them
all together sculpination is what you
get as a result
what's up guys sean nalawani
realscienceathletics.com
and in today's video as the title says
we are going to be talking about
the undefeated undisputed fitness muppet
of the decade
and who else could that be other than
our friend v shred
now moving forward i'm trying to keep my
critique style videos
a bit more focused on just the objective
information
rather than focusing on the person but
in this case
uh that really doesn't apply okay vince
deserves all the criticism he gets
this guy just continues to [ __ ] his
way through life
what's going on guys and today we're
gonna be reviewing a recent video
uh no not the one where he shows you how
to perform a five minute
calorie burning workout from your bed uh
or where he teaches women how to get
long lean legs using body weight
exercises
this one is entitled five easy ways to
boost testosterone levels
naturally which is basically just an
advertisement for his
terribly formulated and insanely
overpriced uh testosterone booster from
his complete
tragedy of a supplement line sculpt
nation and i was originally gonna say
that he continues to [ __ ] everyone
with no shame but if you really pay
attention to vince's body language and
his videos
i think it's pretty clear that deep down
he really isn't happy about promoting
this stuff you can kind of tell that
he does not enjoy recording these videos
at all he always kind of looks
sad and stressed out whenever he has to
get in front of the camera
and put on this act he's always giving
away little tells like constantly
licking his lips
fumbling over his words swallowing
nervously so i think when it all comes
down to it he does
know at least on some level that he's
not being
completely honest to put it very lightly
when lying
people tend to experience severe dry
mouth
they may frequently lick their lips
liars are under an
immense amount of stress and tension
they have a lot of anxiety when people
start to lie if you notice that all of a
sudden hey this guy
they're really licking their lips a lot
what's going on it could be
some signs of deception now as a result
from that they could have some speaking
difficulties but this actually just
helps give me energy it's got a little
bit
caffeine in it so this is great to take
before every single one of your workouts
um
really good if you're trying to put on
muscle they may try to
swallow more most people do not enjoy
telling lies most people are not
naturally good at telling lies
therefore when they lie they know
consciously that it's wrong
they understand in their mind they have
a moral compass and they know that they
are not supposed to lie they are
supposed to tell the truth
so when they lie there's something
inside of them this is our conscience
it's a little voice inside our head
it's also our unconscious mind that is
pushing all of these
body language signs these truthful
behaviors out so it's a conflict between
let's just the conscious and unconscious
i really wouldn't be surprised if the
rest of the v shred owners are actually
sitting behind the camera during each
video and holding vince hostage and
threatening to shoot if he doesn't
cooperate
just read the lines vince just read the
lines and
everything will be fine and if you think
i'm being harsh here
uh i am you know there are a lot of
youtubers out there where we can just
disagree on fitness related topics and
that's fine but when it comes to vince
it's just a
non-stop stream of bs he makes blatant
false claims in his advertisements that
unless his iq is in the very bottom
percentile and maybe it is
but if not he must know that the claims
that he makes are not true
he sells supplements that are honestly
some of the very worst i've ever seen
i'm just looking at the dosages you can
see that they were clearly formulated
to just sprinkle in a tiny amount of
each ingredient to fully minimize the
production cost
and to take advantage of people who
don't know any better his fitness
knowledge is a complete joke i mean
this guy and his whole company basically
represents everything that is wrong with
the fitness industry what's going on
guys if you actually added up
how much money vince has probably made
selling these worthless products
i truly think you could make a case that
he belongs in prison which would be
really unfortunate because
i don't think vince would do very well
there anyway let's have a look at this
recent video which by the way i'll link
in the description box below if you do
want to check it out for yourself
after this critique is finished what's
going on everyone
vince here i know you're not that
excited vince calm down and today we
have a very special video on five easy
ways to boost
testosterone naturally so basically for
the first half of the video he just
gives
a bunch of really sort of generic tips
that most people
probably already know things like
exercise
eat healthy get enough sleep it's
basically just to set up the video to
where he can eventually push
his test booster supplement number one
get plenty of quality
sleep now number two is exercise number
three
watch what you eat now the fourth one is
stop
stressing out here it comes now
last but definitely not least is proper
supplementation
notice the uncomfortable swallow there
right before he starts talking about
this
and i'm sure you've seen the
advertisements for test boosters and
maybe even seen one for our sculpt
mission product
test boost yes vince we've definitely
all seen your ads okay i'm not
exaggerating here
probably 90 percent of the reason why i
pay 12
a month for youtube premium is solely so
that i don't have to see vince's face
pop up before every single video that i
watch
and six months into the subscription i
can definitely say uh with certainty
that it's been worth every penny
not long ago there was a group of
researchers that evaluated 50 different
test booster supplements
90 claimed to boost testosterone
however 61.5 had no data to support
their active ingredient claims
that's really not surprising at all and
given that your sales page has no
references whatsoever to support
the insane claims that you make about
this product you're definitely part of
that 61
and this is exactly why i wanted to do
this video i wanted to not only educate
you on why testosterone is important
vince you're not capable of educating
anybody on
anything other than how to deceptively
extract money from people over the
internet
that's literally all you do so on top of
doing the things that i just mentioned i
also put together a high-end
testosterone
supplement
our sculpt nation team developed our
test boost formula with
top of the line ingredients after
actually looking at the label on this
garbage supplement i can only assume
that this is the sculpt nation team that
researched and
put together this product so there's
eight ingredients in our blend
and i won't go through them all but i'll
do a quick breakdown of the four
that are the most critical and that you
should look for in any testosterone
supplement that you take
all right instead of listening to vince
lie his way through this ingredient
breakdown and claim that this product is
science based and clinically dosed when
it absolutely is not
let's just go through the label
ourselves and break it down and i'll
keep this brief because this really
doesn't take much time to debunk here
so here's the label and we'll start from
the bottom up 20 milligrams of cordyceps
so this is an interesting ingredient
with a variety of potential effects
it might have some minor effect on
testosterone levels
but any benefit that it might have is
completely irrelevant in this case
because the standard dose used in human
studies
is one thousand to three thousand
milligrams and our team of science-based
supplementation experts over at sculpt
nation
put in 20 milligrams so an utterly
worthless amount it's just hilarious
that he claims that this product
is clinically dosed when as you'll see
every single ingredient except for one
contains a fraction of what was actually
used in the research
they've got two types of ginseng which
is traditionally used as an adaptogen to
reduce fatigue there's no good evidence
that ginseng increases testosterone
levels
to any significant degree and the
standard dose for a lutheran caucus
which is siberian ginseng
is about minimum 300 milligrams up to
around 1200
and they've included 200 milligrams so
less than the very bottom end range of
the dose
and they include 20 milligrams of the
american ginseng which is absolutely
nothing again this is just
a completely worthless amount there's
uracoma which does have some pretty
decent evidence behind it for being an
effective
libido booster and there's some research
to show minor effects on testosterone so
if you're looking for an effective boner
pill then this ingredient might help
somewhat but you're not going to get
that effect from this particular product
since the normal dose is 200 to 300
milligrams and they're using
20 milligrams so that's roughly 10 of
the bottom end
range of the effective dosage hawthorne
berry i'm not sure why that's included
since there is
zero evidence for that ingredient as an
effective test booster and it's usually
not even marketed for that purpose
anyway
and uh it's way underdosed anyway 40
milligrams is nothing usual doses for
this ingredient are in the several
hundred milligram per day range
epimedium otherwise known as horny goat
weed
basically this ingredient is backed by
one rat study where it did increase
testosterone levels but only at an
extremely high dosage
and yet again v fraud v shred uh has
sprinkled in a totally useless amount
160 milligrams it's next to nothing for
this ingredient
and they don't state how much of the
active ingredient there is either
the actual active compound here is
called echarion
i think that's how it's pronounced but
most supplements will state what
percentage of that active ingredient
that they're providing you with
and of course sculpt nation doesn't
because they have absolutely no clue how
to properly label a supplement
next up is tribulus which also does not
increase testosterone levels except for
a potential
small boost in infertile men this is
another ingredient
that can have some potential libido
boosting properties
but the standard dose for the whole
fruit which is what they're using here
that's going to be around 2000 to 3000
milligrams per day
and they include 500 milligrams which is
highly unlikely to benefit you in
any noticeable way then lastly they have
ashwagandha as ksm66
at 600 milligrams now this is the one
ingredient in the entire product
that is at least properly dosed and can
be effective at reducing stress and
anxiety levels
which could have a small downstream
effect on testosterone levels but keep
in mind that
the research there is still not
conclusive and even if it does increase
testosterone levels it's still not going
to be high enough to actually
impact your muscle building results in
any significant way
which brings me to the final point here
on natural testosterone boosters in
general
which is that even if some of these
compounds do increase testosterone
levels when they're taken in the proper
doses
that does not actually mean that you're
going to build muscle or gain strength
any faster as a result of using them
in order for that to happen you need to
create very large and sustained
increases in testosterone which natural
compounds cannot produce or at least
no natural compounds that we currently
know of okay just because something
increases testosterone or
increases growth hormone or reduces
cortisol or whatever
that claim doesn't actually mean much of
anything on its own because it
ultimately comes down to how large
the increase or decrease is and how long
it's sustained for
trying to significantly raise
testosterone levels with these
over-the-counter test boosters is
basically like taking a piss in the
ocean and expecting it to overflow
now if you are deficient in certain
vitamins and minerals for example
vitamin d
zinc magnesium then increasing your
intake of those
can help to take lower testosterone
levels and assist
to some degree in kicking them back up
into a more normal range
especially when you combine that with
optimizing certain lifestyle factors
like proper training nutrition
sleep stress management etc but you're
not going to take already normal
testosterone levels and then increase
that into a super physiological range
without pharmaceutical assistance for
lack of a better word
i'm definitely not promoting this as a
testosterone booster but are
microcore multivitamin from real science
athletics which i personally formulated
using
actual clinical doses based on real
research and that i actually use every
day
microcore does provide the proper doses
of those three vitamins and minerals
among other things to help fully
optimize
your health and performance you can
check that out if you're interested it
goes really well in combination with our
o3 prime
fish oil product as a sort of overall
diet optimization combo you can click up
here for that
or use the link in the description box
below and you can use coupon code
youtube15 which will take 15
off your first order of that so the
bottom line is this
the bottom line is that sculpt nation's
test boost is essentially a 50
bottle containing one properly dosed
ingredient that might have a small
impact on testosterone levels but still
not high enough to significantly affect
your body composition
and then it has seven other ingredients
that either have weak research behind
them
or none at all and that are completely
and totally underdosed anyway
the mounds of research are pretty
conclusive
that you have either zero clue what
you're talking about or you do know what
you're talking about but you're just
intentionally misleading your audience
if you're looking to give sculpt mission
test boost a shot and flush your
hard-earned money down the drain to line
the pockets of this group of flaming
clowns uh yes this is team
v shred right here in case you didn't
know the high level health and fitness
experts who are behind all of this
nonsense
so that's all for this video i really
wish that was all for this guy's
existence in the fitness industry period
but i'm sure he'll be back again soon to
promote more [ __ ]
and it's pretty sad to see to be honest
because even looking at the like dislike
ratio on his video
it's clear that most of his audience are
absolutely clueless in this as well
which is basically what his entire
business model is based on selling
worthless garbage to people who
don't know any better sculpt nation is
essentially like a parody of the
supplement industry it's what happens
when you take
all of the worst aspects okay unproven
ingredients minimal dosages false claims
excessive prices and you just mash them
all together sculpt nation is what you
get as a result so thanks for watching
