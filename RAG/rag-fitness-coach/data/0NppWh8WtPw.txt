chest to the ground again go
again go now go now
up up one more go
go
[Music]
hey folks dr mike here i got my jitsu
shirt on
alec is here he's got his super clean
super fresh white shirt on
bad news is gonna have blood in it after
this workout jk
maybe we are going to do chest and back
training
just like arnold used to why are we
pairing chest and back
no particular reason but sometimes in
some program designs over the week
you'll be training chest and back in the
same session here's a cool way to do it
we have four exercises lined up four or
five what we're going to do first
is pull-ups of some kind we'll figure
out the grip width and the grip
structure in a second
if the reps drop below a certain amount
we might go to pull-downs or assisted
pull-ups to boost that volume because
we're going to be doing
all four or five sets of each movement
so if the reps drop below about five
not optimally hypertrophic anymore we're
going to replace it with an exercise
that allows us to get in more volume
at those quality rep ranges after that
we're going to be doing some bent over
rows we'll make a decision on if it's
going to be smith machine bent over rows
or barbell rows it's going to be
compound hardcore either way
after that we're done with back we're
going to be moving over into chest where
we're going to do incline barbell press
very likely
and then we're going to be doing some
real fun stuff ha ha
ha ha type of fun on a chest press
machine that means some drop setting
all that kind of cool stuff just four
exercises four or five depending on how
you count it
roughly four or five sets of each one
that gives us about 16 to 20 sets
total in a workout which is a really
pretty meaty session at the end of the
day
and really good for hitting the chest
and back and some of you might be like
yeah but that's not not a ton of volume
for either chest or back
for a week it's not so if you do this
kind of workout you want to do it at
least twice a week maybe even three
times a week
just varying the movements or repairing
just work out to work at the workout and
you'll have such a big chest and back
that people will say you're that weird
big chest and back guy
let's get to the first exercise
nice easy weight here folks we're just
warming up
warming up the nervous system for the
technique component
for the output component and also
getting the muscles physically warm
so we're ready to train both high output
and at a low injury risk
so typically when we warm up we're gonna
do
in most cases at least
one pretty light set of tennis or so and
at least one more set
of like four or five relatively heavy
and then we can go and do one or two
reps here on the actual pull-ups
to really get used to the true load we
don't want to rush our warm-ups you can
rush a lot of things in life
i would know i've rushed so much i have
nothing to show
for anything guys i'm morally bankrupt
from rushing
also being russian i guess same thing
but in any case
you want to take your time with warm-ups
even if you have a short time
make sure your warm-ups are quality if
you want to get hurt rush your warm-ups
the only thing i can say
folks alec is going to start he is going
to do only full range of motion pull-ups
which means two things one his head has
to clear the bar at the top
and also he has to get a full dead hang
at the bottom he is not going to be
doing any swinging
any crazy cycle movements just high
quality work
this is simulating a workout that you
would do at the end of a mesocycle so
all sets are going to be taken very
close to concentric failure
as far as rep counting i will only count
the reps that are
good and of high quality so you ready to
do high quality reps i'm ready to do it
boom let's get it done
nice and easy no pressure and down
one beautiful
two control the descent
excellent and up four
five beautiful work
six alec these are some of the best
pull-ups i've ever seen let's go
seven all the way down go
eight keep going i want one more at
least
move move move nine one more dude you're
the fucking man
you showed up for a reason go go go
go go slow slow
and that's it good job good work shit i
would have bailed on the
for sure maybe for sure maybe even the
six yeah
control
good at least one more
big moves up up up good
slow rest for a second
go up up up
up up slow control control control
control control beautiful that's it good
job
excellent work excellent work that is it
folks that's it for pull-ups
now we move on to our second back
exercise which is the barbell
bent over
all right folks alex done pull-ups four
sets
of roughly five to ten reps now he's
gonna be doing barbell bent over rows
he's a super tall guy he's like six
three so some people would say this is
an awkward movement
nothing awkward about it it's just the
range of motion is huge which means the
stimulus is awesome
yes the weight might be humbling if
you're taller but you're not in here
to try to impress yourself with how much
weight you're doing for a teeny tiny
range of motion
if you want to be like me with my little
alligator arms i can bent row 315 for
reps
who cares the purpose is to get a big
back which means whatever the load
corresponds with the number of reps you
want that's the one you use plain and
simple
let's get to work and stop right there
keep your chest up
begin to row zero momentum one you don't
have to stop at the top just gentle
touch
two perfect three
four back position looks really good
five
excellent we're training the whole back
lats
rhomboids erectors traps rear delts
even good four more big chest
16 no swinging 17
touch that tummy
18 come on almost there 19.
chest up come on let's go 20. beautiful
good stuff very good
take a break take a drink and then we
start training chest
so a question we'll probably get about
this workout is why didn't we stagger
the chest and back movements
why not let the chest recover while the
back is being hit vice versa so why not
do back chest back chest
or the other way around chest back chest
back why are we doing back first
all of it and then chest all of it
doesn't that deprioritize chest it does
but it allows us to smash our back the
most
when the systemic fatigue is the lowest
if you put one of the back movements
later
your systemic fatigue is higher like
just tired overall
and you've done a bunch of chest and
back and now you're doing back can you
get a good quality workout yes
but to the local muscle the local
fatigue probably has something to do
with hypertrophy systemic fatigue
doesn't
so we're maximizing local fatigue in the
back by doing it in the first two
movements
which probably gives us a slightly
better hypertrophy result
if you were training for strength that's
probably not the case staggering
movements would be better but for pure
hypertrophy it might be better
to squeeze them in together and then
move on to the next muscle group so
keeping your muscle groups contiguous
so back back chest chest versus
splitting them up like that
now you may say okay what if we do this
kind of workout
how the hell are we going to get a big
chest we're always training and tired
good
excellent critique but you're not going
to do one of these a week you may do two
or three of them
two or three chests and back days means
one of the days
you do back first like today we're doing
back first then chest
another day later in the week like on a
monday and wednesday and the wednesday
you might do chest first and then back
second both of them get a great workout
but chest slightly better so if you do
that
twice a week let's say monday thursday
then you have a chest back
and a back chest and together both
muscle groups get both an ability to
recover because they're not always being
smashed
and an ability to be put first on the
front burner to get the optimal stimulus
so over the week it all fixes itself
part two of the workout begins here with
the incline barbell press for
hypertrophy
we're going to be targeting sets in the
oh 10 to 15 rep range
on a first set and then letting fatigue
degrade us as we go
let's get it started good
keep going up alec you're doing great
keep it up
good breathe out only at the top breathe
out
good
[Music]
loving the control these are excellent
keep going
again good don't let that bar slow down
on you on the way up
speed excellent again
let's end on a high note up yes
one more let's go move
go go go excellent
excellent excellent good job very good
job
get a drink relax and then we begin push
up hell
all right folks we're gonna do machine
chest press but
during the conversation during training
when he wasn't vomiting blood
alec told me that he gets his best
stimulus to fatigue ratio for chest
just a few exercises and a push-up
especially with a deficit is one of them
so how are we going to be hypocrites and
ignore our own shit
high sfr exercises that's what we want
so
alec is going to be suffering deficit
push-ups
we're going to do oh what's going to end
up being around 4 sets but we got a few
intensity techniques planned
you might have seen them some of our
other videos before let's find out who
stays alive
folks we have three rules when we do
push-ups
rule number one every single repetition
the chest gently touches the ground
rule number two is every single
repetition the elbows come fully locked
out at the top every single time
rule number three your dick doesn't
touch the ground you're not doing dick
push-ups
we're doing push-up push-ups so you're
gonna keep your butt actually slightly
elevated
which most people would say to you that
that's bad push-up technique
but most people are fucking wrong
up one good
up two
[Music]
up up up up up by more you got more
get up rest don't go anywhere
again go
push that's it that's failure good
stuff up
nine
[Music]
up up up rest rest for a sec
one go move
good one go
go down on your knees
go from your knees
[Music]
excellent excellent
excellent keep going keep going we're
going to milk your chest for every
fucking thing that it has go again
up again go
come on man you got time to joke
motherfucker you're barely
trying go up again
chest to the ground again go
again go now go now
up up one more go
go
again go up
up up up up that's it
beautiful oh fuck
what the fuck was that
thank you sir good job thanks that's it
that's fun
folks thanks for tuning in
part training's tough you don't always
have to train like this
because in your first weeks of the
message cycle of your workout plan that
lasts one or two months
go a little easier leave a few reps in
the tank don't do as many sets
but then every single session pretty
much every single week you move move
move
add a rep here and there add five pounds
here and there if you're not getting
good pumps if you're not getting too
sore
add a set here and there and after about
oh four to six to eight weeks
you're going to be doing shit like this
and you're going to be barely surviving
the week after this you do de-load week
recover all that fatigue
and you proceed to start slow and easy
and work back up again next time
thanks for tuning in see you guys later
[Music]
you
