that was awful grab the bar do it again
you said you wanted to be on the channel
here you are on the channel
I Don't Wanna Cry seriously good you can
cry on camera it's okay you won't be the
first or the last
[Music]
folks I'm Dr Mike this is
I may be one of the only people in the
world to be able to say that because I
am from Russia originally she is from uh
Lithuania otherwise known as
which is uh it sure is Hell actually
easier to say in Lithuania here's the
thing with Lithuania they have at least
Lara who's an ifb bikini Pro but
Lithuania actually has like maybe half
of the world's strongest humans of all
time and the strongest man to ever walk
there is
just is King and God and Emperor and
everything that is man the real quick
question before we introduce the rest of
the video have you ever run into him in
real life
um actually yeah I believe I did but it
was very long time ago but you never
forgot because now you know how true
romance feels seeing a real man exactly
exactly yeah this is how it was perfect
like reading Romeo on Juliet but in real
life excellent when I saw him it was
much the same folks
good news islada is an unbelievable
shape she is two weeks out of a show
almost two weeks out we're gonna go hard
we're gonna train glutes we are going to
train hamstrings we're gonna do a little
bit of quad work because the judges are
like your quads are too big or whatever
what do they know just kidding judges
she's great
but that's the upside
the other upside is this anyone else we
have on the channel you can try hard and
it's totally cool yeah you cannot try
anything other than the maximum because
Lithuania has a strength lineage and
you're at the very top this is why I
need to show off time to show off time
to show off time to show off
[Music]
front foot on
back foot wherever it's comfy nice and
far back but it doesn't have to be
forever back
and here's the big deal this will be
easier when you have the bar in your
hands you want almost all of your weight
on the front foot the back foot you
stand on your toe is just for balance
yeah so front foot slow and controlled
Gentle Touch on the ground I'm still
putting all of the weight in the muscle
I can my foot back here is doing almost
nothing
and then come up and then again it makes
sense everything on the front right
everything on the front Smith machine
front foot elevated lunge
the critical thing here is to put as
much weight in the front foot as
possible and as little weight in the
back foot as possible
slowly controlling The Descent slower
slower slower than you think no matter
what you think it's slower on the way
down go real deep pause for a second and
come up gnarly and here's the other
thing people like to do one leg and then
switch and do the other leg don't switch
right away it's systemically fatiguing
do one leg rest like at least 15 seconds
30 seconds until you feel strong in then
go to the max leg it's like one arm rows
you don't switch right away it's one
separate set from the other
15. three more slow
we only count good reps
[Music]
16. again don't rest there's no rest
17 down
slow up that was too fast do it again
slow yes it's more hypertrophy for you
that's why you're here
yeah hell yeah now rack yeah there you
go perfect good rest it out
I'm gonna just cry in the corner oh
please wait for me
16. two more slow pause
up one last one make it good right away
slow pause up
yeah hell yeah rack oh shit
oh shit all day
all day
oh my somewhere is smiling right now
he's proud he's so proud yeah uh you
feel he's okay quads a bit Yeah because
my quads always tends to do quite a bit
of job with any exercise that I do yeah
you're doing curls you feel your body
exactly
good you can cry on camera it's okay you
won't be the first or the last
yes 13 down
14 down
[Applause]
15 you gotta pause at the bottom to get
this next one slow as hell or we do it
again
yes rap good stop good stops
okay rest it out a little bit
12. amazing almost there down

again Laura fix it you can do better go
slow
up beautiful one more left slow as hell
wait up
rap
[Music]
I'm so glad we are done here
oh to the turf to do deadlifts yay
next exercise is the Sumo deficit
deadlift couple cues here
wider than shoulder width stance
toes pointing further out than you think
is reasonable is usually the cue because
if you point them this way your knees go
over if you point them out your knees go
out your knees come out your back stays
nice and flat you're going to feel your
glute stretch already the deficit is to
put that fucking nasty stretch on them
and then stand back up and then slow on
the way down with a gentle
pause at the bottom of every single rep
and come back up if grip is an issue use
Versa grips or straps
double overhand is totally fine if
you're doing it for high purchase you
work do not bend your arms so when you
first get the bar straighten your arms
out put tension through your shoulders
and then come up it is not a fucking
bicep exercise I think it trains the
suffering muscle do you have tissues for
my tears uh your Lithuanian the blood of
your enemies will is where your tears
will go slow slower it doesn't count
wait
go go one more bonus round Laura your
Lithuanian wake up slow slow losing free
grip
and then slow it if you're gonna do
another one chest up slow slow
and drop
good stuff oh my God how many sets are
we doing here like 80.
we'll be here for hours I'll find 90.
