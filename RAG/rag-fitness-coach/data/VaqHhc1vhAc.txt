thank you
[Music]
okay don't go crazy I feel like you have
corrupted my shoulder hey folks it's me
Dr Mike for YouTube and it's RP's head
chef Mrs Lori Shaw and her two lovely
children Zach and Emma respectively and
they are going to compete with me in a
cooking competition to see who can make
mystery food I haven't been uh you know
informed about yet why are the kids here
well I've defeated every single other
Chef in combat the men and the women and
just like in attrition Warfare
eventually they give the kids AK-47s and
send them into combat these kids are
getting a spoon and spatula respectively
but it's a start shall we do battle
folks we're gonna wipe the floor with
you we're gonna beat you we've seen your
videos oh well they're confident they're
very confident
oh I think hands down they're going to
win okay so quote Michael Jackson the
cheetah's not my son Let's get to the
cooking
[Music]
cheating on us yeah you can't believe
you're at first it's a very simple
recipe the last time I followed a recipe
was also to make cookies like we are
today
and it was with my grandmother in 1992
350 oven line a cookie sheet with
parchment paper I did take pity on you
and do that for you this is a good news
because I don't know what parchment
paper is so it's digital interface it's
nice oh there's an analog section so I
hope this thank God that turns great and
then we don't want clean we want 350.
and I know how to turn a knob I think
so who made this okay that's
nerve-wracking okay for all of us all as
well combined banana through oats stir
in raisins
combine is oddly non-specific
oh there's a amounts oh thank God
two large ripe bananas mashed
that's how we do you use your teeth
looks at Banana examines audience dumps
banana without saying anything
you guys should re-watch this video when
you grow up it'll be a lot of fun
through oats
through it through
I can do this you have a plethora of
don't condescend to me Glory I've had
enough
art cooking's not a science forget these
numbers uh stirring raisins but how many
we look up the raisins and
algorithmically we determine that there
are 29 net carbs wait no one quarter cup
so you're all the way at the raisins
stage correct pretty good right
he's really big on the even sprinkle
it's looking really good and we're done
banana raisin nut cookies or whatever no
no it looks tasty and appealing like an
oatmeal an oat coated banana is
essentially what you've made when in
doubt move robotically I say that's how
I dance
not telling me thumbprint cookies
I'm not like Mary the butter girl who
does this this is tough my arm's tired
you know for real are we still here oh
my God it's still happening why isn't it
done yet uh use your other arm I was
gonna say that some combination of this
is as far as I'm going with this like
please put me out of our misery mix
thoroughly drop by even scoops on your
prepared pen I don't know what these
devices are they're everything they look
like scoopers everything's there that
you need that's totally even Mike
hey Zach
more of your advice is so needed
so that
that is an interesting point Emma
for big cookies
problem I noticed there are a lot of
other ingredients out here I haven't
messed with yet
I forgot a few ingredients but I'll fix
it watch
Safety First is the pan hot no there's a
problem there are three levels to this
oven and it doesn't say which level so
chalk that up against the book
unspecific in it goes
people actually do this isn't there a
factory where cookies come from I forgot
that
cinnamon vanilla and salt exist
bad news
but it's not something I can't fix
it says later to put the
the jam into the cookies in a little
dollop in the middle
but didn't say that it couldn't be a
little bit more cinnamony than usual Jam
salt goes in oh it smells so bad
let me smell it oh all right now we
clear the way for the children
[Music]
right right bananas match so start use
the instructions Emma where's the
parchment paper see see Zach aren't you
getting frustrated and how it could be
done faster honestly no I'm not because
I'm a patient guy unlike you and my dad
almost impossible move it you're on my
side Emma don't you feel like Zach's
taking a little too much credit for his
cookies
I think it's time for you to shop
careful are you sure you want to use
that you don't need to use another Bowl
it all goes in the same Bowl maybe you
made a mistake maybe you
maybe seven seven of them maybe I did
ah
a maybe Mike is right maybe I don't need
you hey oh wait wait wait
um hold on did we get everything we got
the salt vanilla cinnamon and oats is it
the pork or is it the Disney it's the
pouring mix thoroughly
okay don't go crazy I feel like you have
corrupted my children been used to make
one more cookie
ah
did you follow the instructions yeah
he's ready I don't need the instructions
anymore I have memorized them
and summarily improved them
and I'm done and the kids go to the oven
I didn't mean that literally completely
pressed all right I think we got it and
I will say I once saw a monkey at a zoo
try to repair a television set and it
was doing a significantly better job
than you are at the whatever it is that
you're trying to do
Emma stop evidence
yeah it's delicious I am very
disappointed in you the instructions
clearly stay to combine banana through
oats which means you start a banana and
you go down the list of ingredients
adding everything in until you get to
yolks so that seems self-explanatory I
don't know why you would see a list of
ingredients and assume that they don't
have a place in the recipe so that was
surprising
um and then what else you made Giant
divots and in your cookie well you only
made four cookies
four big cookies which instead of 12.
do you want like seven Honda Civics or
four Lamborghinis so
I mean honestly really are you
destroying Arc because you hate why
don't you just try one of the cookies
chef and see which one tastes good and
which one tastes terrible yes you can
it says you
can try this God they're so moist
[Music]
and juicy and vanilla
um
try it it's great best cookie you'll
ever have
so awful
oh it's so salty
I just want you to taste this and see
what you've done
oh fudge muffins
who the fudge made these fudging things
ew it's terrible fudge
thank you so much for making this
amazing recipe book the book of recipes
okay for sale on our website so if you
like me having more Lamborghinis please
buy a recipe book we have many of them
all kinds of delicious ideas
TBH the whole thing took like if I
wasn't
mentally unwell it would take like two
minutes to make so it's awesome
and uh as far as who won the challenge I
think on taste texture appearance
and generally being a good cookie kids
one for sure
yes yes all your dress desserts thank
you so much guys thank you so much when
you grow up this video will be either
much more funny or much less funny
depending on which way your life sigs
and zags I'll see you guys next time
foreign
