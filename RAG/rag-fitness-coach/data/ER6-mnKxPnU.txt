this meeting is now damn i got it wrong
it's not nasty whatever it's the q a dr
james still getting used to this new
zoom shit
dr mike how's it going good um
zoom now notifies us when we're being
recorded with a pleasant yet robotic
female voice
i guess that's because that one cnn guy
was uh tugging at the old windpipe
that's right meat flute i wish you could
change the voice like you know how in
like ways you can like have like an
australian guy like oh you fucking cut
meat and starting oh fucking meat in you
put that wank meat away all right
folks we're here to answer your
questions the youtube sorting algorithm
did not help dr mike or i today we
struggled before the show started
but we'll get through it the top
comments are like the top five comments
have zero likes
according to who how the fuck does this
thing work
so bear with us if we're searching
around a little bit today
oh let us begin so our first
commenter questioner is
oh james just go go to find because this
shit is not so
i already got it open i'm ready okay
n-e-c-u
nekoo oh oh
yeah word up
whatever that means coco serbian or
something
okay all right
boom in parentheses according to science
makuu asks is it really true that a 33
calorie surplus
kcal surplus daily is enough to build
slash maximize muscle growth or do we
really need 250 cals
daily from one to two pounds of muscle
gain per month how far can we build
strength if we are
monthly gaining least amounts of muscle
mass since neurological adaptation is
what majority of strength training is
about
so is it really true of 33 kcal surplus
daily is enough to build
maximize muscle growth probably probably
very close to that
um do we need 250k cals per day extra
no however james and i have harped about
this for a very long time you actually
can't
generate a 33k cal surplus
just like you can't take a needle out
and hit
one part of an atom and not the other
part because you don't have that level
of precision you have no idea how's
going on
if you think you're safe at warp you're
wrong as a direct quote from star trek
and if you think you can track to less
than 50 calories a day you're wrong and
here's why
as a few folks in the uh fitness
evidence-based community have noted
food portion sizes are usually off by
dependably around five to twenty percent
even if it's five percent five percent
of a 2000 calorie diet is
100 calories a day right if my math is
right
you're already off by that it's like you
don't know if you're off by that so
here's a scenario for you
you think your your maintenance is 2 000
kcals a day
first of all you don't even know if that
could be anywhere between 1900 and 2100
you would know again otherwise
and you go okay i need to eat 2033 kcals
per day
and you quote unquote do that you have
no
idea if you're doing it or not you can
write it down on a piece of paper
and then for one month they've done some
kind of weird you know metabolic
um radioactive racer study on you and
they're like good news bad news
you were actually hypocaloric almost
every day this month
and you lost two pounds of fat and
gained almost no muscle
it'd be like a pork but i was over by 33
calories and they're like you
don't have the precision to detect that
what you need to do
is make an effort
to have a non
have a distinct definite surplus that is
like
at the very least for her surplus of
some kind and
roughly 250 kcals per day is maybe it's
150
maybe it's 250 something like 200 is the
lowest
james and i as fitness professionals
would dependably think someone could
actually hit so do you need to go 500
kcals per day or a thousand over no of
course not
but 33 is some old bullshit that anyone
who says they're doing it
doesn't have the precision to actually
conclude james
yeah 100 love the star trek joke in
there by the way um yeah so we use that
250 because we know that
250 is going to move the needle in the
right direction right that's really the
only reason where it's like anything
less than that it's kind of
and not so mike mentioned like uh
portion sizing tends to have measurement
error but not to mention like your
actual devices like even if you're using
a food scale that has its own
measurement error built in as well and
it gets
multiplied throughout the day every time
you eat another meal that you use it now
generally you'd say like on average the
errors kind of
wax and wane in both directions but you
know it's going to be off consistently
in some way
um so i got another one real quick oh
yeah do it daily activity
oh yeah can you imagine you're at like
you're in high school you're trying to
gain weight and you're dancing with the
girl of your dreams and you're like
oh okay i gotta go sit down she's like
why are like i'm over my daily
steps like what okay like yeah
and i walked by the aisles the apple
aisle the grocery store you have to walk
back that's 33 fucking calories right
there man walking across the store
yeah and my my step counter is on my
wank hand so it gets thrown off
depending on how much i wank right like
at that point
yeah burn calories though it's like dude
20
000 steps you're the man i'm like for
sure i'm morally pathetic
i can eat a lot more um
nope just need just need more gatorade
at that point but yeah so 250 is just
gonna
for sure get you going in the right
direction could you be gaining muscle we
had a lot less than that
sure could you be gaining muscle with
even more than that yes
uh but you might not need to so it's
kind of one of those things um
when you are consistent with the things
that you eat day to day like i'm not
saying uh
you always eat the exact same things but
most people like they're doing this kind
of
diet life stuff you kind of have the
same you like you have your chicken you
have your
either your bagels or whatever carbs
like to use like rice so
if you're having those generally the
same foods every day it's easier and
easier to kind of get to
that level of precision in which you
might not have to go as
high you know like okay if i always eat
50 grams of rice maybe i can
increase it to whatever um but yeah if
you're
if you're starting off and you're having
a hard time gaining and you're not
pushing it up to like 250 that might be
time to think about increasing your cows
a little bit
yeah we could see a very related
question not by necro himself but
someone else is like
i'm gaining i've got a 33 calorie
surplus but i'm not gaining what gave
some james i would roll our eyes
completely around 360 in our hands
totally all right up next is
a gentleman named only sam
the youtube account
oh i got you my name's sam sam i am and
i
i always think of like lord of the rings
sam
sam wise sam wise i always
go down a spiral too because then i
think of when that that
actor who who played sam he was also on
an episode of svu where he was like the
creepy camp counselor guy
yeah it's rock when you can't unsee the
character
totally or uh if it's um forgot what his
name
is is one of my favorite they're my
favorite actors i'm not named
it's the guy who played general zod and
superman i will find him
oh yeah i will find him that guy's the
fucking man and then everything he
touches is pure gold
but i can't unsee him as zod so he's in
the movie where he's in afghanistan
shooting people i'm like you just use
your zod powers to do motherfucker what
are you using guns for
yes or uh now with the what's it josh
brolin like you can't unsee
thanos right like just stand outside
it's pretty much thanos in real life
anyway
yeah um dude do you remember the do you
remember that superman movie relatively
well
yeah i remember what i really liked um
that's
that particular scene had kind of like
that star trek
con esque where it's like so intense
it's such a small part of the movie it's
like you know just a blip in terms of
the movie but it's like so
vivid and intense you just you you
totally can empathize with the person
even though he's the bad guy
i would uh if i was one of the guys
sentencing like we're better kill that
guy because if he gets out he seems very
upset he seems yeah
he's also a bad motherfucker for sure
dude remember that one chick that was
like
fighting elliot from svu and she's all
like a good death is its own reward
or whatever oh yes that bitch dude if i
was him i'd be like yo
girl and talk about that let's talk
about life let's talk about you and your
fucking
body and your oh you know what i'm
saying we can make interplanetary love
right here right now we could be the
first
i can't believe superman hit it already
i can't believe we both
like made an svu reference across
those examples yeah how did we how did
we converge on svu as like a common
thread
happened to be an yeah that's a weird
coincidence
in any case um sam
sorry to delay your question so much
when when milo does the uh the show
notes for this he's gonna be like
three minutes six minutes mike and james
talk about star
crack and superman and that one girl
who's super hot that apparently mike
wants to paint
like i just want to show her that on
earth we don't have just violence we
have love
yeah it'd be sweet if you both could get
sunshine powers and then like
you know super bang
1 000 right like what would that be like
just new universes being created from
all the energy
yo at least you'd have smoke a fat
cigarette after that one
extra lot of nothing you know when that
shit when the sex is so good you got
nothing to say
you just both sit there and you're like
yeah
yeah or sometimes i'll be like i'm gonna
go work out or do something else just
like
i took a lot of pre-workouts this is
exactly this was
a warm-up stuff or actually more
accurately james for you'd be like you
want to do this again she's like yeah
like right now she's like what that
actually does come up a lot where i'm
like you want to do it again and i was
like get out of here you freaking
yeah yeah sam apologies again
he says in your video slash interview
mike
on dieting for endurance versus strength
slash hyper reverses health you say
essentially the total eating volume
per se is
somewhat negative for health longevity
uh for stress on the cells or something
in fact yes
the more you eat the less long you live
my question is does this simply
this implied people with slower
metabolisms i.e with relatively lower
maintenance calories proportional to
body size or the like have an advantage
with regards to health longevity yeah
and assuming the accordingly you don't
get fat and health complications yes
yeah 100
you know 100 of the slowest metabolisms
you can ever monitor is like that of a
turtle
um they live goddamn forever for some
shit there's like turtles as
old as ben franklin and shit you're like
they asked you know who ben franklin was
and what he was like he was like i don't
know
what is fun yeah i mean there's probably
some sweet spot there because like if
you are if you are a slow
burner so to speak you probably
maybe might not live the like most
rigorous lifestyle either so there's
health you know complications of just
being less active things like that
there's probably some middle ground
where
maybe you don't need to eat a ton but
you're still living like a a physically
active lifestyle
it's physically active life but not one
in which you're the optimal health and
longevity comes from
a decent amount of physical activity but
if you're training for ultra marathons
and shit you're already going to live
less long and you're burning fear it's
going too fast which goes uh
it's it's a thing but then again it's
quality of life versus longevity
like the the best way to live a long
time is to essentially be a monk
but like you know being a mom let's talk
about the downsides
no porn and at that point i'm out yeah
no i mean at the end hard stop done
okay yeah i wanted to go this retreat
you guys have porn they're like no i'm
like oh
nice you got to get like your your monk
vpn
so you can watch porn secretly but
you're basically not a monk at that
point
no they do that no i love meditation i'm
zen and shit i just need
you know fucked up or porn
porn fuck or fuck videos or
fuckvideos.gov
that's the last thing we want is like
government subsidized pornography
that would be awful it'd be awful it
would just be all consenting
the whole time
james next up in our list is
let me make sure i get this ready oh
it's vasil
vasil relia
remember how to spell the seal right oh
i do
got it
is in russian it translates roughly to
to have sympathy for someone or pity
is it sympathy or pity that's kind of is
it is it which one
it's context dependent but um it's to
spare someone like spare someone's life
um um i i pity him but kind of
in not necessarily an insulting way kind
of a respectful but like oh man like
like someone broke their leg before the
olympics like oh man
like i really just unfortunate like
really sympathizing
really sucks more sympathy less less mr
t
more sympathetic less mr t for sure but
but you can put a sarcastic spin on it
and put it in real nasty
every every russian thing can be start
sarcasticized
beyond sort of true all right
so vegetal says uh asks rather when
performing an inclined dumbbell fly is
it bad if the arm goes beyond parallel
in the bottom correct position does the
answer change if the chest is flared and
the shoulder blades are tucked i'm
asking because a friend of mine is
asking me for my giant ring moment
honestly tortures me greatly if you do
not feel that your joints are being
compromised if your fork production is
not
released uh like in a big way where like
really low you feel great and below that
you're like oh shit i can't even lift a
half this weight
if you don't have pain in the shoulder
joint or any of the joints around
uh and if it's just killing your muscles
then there's not a goddamn thing wrong
with
any way of moving that meets that
criteria james can you just fucking
sneeze already this is rude
i was killing me sorry it's killing me
no actually it's trippy when people hold
on sneezes
remember once i was in class when i was
an undergrad and this girl would hold in
her sneezes completely
but like you could clearly tell the you
know like inter thoracic pressure was
insane
it should be like you're like are you
gonna blow up next time you just fucking
see me
your ears and eyes are bleeding
she's like she turns red passes out
you're like i'm pretty sure that girl's
dead
don't do that what's wrong with you god
i don't even cover my sneezing i don't
like that
oh you ever seen those girl in front of
me rubbing her like snot off the back of
her hand i'm like
you've ever seen those like super
slow-mo videos of people sneezing oh
that's gross really just all that
stuff huh i'm a mouth sneezer too like i
never comes out my nose like it always
like
comes out my mouth you ever have to i
know this is this dude i always get into
this
where are the two grossest people alive
i'm just honest
um do you ever sneeze while you're
eating like rice or something
oh all sorts of shit comes out dude
and it gets locked up in there for like
half a day the rest of the day you're
still blowing
your nose and there's like grains coming
out oh i've gotten
ramen up my nose from doing that it's
you know spicy and it's just oh
fucking awful yeah no sinuses
all right next up is wilson
man real quick too uh
vasil sorry i'm sorry yeah yeah with
those dumbbell flies
i actually think that's an advantage of
doing the incline dumbbell fly i don't
know if you're like me but like i have
like kind of big
scaps like the bones are big so like
when i do flat dumbbell flies it's good
movement for me
but that very bottom position is just
kind of weird because
just hard to get all the way into like a
really good stretch position on the pad
whereas the incline for a lot of people
it just opens you up in a way that is
hard to hit in
some other positions so as mike said if
you can do it pain-free and you really
feel like a deep stretch in the muscle
and you get good soreness and good
performance improvements you just keep
doing what you're doing and i think
that's actually an advantage for doing
the incline fly versus the flat fly
where
sometimes in that very bottom position
for some people not all uh
can be just awkward to get a good
stretch if you don't have a good
good uh pads set up like if the pad's
too wide or too narrow it can be a
little goofy
so definitely do it
what was that sorry uh wilson wilson man
got it miss so i think we answered
henrik's question last time but let's
see if i don't remember what the fuck it
was
thinking at piggybacking off of uh the
answer to a hendrix question
if fast twitch fibers recover slower
between mini sets
in a mile web types that we do and doing
my reps on different exercises would be
a decent diagnostic for seeing which of
your muscles
are more slow or fast which dominant
maybe but there's so much else going on
so the same muscle can be more slow
twitch fast which dominant but it can be
better or
more poorly vascularized for example it
can be leveraged in such a way that
allows us to have a high degree of
endurance
there's like 10 trillion other things
that are going on like
faster and slower fiber types are
interesting theoretically they're
interesting to talk about eventually we
have really good diagnostic for them
it'll be something you can really take
home but for now
we just say like look it's it's mostly
mixed anyway it's all a mixed bag
put your muscles hard if you're getting
good soreness good pumps good local
fatigue drop off
then the rep ranges are going to guide
themselves to the best sfrs anyway i
just wouldn't worry a ton about slower
or faster types
put you this way if you're doing sets of
eight in a stiff legged deadlift your
hams are fucked
for four days they're super sore they
get crazy pumped you can barely limp out
of the gym and you're making crazy gains
on them
and then they do a biopsy and they
realize your hamstrings are all slow
twitch but you've done sets of 30 and
like curls and they don't do dick for
you what are you going to do change your
brain
to find something that like yes exactly
so you kind of already it's kind of like
you already know
i'll put you this way um here's a really
crude analogy
we know that folks of west african
descent on average tend to be faster
short distance sprinklers than everybody
else
does that mean like you're going to
recruit sprinters by looking at how dark
their skin is how broad their nose is no
you're going to be like hey line up and
motherfucker and whoever's fast just
take them you'll end up with more west
africans but
it's just easier to test printing speed
than kind of big proxy measure of like
well what it is
and what about genetics for sprint speed
like just fucking run
strain whatever gives you a pump a lot
of disruption a lot of soreness that's
probably your best bet as to what's
going to grow you
yeah and i'm really glad you brought
that up too because i think a lot of
people get too focused on this like fast
twitch slow twitch issue when reality is
it's like it's more of the sfr issue
right
what is actual what exercises rep ranges
cadence you know intensification
techniques get you
into those better sfr ranges and i mean
you can do a couple different things if
you're really curious like just just
for you know masturbatory purposes like
okay you know curious for aspiratory
purposes
yeah so so like the sfr is the obvious
one like okay do you
is your best pumps and soreness in the
five to ten range okay that's probably a
good sign
do you feel massive fatigue drop off
like comparatively with other muscles
like you do two sets and you're like i'm
fucking done
on this one that's maybe a good
indicator does the weight on the bar
tend to increase
basically every week or does it take
bigger jumps you know than other muscles
yeah that's probably a good sign but
like mike said it's a mixed bag anyway
and you're going to use the same methods
of trying to figure out that sfr
either way so it's not worth it's
usually one of these things like if your
flash twitch or slow twitch dominant in
any way
you know already because all of your
life's activities have gravitated to
what you're good at so if you've always
been strong
you're probably more fast switch down
and if you used to do cross-country
you're probably more slow twitch
dominant yeah
oh by the way that uh question by sam we
answered the wrong one so let's just
answer the right one now
oh i was wondering i was like that
question didn't have any right there i
was like
i remember that it was different and i
was like maybe i was just missed it
same thing when people tend to have
higher rates of muscle growth than
shorter limbed people
uh not that's not the immediate
assumption you would make
now longer than people generally on
average tend to have an easier time
stimulating growth
because they can traverse such huge like
they just don't need to do as many reps
because each one of the reps is more
mechanical work so um
it is always funny to say when longer
than people say like man i can't get my
quads to grow like your quads have been
growing for years
you're just so lanky that it doesn't
look like much yet but you keep going
and they're going to be enormous
shorter than people fill out quicker so
it looks like they green muscle up
faster but the reality they're gaining
probably the same amount of muscle maybe
even less
it's just a fitting on a shorter frame
so um i just will say shorter people
sometimes struggle to present a really
good raw stimulus magnitude
because the ranges of motion are so
short especially using a lot of machines
that aren't designed for them
to all people for the most part like if
you're tall
you have decent genetics stimulus is not
going to be a problem eating enough
consistently to get bigger is going to
be a problem
you know like james you ever see like
the tall guy effect on metabolism
uh from surface area and from just their
body weight like
like our friend al like you know eats an
inordinate amount of food it just stays
160 pounds like i've actually masked him
up to over 200.
look heaven and earth 7 000 calories a
day
day in and day out of vain and it's just
sometimes really hard for all guys to
gain weight and it's just not hard for
them to stimulate the muscle to kind of
um yeah totally i think like kind of
some of the old-school thought on um
the limb length too is that like
sometimes not always but sometimes uh
people who have
shorter limbs have a more of a
mechanical advantage on certain lifts
which allows them to lift more weights
and then the thought is like
if they can lift more weights does that
translate into more muscle growth
and the answer is like maybe but not
always so it's like
the muscle growth uh proclivity of an
individual is
largely independent of the limb length
and the anthropometry at least
from from the best that we can tell now
but maybe there are some
trends in that but i certainly don't see
that i think
more often than not they're just two
independent factors because there's
plenty of short people who
aren't super strong or aren't super
jacked you know what i mean but like
mike said sometimes it looks like they
fill out more
or this or that so it's it's not
necessarily like a tit for tat like okay
you have
stumpy arms that means you can bench
press a lot which means you're going to
be
you'll have a huge chest maybe but maybe
not also
by the way our next contestant next
question asker
is e i n and
uh what's his last name
on iron brown
yeah i'm brown perfect and
he reminds me because of the similar
last name and it's germanic sounding
of um what is her name ava
ava braun uh oh adolf hitler's wife
and uh just always whenever i see ein
brown's name i'm always like yes will be
a new germany was a newbie
it's terrible but my sister yeah i
always think of the dog from
from bebop who was named ein oh there
you go
that's like one of those funny names for
somebody's like i need like a german
word what's the word in german there's
google search and it's like ein and
they're like all right
um i um
i watched that anime at the wrong time
of my life
i think i was 15 years old and the only
thing i got out of it was that one that
was big enough
she had big ass titties that's not one
for you i know you that's more of like
more of like a
kind of an artsy fartsy one that's not
up your alley i don't think you would
enjoy it and i like the space cowboy
idea a lot
but i recently like rewatched the entire
thing and i
i don't think it's for you that's okay
it's not for everybody
doug was describing how amazing the uh
saga firefly was oh unbelievable it got
canceled after one season i was like wow
way to sell it doug and he's like that's
not what i meant
yeah it's a car classic coach tim would
fucking go off about that all the time
because there was a movie too that it
was like i forgot but yeah
coach tim was all about firefly i liked
the space cowboy shit really appeals to
me i kind of want to live on that one
it is cool but like a lot of the show is
filled with like just awkward scenes
and like jazz music yeah as
like i was i'm imagining like as soon as
the jazz music which is basically like
every episode it hits you mike's like
nah i'm out of here fuck this
what is this where's the cowboys in big
titties
i'm brown says help with mesocycle
backsliding what should i
change if my progress keeps resetting
itself after a deload seven days off
from
training this only affects one exercise
my adaptations are retained for
everything else
he you know that's kind of a mystery um
[Music]
would say try two things one training
significantly harder
during the mesocycle and two
try to still train during the deload not
seven days off from painting
but keep some of the neural patterning
by doing two light days through that
time
just for technique and then see if it's
a nervous system issue
and maybe that could resolve itself but
to be completely honest this is one of
the uh
one of these things that tends to stump
me when people say they backslide after
a deload and get weaker
um it's the number one unfortunate
number one hypothesis about that is your
body just really not interested in
making or keeping out of bacons
and you're not really progressing much
and
would go back to basics go back to the
troubleshooting videos that we have on
the channel
if you're hitting all those but other
than that it's just a corrupt thing
i'm also wondering too like he says
backsliding which like
you and i think of like a regression but
i'm wondering too if it's like is your
performance basically
stable you know because within like
within
using the rir scale like your
performance might be stable but you're
doing
you know you kept the weight the same as
what you ended at last time but now
you're starting at three or four rir
so it kind of looks like you're
backsliding but in reality is like
you're actually kind of exactly where
you were you're just using a heavier
weight and lower or excuse me higher rar
you know could be that too well and then
it's one of those okay so let's say he's
not backsliding let's say he's just not
getting better
that's also a fucking problem you know
yeah and then where do you go where do
you go with that i don't know
um do better
it's it's always odd too when it's just
one particular movement or exercise like
if
everything else is good which that means
you're fundamentally because it's a
nervous system thing
yeah some people need more practice with
the movements
i have a movement like that actually
hilariously it's the dumbbell lateral
raise
if i don't do it like twice a week
and i come back to it it feels so
foreign and weird
i'm like oh i suck but even if i do it
really light every few days
i can go ultra heavy every couple of
those days and just hit pr after pr
after pr because it feels groovy
um you know nervous system thrives on
repetition and high frequency
remember like the west side guys you
squat like once a week what the fuck are
you guys doing
yeah they could they just to them they
had to go so heavy they couldn't recover
any sooner but
you know i would say try not to take
seven days off from training
yeah i'm trying to think of any other
recommendation that one's good um
i'd be curious to know if it's like a
movement that's consistently in your
program or if it's one that you kind of
come on and off
that's like because then you have like
the low bar squat phenomenon which is
like what dr mike is also talking about
um yeah i'm not sure yeah i'm not sure
sounds like everything else is going
pretty good except for this one
particular movement
and and frankly like if ultimately even
if
if you're backsliding or even if you're
just not making any progress it sounds
like that movement might be shit for you
anyway so maybe maybe just think of
swapping it out for a higher sfr
movement
totally one you can make progress on
yeah and uh you know we're all
always another great uh way to fix this
would be
a strong and unified germany
i mean how can you make progress on your
bench if your
germany is not strong and unified you
gotta get your priorities straight
good god we're talking about exercise
of the body we need to exercise the will
of a people
this this is going downhill fast this is
what james and i do when we just hang
out as friends it's just
tangents just tornado down into nonsense
just nonsense tangents 100 all right
speaking of nonsense our next
question asker's name is terrac
which is e e r r and let's see where
that makes us
get out of here get out of here zoom
controls
got it what the fuck is his
avatar flopping card
i can't tell i'm looking at the one
below the clasquianna
and that's like a super fat person it
looks like and the avatars are tough for
me because if it's sufficiently
like detailed image i'm like i don't
know it's too small
you know oh yeah
all right cool okay this is a fun one so
there we go
how long should a pump last do pumps
tend to go away more quickly after
training different muscle groups in the
same session
example quads at the start of a second
shoulder towards the end yes
pumps will so there's there's a lot of
blood and fluid volume and you only have
so much of both
and if you get something else pumped
after you have some you know one thing
pumped
the pump in that first thing tends to go
away to some extent is that a bad thing
it may actually be a bad thing because
then that's one of the ways the
interference effect probably expresses
itself
the ideal thing to do after training a
muscle is to leave it the fuck alone
does that mean you need to be training
one muscle at a time if you were you're
super super
searching for optimality and you could
train two or three times every day yeah
this would probably probably be your
best bet
um how long should a pump last uh
depends on what you mean by pump and
like where your cutoff point is if it's
no longer pumped anymore
i would say that there's also difference
between fat loss phase
and mass phase and maintenance phase
generally longer pump lasts
the more indicative of the robust
stimulus that you got
sometimes it can mean that you did so
much damage is probably too much
if you're still pumped like nine hours
later you're gonna be sore
fuck there's like pieces of your muscle
floating around in there
that's why you're pumped uh it's like
literally edema from injury
but i would say typically you know pumps
last for anywhere between
15 to 20 minutes to several hours after
training in my experience uh you know to
a
less and less a small extent or much
more event
um and i think during fat loss phases
they may last as little as 15 or 20
minutes even less and then it's not
great but
what it is and sometimes they may last
for quite a long time several hours
afterwards
and that's a good sign that you're
probably doing a lot right and maybe a
sign you're doing too much
so i would say that as long as you
achieve a really big pump
during the session like right after
within the next five minutes when you go
to the locker room to take your pictures
that's the real like gold standard how
long it lasts afterwards
you know there's going to be a lot of
variables that affect and ideally it
lasts as long as possible
um without you completely fucking
yourself up and
doing you know absolutely crazy shit and
getting too sore but now that that's the
that's the thought on that yeah really
good and uh fun exercise physiology fact
folks for those of you
who haven't studied it um when you start
exercising a muscle
you actually start getting preferential
blood flow
to and leaving from that muscle so your
body will actively start constricting to
other areas
and actually dilating the vasculature
going to the one that's being worked
so there is sort of a time series effect
there so as you start warming
up they're kind of initiating some of
those cardiac functions that are pumping
more blood to that muscle
there's also what we call reactive
hyperemia which is when you start
contracting hard
you start building up some metabolites
and that stimulates another vasodilation
effect once the metabolites are released
so you get like a big pump from every
set that you do um
and so what's kind of interesting about
that is you have this kind of like time
series effect of
pump as a result of exercise and like
mike said if you switch
to doing something else you have set in
motion all of these things that are
saying like
pump blood to the legs the legs are
working really hard right now
and then maybe you switch to something
like a shoulder or an arm
and now your body's recalibrating and
saying well we had all the flow going
through the legs now we're actually
going to constrict a little bit
in that direction because the metabolic
demand is now in the arms we got to
redirect things
more towards the arms less towards the
legs and so as he said it's kind of an
interesting conundrum
when you train multiple muscle groups
per day so there's you know the the most
hilarious and optimal way would be as
mike said to like just train
quads take a break come back train
hamstrings take a break come back to
train calves
but it's so wildly impractical and like
what what is
the magnitude of that effect we don't
really know so most people train
multiple muscle groups within a session
but yeah
it does mean that you sacrifice some of
the pump effect
all right next up is
our dear friend henrik anderson who is
probably as
close to a resident on this uh webcast
as we can have because basically he gets
reloaded so much all the fucking time
he's consistently delivers good
questions and uploaded questions
i think you had a video on your
recommendations that we are the weakest
generation of all time
it's all about that channel called the
warrior poets society
i want to be like you know what's the
symptom of that weakness poetry
are you eating hard you oppose the fuck
up out of my face ryan
i'm choking you to my like algorithm's
all fucked up because it's always like a
just a cacophony of unrelated things so
it's just like here
this are you a man do you like guns and
car
beer here's a bunch of shit us bunnies
greg knuckles
is like pretty squarely on the political
left and because of his friends and his
involvement in powerlifting
facebook assumes these are like uh
republicans like the right person like
ben shapiro shit he's like
it's so awful like facebook assumes i'm
many things that i'm not but it's not
that far off for me
it does give me a ton of mansion like
hey you shave right
you like kodiak bears and bitches with
tits and mistakes
imagine a bear throwing a snake at a
bitch with titties and her shaving i'm
like i don't even know what's going on
i get a lot of those like man targeted
things
whatever henrik anderson
asks as someone that doesn't need to go
to local mrvs due to training
how do i know when to deload if i go
until i can't physically progress
anymore
i'm so systemically fatigued that i'm
facing several consequences such as
sleep disruptions for one to two weeks
before performance drops when should i
deal it easy
when you start to get a stomach deload
or some systemic fatigue effect that
starts to really bother you
well just fucking stop then so if you
have like
your appetites down you feel really
flustered you're clearly fatigued and
sore as fuck
and also your sleep is starting to get
wonky for a few nights in a row next
week starts to load
that yeah absolutely and i mean they
kind of answered your own question there
right where it's like
when you start manifesting symptoms of
systemic fatigue
that's not a bad spot ideally you
might be very dialed in and know
exactly when they tend to start
manifesting so it might be something
like
four you know week four i'm mostly good
week five if i go to a fifth week in my
meso i start to get kind of
janky and then you say okay well from
now on i finish week four
deload on that fifth week and then i
just never quite get there and i'm
always
maybe you're leaving a little bit of
time training on the table
but at the same time your performances
will be really good and you'll feel like
really
prepared for all of your training
sessions so that's awesome
um all right next up is almost lorenzo
llamas i
really look forward to the day that he
asked a question on this but it's
lorenzo
or do you think anyone ever is like
like somebody who knows lorenzo like his
manager's like yo you get a lot of shout
outs on this this
exercise q and a shit you go on this
stupid webinar thing
[Laughter]
all right lorenzo asks hey docs i
noticed that dr mike is regularly doing
super rom laterals with dumbbells
i just wanted to know if these can be a
viable replacement professional number
raise
and what cues leading with pinkies how
high should we go et cetera can you give
us when we want to try this particular
movement yeah it's easy
absolutely i wouldn't i wouldn't talk
about uh replacements i would talk about
variations it's something you can do
like rice doesn't replace pasta but
something you can have instead of pasta
every now and again
and uh i would say that you can have
your pinkies wherever comfortable
i wouldn't have your thumbs pointing
straight up because that makes it a
little bit more front down movement
i would say neutral pinky's up is okay
sometimes it bothering shoulders
but you know arm's relatively straight
and go up uh you know until you're at
least
past this sort of 45 degree angle from
here to here you generate almost no
force
some people like to go all that high
because it gives them a nice little rest
and reset point so you can
essentially kind of doing my reps
because here you get a little break when
you go back down here you
actually get a little few more reps each
set so that's kind of cool
um and if you're doing this for sport or
something like jiu jitsu wrestling
or tennis i would actually go all the
way up and down because it improves your
mobility a ton it's just really good for
you
um the way i started doing these is i i
was doing regular laterals and then
doing another exercise altogether
i had a bit of a shoulder injury and i
was like fuck i can't even fucking do
laterals anymore
and then i was just fucking around in
the gym seeing like you guys know like
after you get hurt the game's apparently
done before
you try to like see which way you can
move that hurts and which way doesn't
and you're like
how can i train around this and all of a
sudden i just i kept going up with
really light dumbbells and i was like
wait a minute this feels incredible what
the fuck so
um to me it felt really good i would
just say your number one guide
is are you feeling a pump and tension in
the side belts and a burn
and also are your joints feeling okay
and the pinky stuff and angle and all
that other shit
that's just gonna take care of the rest
just make sure to lift with your
shoulders and not heave pull it so don't
go
like that and get the dumbbells off and
so basically you want to get them up
under your own strength your side belts
when you're coming back down make sure
to milk that eccentric
it's a real nasty thing fuck you so hard
in the best way possible
because riding that eccentric down
when you do regular laterals the
centric's not that bad because after the
first half of the movement is basically
zero
riding the centric down through the
whole thing is awful
it takes like two whole seconds and it's
a ton of hypertrophic stimulus i would
say ride the eccentric down and you can
use
the hands or the 15s and just get pump
of your life
uh give it a shot and remember it's not
magic if you hate the exercise if it
hurts your shoulder it's not fucking
doing
really really good yeah and if you if
you are like a long-armed person like
myself that is a
very humbling movement because you are
feeling it all the way to the top and
you're going to be using the fucking
like
tense what's that you probably the super
arm laterals oh yeah i've done it i
i kind of uh petered out on them after a
while so
i've swapped them out for something else
but uh no they're
brutal and it's one of those where it's
like um if you're if you have long arms
like
you can have like three to four weight
increments with no difference in
repetitions because it's just so
fucking awful uh so you can like you're
using the 20s you're like ooh 20s is too
heavy i can only get like you know 10
reps you go down to like
15 you're like i still only got 10 reps
you go down to like 10 you're like 10
reps this sucks fuck
um and one word of word to uh of caution
if you don't do a lot of stuff that's
kind of like overhead in that like last
half of the movement like if you haven't
done any like dumbbell pressing or
anything like that
i have overreached on that from going
too aggressive a couple times
where uh my delts are used to doing like
the lateral part but they really weren't
used to doing that last half and you do
like four
maybe four sets or something and then
the next day you're totally fucked
because it was so
novel so just be cautious yeah i would
ease into those they're just
for a side delt movement they have such
a great
raw stimulus magnitude then it's two
things
incredibly refreshing to be like oh my
god i can fucking zap these
high adults are hard to hit a lot of
times you do a bunch of sets of whatever
seated laterals you're like you don't
even know if you're
training yeah you do like one set of
super arm laterals you're like
oh my god yeah but also that really can
throw you off because it's such an
unusual movement you've got to really
release
it it typically is a good sfr movement
for the shoulders too
of course it's always an individual
thing but just in this case the range of
motion is so high
the amount of load that you can actually
use is just relatively low so like a
centric ride is amazing
yeah you can't really like fuck yourself
up too bad outside of like just
not uh progressing your sets
appropriately yeah
yep all right
ibrahim albu abu sabha
that's a tough one nicely done the
double pump a all right
during low fat high carb mass phase at
what point do you believe the body might
upregulate de novo lipogenesis a study
show
it is relatively subdued in normal
conditions is there a minimum fat
threshold or maximum carbohydrate
threshold
beyond which the body might begin to
increase you know lipogenesis obviously
based on your body weight and daily
expenditure
so anytime you're in a caloric surplus
dinovo lipogenesis tends to occur
so if you're you can do plenty of
general epigenesis
if you are actually eating very low fats
and you're hypochloric it'll turn some
uh fats into or some carbs into fats yes
it's a thing that happens it just
doesn't uh happen as easily as taking
fats you're already eating and pouring
them in
and so that's one of those very very
small theoretical advantages of high
carb low fat
you know it's one of the things that on
the other side of spectrum
people like keto people say like eat
back to burn fat like yeah you stupid
motherfucker you're burning the fat that
you eat
not your own body fat so uh you know
just the same way you don't want to
think
high carb low fat mass and be like you
can't gain fat like this like if you can
because the extra carbs will make you
put on fat so it's it's really a thing
it doesn't happen as efficiently so it's
a small advantage there
yeah and i i don't know of any um sort
of thresholds or intakes but you know
just speaking theoretically i would
imagine that this
becomes more of a thing once your like
liver glycogen and muscle glycogen
is relatively full meaning like you
might be very soon
yeah and so if you if you have
relatively full glycogen stores and your
blood glucose is normal and then you're
getting like big
dumps of carbohydrate that's probably
the instance where you're going to start
seeing more and more fat accumulation
regardless of what you eat
all right next up james is our final
question asker
all right i just saw a recommendation i
have
change your brain neuroscientist dr
andrew something rather
and the thing and the the thing uh the
video thumbnail says
your behavior sweet get those
no what are those called no tropics or
whatever yeah neutral effects i'm gonna
as far as happening affecting my
behavior means i like
plug microsoft goss get into like
my brain and then like run a fucking
search function
while like early 90s techno plays and
like a girl in a miniskirt is around
like in all the hacking movies god damn
that just that really set me back for a
minute
i just thought about like i was thinking
about like entering the code for the
family feud
dos game back in the day fuck
that's wow set me back back with a dog
how far have computers come as far as um
as as far as ui ux like as far as user
interfacing
it's like right now since year old can
use a fucking ipad can you imagine
putting a three-year-old up to ms-dos
but like
all right enter the director you want to
access to turn this video game on
motherfuckers
we had discs that you had to put into a
drive and sometimes you had to flip them
the other direction remember those bad
boys
amazing i liked it when the operating
system was in
in disc form so you have to load that
before you get anything else
incredible god windows didn't come stock
on your machine
your machine came with only like the
assembly program and then you would have
to load in the cds of 10 cds to load
microsoft oh
yes computer i was just thinking like
when the zip drives came out and it was
like you can now store like a megabyte
on this disk and now it's just like 100
megabytes like fucking god that's so
many gifs of
porn yeah now it's just like you have
like unlimited cloud storage to just it
just magically goes somewhere
before you had to have this giant disc
read the movie creed with um michael b
jordan
yeah yeah yeah he like uh so that's just
a moment
he writes him a training plan on a piece
of paper and he's like thanks he takes a
picture of it he gives him the paperback
he's like
don't you need this he's like that's in
the cloud he goes
what what he what's up that was so good
it's true too it's hard to explain that
kind of stuff to somebody who didn't
like grow up
in it yeah yeah all right
ibrahim asks oh no he already did sorry
we're on to the next guy
right or was he
wait what yeah exactly james
e-i-n-h-e-r
i think that'll happen yeah this is a
man who
desperately needs a viking sword to make
sense of his life
yeah no kidding you were you were
destined to have long flowing hair into
the viking mist
to slaughter neanderthals or whatever
the fuck your ancestors were doing
what were my ancestors doing yeah we
were like in like southern europe
bartering and giving out loans i don't
know 2 there's a lot of interest
[Laughter]
james your ancestors were alcoholics
somewhere in germany
like yeah somewhere i picked up some
japanese
um depending on what day of the week i
checked my 23andme it's like you're
japanese no you're not
yeah you're german no you're not they
don't know what the fuck i'm like
broadly
eastern european and irish yeah they
they know you're a weeb
so they fuck with you by being like
japanese and you're like oh my god
yes got my naruto headband on that's
right
here we're hearing i wasn't always into
japanese
i found some like super weeb shit i'll
tell you about after this is over
is it weevy enough that you can't even
talk about it actually i guess i can
there's like
our fans are we anyway yeah i didn't
realize there's like this whole
subset of like um it's kind of like it's
like
they're cartoons it's like web cartoons
so it's like a there's like web
whole websites of like web cartoon
comics
um they're not like manga they're more
cartoony but there are a lot of them are
from like korea and japan
where it's like um it's just porn
it's just straight up like comic book
porn
and like some of them aren't
pornographic but like a lot of them are
and they have like a thing where they'll
be like oh there's like a couple free
ones that you can read and it gets you
like right to the juicy part where
they're like oh we're about to we're
friends but we're thinking about fucking
and it's like there's tension
and then it's like joined for like and
then you look at there's like
400 other volumes on this series and
you're like how much fucking is going on
i need to know
but that but there's like a paywall
right oh yeah
yeah james speaking of paywall i'd like
to share with you and i guess the world
by youtube a dream i had last night this
is what i have
let's hear it so uh in this dream
i mess i had found a video of a porn
star
i already had it's okay i had the whole
video on my drive
and i for some reason messaged the porn
star
it was okay i found a video of yours is
it okay if i
jack off to it permission oh man
nonsense
and then she messages back and she's
like well actually i prefer if you paid
and she sent the pay link and i was
thinking of the dream like
bitch i already have this shit you need
to be so lucky even asked you as a
formality
but i asked her you know weird dreams i
never know
and then she also said and uh
by the way because like i guess the
video was like girl on girl or something
and she was like by the way it's kind of
interesting that you're using this video
because here on this like interview or
on this website
you wrote that you were like only
approved of an eye
on girl love and you did oh she knew
about you
and i was like oh yeah and i can
you know like you don't have your full
iq or even close in the dream the thing
i remember thinking is one it's nonsense
that she's asking me to paint because
fuck that
and the other thing i was like i would
never write something like that
i don't believe that it was a deep fake
ai
that was an ai interaction she was
monitoring your activity and like
putting on like a vi interface and like
oh yeah i'm like the
porn star that was they're all in our
heads already bro
dude that was a deep one like a deep
fake like took
images from the web fabricated this
person and then it's like you're
interacting with an ai who's like trying
to get you to go through their paywall
that's that's fucking skynet that's
porno skynet dude
you know porn is probably one of the
leading lights in vr technology
they innovate all sorts of cool shit
yeah
i recently ran into this thing again
highly off topic but we might as well
um milo's rolling his eyes again just oh
yeah um
we didn't have the people that watch the
shit are fucking here anyway
uh ultra conservatives you know but
total respect i respect you as much as i
respect sjw
um just kidding guys we love everyone so
they're like really anti-porn and like
vocal about it and i ran into this
instagram like page or series of pages
where all the comments like with an
anti-porn thing and all the comments
like i thought it was deep irony at
first
and then i realized these people are
serious like porn is disgusting and this
and that i'm just like
what the fuck are you guys talking about
they're getting toxic i'm like
real people still say this like they've
done every study in the world and form
doesn't do a fucking thing
to you except it probably calms you the
fuck down
like dude my dick is toxic that
causes me to do all sorts of stupid
things right porn helps
create a stop gap joe rogan had a bit
about this i don't remember which thing
he was yeah
it was like whenever you're thinking
about doing some dumb shit jerk off
first and then come back to it
because he's like you'll always make the
right decision afterwards because you're
thinking with your dick
your toxic dick right dude totally agree
it's like porn never hurts anybody well
but well yeah there are definitely
people that yeah they're getting
addicted to it there's people that get
addicted to everything man
like on average porn is just fine like
tv people getting
to the tv watching many shows and yeah
i'm definitely not
where i'm not for porn where the
participants don't want to be there so i
think we can all get behind them that's
like literally
like slavery yeah so that's bad they're
getting paid
really well i might add there's a
hilarious i follow a couple of through
marcos of course i follow a couple of
like
black meme and black joke pages you know
like uh black humor
and african-american not not dark um so
one of them was what would you do if you
oh dark humor i see i was like we have
you already
oh i got african-american uber yeah so
one of them was like um
like what would you do if you won the
lottery and this guy's like i'm gonna
have to nut first
because i need a clear head to make
really good decisions there's a jack off
i gotta check
it's so true it's so true like they give
you the money and you're like i'm gonna
be right back just go in the bathroom
and come out you're like
okay i'm gonna set up an investment
portfolio
otherwise i'm just buying hookers and
hookers yeah exactly it's so true
yeah all right uh finally einherjar
hey get the viking sword back hey josh
how slowly do you think he pronounces it
i imagine him being like oh yes my name
is
ein hair jar and you've got to say it
accurately otherwise you hate iceland
i love everything about the nordic
peoples oh yeah i could hear them talk
both in their english with their accent
or in their native language for hours on
ending
teams remember me you and mel went to
finland and we watched like five hours
of finished television we had no idea
what they were saying it's great
and it was uh i forgot the guy's name
magnus samuelson making the fish
that was like the highlight it took
three hours to make like
several days too like he had to come
back to get to that fish he was just
like this is bullshit i thought i was on
a cooking show we're gonna eat or what
all right einherjar asks hey docs it
seems like you do not condone overhead
barbell press
as a side delt movement could you
elaborate on mine i have pretty briefly
explain why this is
but i think in some cases it provides a
good side don't stimulus despite the
fatigue for me
when i do overhead press the five thin
range you get a massive pump on my front
delts side belts and crap
although it was quite fatiguing it seems
that it would have a high rusting with
magnitude
and thus the worth of fatigue for
individuals that are not insanely strong
overhead blessed like doctor mike am i
onto something
absolutely you are if it really hits
your side delts and it doesn't take you
a ton it's fucking golden the problem is
on
average it is the front delts incredibly
well for people
that hates the triceps pretty well just
doesn't do a whole lot of side delt
activity for most folks i almost never
get upside down pump from overhead
pressing
and most people don't get anything
that's notable and on the stimulus to
fatigue ratio if you're doing something
like lateral raises
especially super on lateral raises the
stimulus is better for the side belts
and the fatigue is like i don't know
like a tenth or something like that like
it's not even close but if it works for
you
oh my god we do not condone it um uh or
we do not not condone it at all
do it do it do it we just don't want
people to think that it's a staple
movement they have to do because you
like james you know how people get to
like
roller day i start out with overhead
press i move on to laterals i finish
with upright rows every day
like yeah when you overhead pressing and
if they experiment with not doing it a
lot of times they're like oh my god like
my bed press went up my skull crushers
went up because my triceps aren't tired
my shoulders hurt less and my side belts
are bigger so for many people probably
most overhead barbell press is probably
not great but if it's great for you hey
uh einderjar fucking do it up yeah
it's very much reminds me of like the
deadlift where for beginners and
you know intermediates it's a great
movement and then at some point you kind
of have to start making trade-offs
so the one that like comes to mind right
off the bat is like the
the overlap with like tricep training
where it's like you it's enough where
it's actually fatiguing your triceps to
the point where maybe you couldn't
do other more robust tricep training on
a different day
i run into that myself and that's just
the length because i have long arms so
it's a lot of times james
joint stuff shoulder joints in your
elbows you're like ah man i would skull
crush xyz but i'm beat up from shoulder
day like the fuck would you want to do
that
and then another thing too is like so at
some point you do get you know stronger
at your overhead pressing movements and
then you're like okay well if i want to
do it with a barbell the most stable way
to do it is
sitting but that setup is like a huge
pain in the ass for a lot of people to
get a good setup on that so you go okay
well let me try doing it standing and
then if you do it standing it's
inherently unstable and now you're
actually fatiguing like down the entire
kinetic chain fatigue
standing barbell press is unique right
awful so then you can say okay well what
about dumbbells okay well it's like okay
yeah you can do dumbbells but then again
it's like wait well if you're doing it
in the five to ten rep range
you've got to fucking get those like 80s
up there right
it just starts to run into like a lot of
practical limitations once you kind of
become more intermediately trained
it's not that you can't do it like if
you can do it in a way that doesn't
like for me setting up an overhead press
either dumbbell or barbell
it's just not worth the fuss because i
could just do something else with much
less fuss and maybe less systemic spill
over or muscle spillover so if you can
do it that's great i think
most people get to a point that we're
talking about where the trade-offs of
of doing it just aren't as good anymore
just like a deadlift
another really quick thing is a lot of
the side delt activation comes when
you're pushing your head
through and pushing the bar back and
when you're standing that's the best way
to do it but the standing is crazy axle
fatigue
if you sit down to press a lot of times
because you're sitting to press you
can't throw the bar back anymore
and then it's just more front delt and
less side delt anyway so it's kind of
like look if you have side if you have
front delt weakness
overhead pressing is the fucking god
king exercise of front delts there's
nothing even come close just do overhead
presses and you'll have enormous front
belts
but if it's your slide adults you want
to hitch you know there's just so many
options that are better
which is why it's funny because i've
like have like a literally always with
me bragging i have a world-class
overhead produce
and i'm one of the guys that says i
couldn't do it if you're a bodybuilder
and it's fucking weird like why wouldn't
i say you should do it
i did it for years and years just get
better at it and i got way bigger
shoulders just doing more lateral raises
and it's kind of like well that's kind
of a wussy thing this it's like
it's like if the world's like one of the
world's best squatters where it's like i
don't squat much to get my quads bigger
i'm actually just doing hack squats
watching live presses now you'd be like
oh that's a shitty thing to hear from
that guy but it's just when it's true
it's true you know
yeah totally and um one thing i noticed
when we were traveling and this is
another one of those
kind of setup issues sorry this is such
like a stupid example but it's true
um when you get used to doing like an
overhead press especially
like if it's a standing one um and then
you travel somewhere that has like a
slightly different gym floor it's like a
squishy floor and
now your session is just completely
ruined because you you just have no idea
how much weight you're supposed to use
that should happen i know it sounds dumb
but you you like okay i'm i'm pressing
155
for eight and then you go to another gym
and it's like i okay now i'm doing like
115 and it feels awkward as fuck because
the floor is different like
just stupid issues like that come up
what about a fucking seated rack setup
where it's either too far behind you oh
my god too far forward and you're either
hitting it when you come up or you're
like i can't unwrap
225 the ones that are behind me the
eight feet it's like
who did this if i can't reach it who is
going to get it
at least half of all the exercise
equipment is made by people in australia
one of the reasons why i love arsenal
equipment so much
they don't always make the best
equipment almost always a couple other
pieces i'm like
who made this but they make such good
equipment that you can tell they all
lift
and the guys the design equipment left
and you can tell you're like this was
made by people who lift weight
yeah like this is a fucking awesome
piece of equipment because it's designed
to be used
some equipment like i don't need to call
it out it's just in my experience
especially the older models the newer
stuff is better
have you ever used techno gym james
especially in europe yeah that's like
who made this this the handles are like
it's thicker than fucking god's dick
it's like am i supposed to have straps
that are eight feet long
why are we here what is going on like
yes their assisted pull-up machine
the way your back naturally pulls
actually pours sideways into the machine
so you end up just going
you generate a shit with friction and
the way to move the machine most
like the most smoothly is like this
movement you would never do in your life
like okay they never tested this on
human beings
clearly yeah no there's there's always
going to be some sneakers the one that
always get me is the um the ones
i don't remember what brand it's the the
ones that are like gyroscopic that the
machine moves around while you're doing
it
hoist yes those are makes them moist
yeah
some people like they're like oh this
one's great for me it's like always a
distraction and i'm always like what the
fuck
is this what am i doing um to me it's
piece by piece
the hoist chest press mostly because it
allows a really deep stretch it's just
wonderful
magical miracle machine having nothing
to do with the fact that it moves by the
way it's just a deep stretch
but they're like seated row it moves
purposelessly i might add
but the handles are literally thicker
than this fucking microphone
they're like enormous and i'm like why
like fucking versagrip around these
on a pulling device this is insane yeah
all right well i think that's that was
it for this one yeah
11 questions because sam got an extra
one oh very good um let's see
i don't think i have any housekeeping
stuff folks i just finished mass effect
legendary edition and i am in a show
hole my god
it's like a hundred hours of gameplay
and then it comes to like a big climax
if you guys haven't checked it out
my uh it's it's one of the best like
sci-fi
universes it's like the game the
gameplay is just like third person
shooter
you know kind of like star wars-y kind
of stuff but it's the story the story's
so good it's three games
each game you make your character makes
decisions and those decisions carry
across
each game and you can get very distinct
play experiences across all three games
depending on what you do
they do kind of all come to a similar
ending um man is it good so if you guys
haven't checked out
massive i mean that came out when like
we were undergrads in college and they
just re-released it
it's fucking good it's booking just by
the way a little insight into our
personal lives you
probably don't want to know um one of my
favorite things to do my
myself and another friend of ours who
will go unnamed
we'd like to get unreal high on edibles
marijuana is legal in the states in
which we are and uh
watch games play video games i swear to
god man
i'm like in this other world
yeah and there's one game which one was
the sea the sea game i was looking for
subnautica
it's like these aliens built this
essentially artificial planet
and it's all like underwater and like
you discover these alien artifacts and
every time
like remember we discovered that by we i
mean you you discovered like the um
that the sea was actually artificial
because it had like a vent of water
flowing into it like at the bottom of
the yeah the ocean
when you discovered that i was saying hi
as fuck i was like
oh my god it was i was so blown away it
was worth 100 of all that time
i got pissed at that game because i'm
like at this point where i have like
this giant fucking like submarine and i
have to go get the like
lava crystals and there's a fucking like
crack oh lich that's cock-blocking me
from the lava crystals and i can't
figure it out and i was like fuck this
game
to see if uh nerds have figured out how
to beat them
uh i i gave up on it i was it was one of
those where i like
i threw in the towels pissed i was like
fucking crack oh lich
god damn it i think back everything i
said about our video game relationship
you you would like mass effect it's
basically like um
it's like playing it's like it's like
playing game of thrones
because it's long it means it's like
it's like 100 hours of gameplay
collectively so it's like you're like
basically playing a movie or a show
it's amazing my attention span is done
after like
two fights
that was great uh anyway all right
that's it any announcements any fun
things we have some announcements in a
few weeks to make but we'll make those
