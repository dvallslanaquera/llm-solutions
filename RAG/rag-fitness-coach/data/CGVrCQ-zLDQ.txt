hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
muscle gain dieting made simple video
number four
choosing meal size and choosing the
timing and the number of meals of course
last time we finished structuring a diet
and detract
healthy and macro specific foods so we
know what we're eating
we're also eating a certain amount of
macros and of course we're eating mostly
healthy foods
but that doesn't describe as much as we
would think because it's like okay are
we eating
all that in one meal and two meals how
far part of the meals is
six meals we have to figure out how many
meals to eat
and when to eat them and what ratio of
macros to put into each meal that is
basically all of nutrient timing right
there
and there are a few factors that sort of
weigh in on why this is important
first a regular meal schedule has been
shown to increase adherence it's much
easier to get all your meals in if you
know what meals you're getting in
hitting your daily macros can be real
tough because if you don't have
pre-planned meals
especially with massing especially if
you're not hungry you can find yourself
you know at 8 pm you have to smash 2 500
calories
overly good left over because you're a 4
000 calorie diet
1500 calories throughout the whole day
was more than enough and all of a sudden
you're
basically an impossible situation
outside of stuffing yourself and
throwing up in your sleep or something
like that so adherence is really good
because it keeps you on track
a regular meal schedule in addition
makes meal prep and your daily schedule
50 times easier
if you're trying to gain muscle and a
lot of folks that struggle with eating
enough to gain muscle or really in this
situation
they go to work they don't bring any
meals they're working and they're on a
super productive streak the boss calls
the client calls all of a sudden you're
on a bunch of phone calls
you notice oh my god it's 4 p.m oh shit
i missed lunch and this my mid-morning
slack what the hell but if you prep all
of your meals
you have your meals timed in advance you
just take out tupperware from the fridge
at
you know 11 15 a.m eat your mid-morning
snack at 2 p.m eat your lunch
and then at 4 p.m when you check your
you know your clock or your watch
you're gonna be like oh wow like uh yeah
i did a lot of work today it was really
great it was super crazy day at the
office
but i got all my meals in them because
they were all always here the entire
time and i just set a few alarms on my
phone
a few reminders the rp diet app actually
does all that for you
and wink wink buy our stuff i need money
but in any case
that makes the situation much easier and
just much more likely you'll hit all
those numbers
it's especially if you struggle eating
especially if you're not hungry
you may actually forget to eat and then
you're in a situation where like
you had a decent week of muscle gain
training but three of the days during
the week you just didn't eat enough and
sometimes you can't dig your way out of
that
and essentially just becomes another
week of maintenance you're not training
so hard to try to gain muscle to just
maintain
right so that's not a really good thing
and of course proper meal size and
timing
makes your workouts better it makes your
workouts sort of feel better
they're more effective for stimulating
anabolism and preventing catabolism
your daily energy is higher and of
course you can sleep better in the case
of mass gaining
eating too much at night in that earlier
example can make your sleep really
crappy you wake up like
covered in sweat because the carbs are
digesting and all this stuff a lot of
times
eating a lot before you go to sleep is
linked with sleep disturbances and not
the highest quality sleep
there's a lot we can do there and of
course a proper plan
can allow you to eat more if you need to
and here's the big thing with that
if you're pushing food in such a way
that is difficult
which as you get to a certain mass level
will happen to almost everyone
if you don't eat at the times you're
supposed to in the amounts you're
supposed to
your hunger just isn't enough to keep
you eating naturally
and you get to the end of the day with
an insurmountable calorie surplus left
over that you have to smash
it's not going to happen and you're not
going to get the results as you get more
and more advanced and bigger
this meal planning and meal timing
really absolutely earns its weight
more and more and more so how many meals
are we supposed to eat well you
technically can eat one meal per day and
do just fine
you're not watching this video because
you want to do just fine you want to do
a little bit better than just fine
so you may eat something like three to
five or even more meals per day than
that three to five is a great range
you can't eat six anything in past six
like seven is just completely
superfluous and if it makes sense
through the schedule if you really
like d frequently great but three to
five is really kind of our golden number
because it gets
a couple of things going for us first it
lets you eat a lot of food total per day
you may think you can eat a lot in one
meal and you may be correct but if you
eat only one meal per day
every day was like a 4 000 calorie meal
that's kind of insane and most people
just can't eat that much in a single day
so by spreading out your meals to three
or five meals or anywhere in between
you end up in a situation where you can
eat until you're pretty full eat until
you're pretty full you feel pretty full
and then you've gotten tons of calories
just by sort of meticulously splitting
them up and actually doing all the work
it's like this if you were to try to do
as many push-ups in a day as possible
don't
do that at home it's a fucking stupid
idea so the whole thing is pointless but
just as a quick analogy
and i gave you an hour you would
probably do a lot of push-ups in an hour
but in a certain amount of time your
muscles are too fatigued and it just
wouldn't work you just can't do any more
push-ups so you maybe get i don't know a
thousand or something like that
but what if i said you had the whole day
or like 16 hours to do push-ups well of
course you'd get more
right because every time you fatigue you
can take a break for a while and come
back and do more
same idea with eating when you really
have to push the food you need the whole
day to push as much food as you need
one or two or three meals may not cut it
three four or five meals may be a much
better idea
of course you need energy for training
and eating a little bit a few hours
before training
is the best way to provide that so again
meal frequency has to be at least before
training
eating after training is really
important especially for the nutrients
that
support muscle growth so at least that's
two meals right there pre-training and
post-training
and of course you want energy for your
daily tasks you're not just trying to
gain
muscle you're trying to be a productive
human being hopefully in society you are
already
so you need other meals spaced out
somewhere else and that ends up yeah
being like three to five meals or
something like that
how do you want to spread those meals
though because you could technically
have five meals
have a meal at seven a.m eight a.m nine
am so on and so forth and by like
lunch you've had all your five meals for
the day meals for the day right
you want to spread them a little bit
more rationally you want a meal a few
hours
at most after waking after you wake up
catabolism muscle breakdown is pretty
high you want to mute that right away
and of course if you have trouble eating
all of your calories through the day
you kind of want to get a good start on
eating as soon as you wake up because
that gives you more time throughout the
day to eat if you spend like three hours
after waking not eating
you've constructed your calorie window
quite a bit which for fat loss can be
decent
for muscle gain especially when you're
having trouble eating not the greatest
idea in the world
so a meal a few hours after waking or
fewer
a post-workout meal to fuel muscle
growth and of course
ideally some food before you know
several hours before
to get lots of energy sort of capped off
have a great training session
great big post-workout meal to begin
that anabolic muscle building process
in general throughout the day a meal at
least every six hours more like every
four to five
that's been shown a few times to
maximize anabolism over the long term
maximizes muscle growth
and of course a meal within two hours of
bedtime
uh there's a bit of a sort of
fungibility there if you eat the meal
way like you know four hours before
bedtime it's probably not the greatest
idea because then
by the end of the of the night in your
sleep you're not really supporting
muscle growth you're actually
potentially losing a little bit muscle
you regain that muscle no problem but
the net gains over time might not be as
great
you don't want to eat really really
close to bedtime like right before in
most cases
because your stomach will be sort of
prioritizing digestion instead of just
sitting there
and then all of a sudden that can
actually interfere with sleep especially
if it's a lot of food you can be
uncomfortable you can't turn on your
tummy where you maybe normally sleep
because you're like oh holy shit
like um i'm so full this is just wildly
uncomfortable so we don't want that
but like uh your last meal a day
happening between two hours and one hour
before you go to sleep is
generally a great idea for most people
and that's how you spread out those
meals so three to five meals generally
spread out like that
what about macros okay protein we spread
relatively evenly every meal has about
the same amount of protein
because muscle growth is a real
continuous process it occurs over days
and not hours so it's not like right
after the workout you want a ton of
protein and then three hours later you
want a little bit because the muscle
growth has
petered off a bit muscle growth actually
accelerates for hours after training
and then for hours and hours and hours
and days after training stays elevated
after two or three days it starts to
come back down to oral baseline levels
so every four to six hours on average
except for the night time which is a
little longer
you're going to feed yourself roughly
the same amount of protein carbs are
different story
carbs are good for energy before workout
and they're great for recovery after the
workout so you want most of your carbs
sorry a disproportionately high amount
of carbs through the day
to be post-workout and pre-workout and
then potentially fewer carbs at later
times
that's generally a good template until
and unless on a mass gaining phase you
start eating
so much food and so much carb that
someone might say like hey
it's breakfast you're eating 100 grams
of carbs why you don't train until 4 pm
and then the answer is i just have to
get 700 grams of carbs today
and my post-workout meal has 150 or 200
which is
crazy i can't eat any more carbs if i
just eat carbs all around the workout
window i got to spread them out so when
you have to spread them out do it
but make sure more of them on average
just by a small fraction
are around that workout window and fats
have the opposite
behavior as carbs most of them stay away
from the workout window so if you work
out in the middle of the day
your morning is going to have lots of
fats your evening is going to have lots
of fats very
few low fat situation pre-workout and
post-workout
because fats generally tend to slow
digestion and especially if you're
having really hard workouts and you're
stuffing yourself
those two don't gel very well because at
higher reps on the leg press and squat
after you've had chipotle burrito half
an hour before it's coming back up the
other way
i guess you get to have the burrito
again but in reverse
not as good as it sounds maybe it sounds
bad and it's as good as it sounds
so we don't want to go down that path so
we want to keep fats lower
coming into the workout plenty of
protein and carbs a few hours before
that way we don't have a situation where
we start lifting we're like oh god like
this food's got to go somewhere and if i
keep lifting super hard
it's going to go back the other way
right bad bad deal so
quick sample meal plan from you guys so
150 pound person from our last video
daily macros is 150 protein uh 215 carbs
60 grams of fat pretty standard this is
where you would sort of begin muscle
gain
and actually this you know this plan i
think
i just copied and pasted it from the fat
loss diet because here's the thing
your masking diet will often begin right
after a fat loss diet
and it begins with literally the same
foods and everything else the stuff you
layer on top of it later as it gets
tougher
that'll be different and we'll talk
about that in a future video series so
this
has a lot of the same stuff as our fat
loss guy did but notice
the carbs are higher around the sort of
workout time
and they're lower outside of the workout
time that's where the fats are higher
just pause the video if you like take a
look at those uh sort of sample amounts
and you'll notice that the protein's
roughly the same or similar between
meals
give that a look it should make plenty
of sense all right so
next time we're going to talk about
supplements and hydration
to make sure that's all squared away and
then the videos after that are going to
be more advanced
about how to manipulate our core diet
that we've built and so far
we've built a really good core plan and
day to day your eating doesn't have to
be identical
but it should be pretty similar multiple
you know four on average meals per day
or something like that
protein every meal some days are shorter
some are longer
some you train twice a day some you
train zero sometimes you train once you
have lots of carbs before and after
training sometimes fewer
but the general patterns are pretty
similar so your days don't need to be
identical but they should be pretty
similar
this is really good for getting on a
consistent plan having repeatability
predictability
and making sure that you're sort of
check plusing all of your columns
to get yourself the best chances of
growing muscle
next time we'll talk about supplements
and hydration real quick video to
checklist that because there's not a lot
going on there
and then we'll talk about the more
advanced manipulations to actually get
where you want to go from your first
best guess which you can put together
just with these five videos alone
folks see you next time for the next
video
