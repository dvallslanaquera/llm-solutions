weekly tip number two
just a tiny little tip for you guys to
get a little bit more out of your
exercise out of your nutrition out of
your recovery
elbows forward on bicep curls that's an
interesting tip what the hell do i mean
by that
you can do curls with free weights
machines dumbbells cables whatever you
want and they're all super effective
you can do them in many many ways here's
a cool way to try that might actually
help you especially form a better mind
muscle connection with your biceps which
i really often struggle with and might
actually help with hypertrophy as well
as you reach the top of a curl
what i want you to try practicing
is even if the bicep is stopping you
there's nowhere to go squeezing your
forearm into your bicep pretty fucking
hard almost as hard as you can and a lot
of times if you're here it doesn't feel
like you get a lot of squeeze so as
you're curling instead of staying here
with your elbows down bring your elbows
up and squeeze up here
if you do that your bicep actually has a
few functions one of them
is to move the shoulder up this way
similar to the front delt so people say
like oh you're using delts it's cheating
it's not cheating it actually uses your
bicep and because it shortens the biceps
significantly more it can get you a
crazy peak contraction
once you've done about a second of
squeezing at the top of wrap you slowly
keep that squeeze
and undo it just enough to let the
weight slowly pull you down and then you
come up again and squeeze really hard
elbows forward and come down let the
elbows arch back down
this can increase your mind muscle
connection burn the living shit out of
your biceps and can potentially get you
slightly better results
give it a try
