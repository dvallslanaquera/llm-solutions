[Applause]
[Music]
folks it's dr mike that's jared feather
this is sachi butler we are training her
legs for the last hard leg workout she
has before the universe competition
coming up soon when you see this or
already have been so you can frantically
google to see where she placed
she for some reason volunteered to do
legs with us and you guys know what that
means by now pain suffering and the
elated joy of a transcendent experience
see you in the next exercise
[Applause]
first exercise so we have quite a quite
a mission for us we were told it needs
to be a glute
and quad and hamstring situation
all of the same workout so we're going
to use exercises that cover a lot of
ground at the same time the first
exercise is going to be sumo deficit
deadlifts amazing glute exercise
and pretty decent adductor exercise too
decent quad exercise as well again not a
super target exercise we have a lot to
do so we're going to start here multiple
sets of roughly 10 to 15 repetitions per
set probably going to go with a gentle
touch and go technique everything on
here is technique super upright posture
knees opening up very gentle touches no
heat hauling remember to keep the bar as
close to your body as possible the
entire
the entire time the entire time the
entire time let's do it close
seven slow
up let's go

one more let's go saucy come on
last night here
adjust the chest up beautiful slow
yeah very good
very
[Music]
[Music]
good finish with sumo deficit deadlifts
now stiff-legged deadlifts
in an ideal world
we would do some other exercise now to
rest the lower back so it wouldn't be a
limiting factor but in the real world
you got the bar out you got the weight
loaded you just need to take some weight
off and then you can overtrain
hamstrings coming back unloading unless
you train in your own facility not a
good idea just to get right into it
and the of course the classic tips on
simply that lift
tummy out chat stop to get the hips
pre-stretched and you're going to
descend your knees are going to be just
like this the whole time this is no good
this is no good it's really tough you
know what's working when you have pain
deep in the back of your legs and your
hamstrings we're gonna be doing a few
sets here
five to ten reps because they're slow on
the way down the time under tension is
actually more like for a set of ten to
twenty reps even if you do a set of five
to ten
yep
[Music]
good straighter knees
hamstrings there it is
very good
straighter leg straight
yes there you go
a couple more doing great
straight straight straight

and then super slow down slow
slow
slow slow
slow
and
down phenomenal best rep ever
that was the most painful rep we've ever
seen on this channel
world's longest rep good stuff excellent
stuff
[Music]
two things
first
sachi's on the leg press now gee you
know she needs a lot of quad volume here
so we might do as many as five sets
and she is too tiny she's like four foot
nine or something and that means we need
to put some padding into the leg press
luckily it's an arsenal leg press which
is the best black press in the world
and we have rigged the machine so that
it gets super super deep on her
because her first time doing super full
rod leg press
she actually doesn't need to load hardly
any weight under the bar it's like 125
on the thing
so that is what it is doing her best
pushing she's a week out from a show
this is as tired as she'll ever be
that's the situation we do our best with
what we have and what we're able to do
thing number two
i'm thinking of dropping a rap mixtape
what do you guys think about that let me
know in the comments
good
again
try
up
go go go go
rack
[Music]
oh very good very good
we want sachi to get a bit of more of a
stimulus than just the leg press can
offer she's super tired super depleted
and there's only so many leg press reps
she can do what we're gonna have her do
is after each set of leg press for the
next few sets as soon as she's done
she's going to hop out and do body
weight squats her level of depletion and
fatigue it's actually going to be pretty
decent stimulus if you try this at home
make sure your transition from when
you're done leg pressing
to when you start squatting is as rapid
as possible because that means the
metabolites are still sequestered and
you'll still get a really good stimulus
if you wait like one or two minutes uh
you're gonna get as much out of it as
you normally do out of bodyweight squats
which is to say precisely
a dick
let's do it
push
good one more
breathe let's go
slow
[Music]
you're resting at the top sachi stop
resting at the top

sorry jared
i heard you say pause and i was like
already like oh
dude that was awesome that was awesome
very good very good
[Music]
folks last exercise of the day the
barbell squat quads are annihilated from
the leg press to goblet squat superset
a little bit more glute time hamstrings
are fried
finishing off of squats not a ton of uh
use for load here so the load is minimal
sets of oh probably about actually five
to 10 reps issues so pretty exhausted
our quads are taking the load the entire
time a couple sets of squats to finish
off this workout
best of luck to her
sanji squat down not back
down
yes
up
good
that's five
up
six chest up jerry sides chest up
touching
knees forward he's forward
[Music]
[Music]
that's better
yeah it gets hard and you start to shift
right back because you know your
hamstrings and your glutes aren't taxed
yet so it feels good to put it on
different muscles but try to keep it in
the quads
as low as you can go as low as you can
go
ah
yes good that was a perfect rep
super deep
chest up
chest up
[Music]
go
one more
super deep
super deep
chest off
[Music]
good shit
sachi you are in fucking crazy shape
when you're coming up i can see your
glutes relations through your shorts
they're going like this
you're officially out of body fat
no more body fat
damn girl all right that's crazy
