hit it go go go go go go slow slow slow
pause I did some RP bodybuilding today
stick with me stick with me almost there
this is gonna be a bad week
[Music]
folks we are in Cookeville Tennessee at
CrossFit Mayhem me as you know I'm
pretty good at CrossFit
top 10 percent
okay
this is Rich Froning he's essentially
the best of all time certainly in the
conversation for the best of all time me
I'm just the best kind of right now but
he's a legend appreciate it and so I'll
be taking a back seat
Tyler here made an enormous mistake he
will learn that very soon
he jumped into this workout you work out
here this workout oh oh you barely had
that that's true that's true there's not
much he took his shirt off he did he was
ready he haven't even started training
in any case
rich is going to take a shot at the
title to do an RP style hypertrophy
quadriceps workout which actually only
means we do two exercises as it is a
CrossFit gym we are bereft of machines
but we have one squat rack and a whole
lot of open space do you sharp folks out
there probably thinking we're going to
do a whole lot of high rep squats and a
whole lot of high rep lunges superseded
summarily two high rep squats and uh
that would be crazy of you to think what
an insane idea let's go do it
all right so first rule is keep your
chest up higher the entire time
especially at the bottom excellent
second rule is at the bottom very bottom
when you get all the way down stop for
two whole full seconds each and every
time perfect rule number three is
descend three times slower than that so
you're gonna milk The Descent yes
excellent
good just like that slow
warm-ups have been done the guys are
ready to go
the idea here is to do squats for lots
and lots of reps
people talk about 20 rep squats is kind
of the way to build legs that used to be
a thing people talked about all the time
they are probably more efficient ways to
do this
but since this is a CrossFit gym when in
Rome we are here for the pain and by we
I mean these guys
dude
[Music]
[Applause]
foreign
one more
[Music]
chest up
up 17 rest breathe a little bit don't go
anywhere let's finish up these big three
whenever you're ready awesome
one
stay off right
stop up
two one last one let's finish out these
20.
hit it stop slow up
wrap gorgeous
hell yeah
whenever you're ready
to control wow Tyler that was excellent
one
again slow I'm gonna be really insistent
that the guys go down slow
got to keep their chests up that they
take full pauses at the bottom
and that they're trying to use their
quads by not just squatting back and
down but by squatting back and down and
then letting the knees drift forward on
the way down staying as upright as
possible
it's going to put maximum tension on the
quads it's going to be a she's gonna say
bad time but that's not really the case
it's gonna be a good bad time these guys
are in excellent cardio shape so if they
want to Maya rep this which means that
the top of after you do five or six
squats and get tired if you want to sit
here for about three or four seconds
take a couple breaths and then Begin
Again Kudos will agree between the two
of us when it's time to rack
[Music]
up
good technique slow chest up pause up
rap beautiful
the 20 in the bank
how you feeling yep
that's a good answer yup feeling feeling
just on the clamps taking my time slow
control pause up
last button coming up
right now right now right now go go go
go go go slow
slow control chest Up Stand Up Up rack
dude fuck yeah
feeling your back on this yeah yeah like
it's not bad just tired yeah yeah yeah
ideally we don't do barbell squats for
sets of 20. why one of the reasons is
that other factors than the quadriceps
tend to become limiting
these folks are international Elite
level crossfitters so their lungs you
notice did not become limiting they
never even breathe heavy during sets of
20 in the squat which is kind of crazy
if you think about it at all however
their backs did start to take over and
it became more of a lower back limited
exercise and a glute limited exercise
than it was a quad limited exercise so
what we did was we lowered the weight
here
and we put the guys up on plates
put heels under the plates you can stay
more upright you can get your knees more
forward it becomes more limiting by the
quads than it would be by the lower back
by the mid-back by even the upper back
after a while sets of 20 just holding
the bar
becomes irritating for the arms and The
Traps you can lose some function in your
arms for a second as the nerves get a
little caught up in there
it's rough if you only have a rack at
home you only have a barbell can you do
this for hypertrophy yeah you sure can
it'll absolutely grow everything in your
lower body mostly your quads glutes and
lower back but with these little
modifications we can get it to be just a
little bit better
up
18. stay upright
go go go slow slow pause up again last
one hit it go go go go go go slow slow
slow pause up
rack
beautiful
a little better for the back better yeah
excellent
I'm not gonna be able to walk tomorrow
good again slow slow slow slow slow slow
up last one make it perfect
slow
extra slow
rack
oh yeah one cent left up
breathe your Technique only good
technique only if you have to dump no
worries three and you're done hit it
slow
up
one
slow
up
two last one big chest
slow
up
hell yeah rack
are we
last set of this exercise
one
move with your legs not with your back
stand straight up when you get out of
the hole up straight two three more
real good up good two more
up one more
stand straight up
practice
go good nope
don't be messed up till Friday the guys
have done five sets of 20 in the squat
which is fun to think about now it's
time for the lunge to squat superset to
really finish out the quads really
finish cooking everything they're gonna
have weighted vests on because holding
weights for that many lunges is annoying
we're going to talk about how to do the
lunge technique in a second
let's get to it
lunges I hate them here's what we're
gonna well good news bad news we have a
particular way of doing lunges at RP
that's gonna suck more probably you're
gonna hate them more good so again that
focuses on quality instead of just
quantity
uh every single lunch step you just want
to keep a couple rules one is within
reason step nice and long so none of
this this right long step and especially
on the way down keeping your upper body
upright if you have to kick forward a
little bit on the way up not a big deal
but none of this bullshit like this so a
bad lunge wrap would look like this
and then a good one
would look like that
alternating no rush
we're just gonna do this shit at the
same time if you guys are okay with that
a little friendly competition between
the boys then we get in the locker room
later huh no no takers every day in the
locker room 40 steps
and then after 40 steps set up your
squat setup
slow and controlled up
slow and controlled up no rest at the
Top If you have to rest you rest in a
full bottom position 20 squats
40 slow quality lunges 20 squats and if
you guys can time them to do roughly the
same great if not no big deal
slower on the way down gentlemen
excellent
14. slower
15 good especially under the center 16.
40 turn Face Forward hands up
squats one nineteen
[Music]
20 reps brief for a second
how'd that feel yep
30 lunges
30 and then 15.
[Music]
25
and 12.
begin when ready slow lunges there's no
rush to complete these the purpose is
the pain
22 doing great guys

sets left and that's the whole workout
25 and 12 again
slow
gentle touches of the knee begin now
24.
25 okay bonus round I want you to squat
and stay at the bottom with your chest
upright until I say up that's how every
squat is going to work until we're nice
and cooked good to go
down
up
heels and Toes Tyler there you go down
chest up
huh
down
hold
up
again
slow
chest off
[Music]
and last one slow
deep
hold keep your chest up as much as you
can
stick with me stick with me almost there
up and done
yeah good shit fellas
it hurt that was solid it hurt me
watching good stuff
good stuff
Bill's overqualified look at them legs
couple observations
about
Elite level CrossFit
one is as far as I can tell they don't
have a gas tank I don't know where this
stuff comes from but they just keep
going it's strange
another thing is nobody really took a
lot of big breaths the entire time
nobody's out of breath again very
strange
another thing
they do tend to revert back to sport
style technique of getting the job done
quick and efficiently versus exposing
the muscles so there has to be lots of
cueing to make sure we do things on
purpose inefficiently to get the target
muscles hit versus just doing the job
that being said these guys take
instruction like machines
and zero complaining and at the end of
every set at which I thought they were
for sure gonna die they were just like
yeah that sucked and then they just kind
of walk off it's weird it's surreal this
is not their first workout it's not
their first 1500th workout
unbelievable gentlemen an honor an honor
and I'm sorry about what happens to your
legs in the next few days
are you guys competitive bodybuilders
now is it official oh this is it yeah
we're there this is the transition yes
all the units I need for 2022 yeah today
so what'd you guys think of the workout
it's good it's hard
definitely it's something I need to do
more of just with
I've got this left knee just for a tour
of that meniscus and just try to
strengthen everything around it you know
just like you're saying we do
specific stuff efficiency and so I'm not
really worried about isolating a
particular muscle the older I get and
it'd probably be more advantageous even
when I was younger to do more
Target sure things you know find things
that are going to Target and strengthen
things around that knee sure any type of
injury that's something I've learned
with this shoulder uh issue I've had you
know I've got a couple tears in the
rotator cuff just from 13 years of
competitive CrossFit like it's going to
happen so if I can strengthen the delt
um the packs the rhomboids everything
around it keeps everything safe
everything's stable and so that's
something that I've learned over the
last I'm not I've known it I just don't
like to revert back to that because it's
not as fun it's not oh yeah she is what
we do I want to come in here and hurt
because that's what we're the way we're
programmed
um and so it's it's good to do this type
of stuff slightly more focused yeah more
Focus yeah think about what muscles are
getting uh innervated and you know a
little bit of kinesthetic awareness and
thinking about all right I'm trying to
Target something here and I'm trying to
you know strengthen and grow yes
different sides yes what's the secret to
the hair why is it so luscious and why
is it so full of volume don't know I
haven't said it in a while just genetics
just Raw Talent yeah thanks Mom yeah of
course
cheating
um
I'll have hair tips later you guys know
this is mostly hair Channel yeah what
are you asking me and then like look I'm
trying to use for that I'm just gifted
yeah I'm saying gentlemen thank you so
much for your time thank you for
humoring my absurd nonsense of humor
