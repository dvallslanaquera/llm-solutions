hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
with an interesting question how much
wood
could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck
could chuck wood
up until now we as a society have
prioritized very few resources to answer
this incredibly important question
i suspect we should do the following
genetically engineer woodchucks to be
able to actually chuck wood
keep them in giant matrix style farms
where woodchucks are no longer born
they're grown they no longer have
woodchuck names but merely woodchuck
numbers
and find out how we can engineer them
further to a robotic
genetic
combination perfection to chuck as much
physical wood as possible while we're
working on that however
let's talk about how to fix muscle
asymmetries
huge huge question we get all the time
let's dig into it so first there's
actually
two different kinds of muscle
asymmetries
in physique that we can talk about
there's
non-bilateral aesthetic asymmetry this
is all aesthetic because we're not
talking about strength and performance
just about how you look
non-bilateral asymmetry means
one muscle group both sides of the body
is smaller than by comparison to
another muscle group and or the rest of
the muscles in the body
for example your calves just too small
for your hams and quads people like ooh
your legs are huge what the hell
happened to your calves
right the omar isuf problem ah omar i'm
just playing with you i guess that's
technically a critique that applies so
that's a thing
but if your calves are roughly
equivalently sized it's a problem that's
relatively straightforward to bring up
because well clearly you just try to
train your calves as good as possible
and maybe like train the other stuff a
little bit less something like that
right and if you're really curious about
more detail on how to solve that
problem when both of your muscles on
both sides of the body
are behind some other muscle groups we
have a video called growing stubborn
body parts
it's on the rp strength or renaissance
prioritization youtube
and check that out and it's got a tons
it's got an hour of information about
how to get super super detailed
however what we're going to talk about
today
is bilateral aesthetic asymmetry which
means
one muscle is smaller than its mirror
muscle on the other side of the body
by enough to bother you
it definitely means enough for you to
notice so like something like one bicep
is notably bigger than the other
what do we do about that that is the
topic of today's video
now first question is why do these
bilateral asymmetries even exist
we have a few culprits culprit number
one is genetics right
nobody's body is perfectly symmetrical
it's just the case
they're pretty close but nobody's
perfect
second thing what does that mean
nobody's perfectly symmetrical and why
specifically well sometimes one of the
muscles on one side of the body
has a bigger muscle belly than the other
just by genetics
longer muscle fibers to make up that
bigger muscle belly
more fibers physically packed in faster
fibers potentially even more satellite
cells
so what ends up happening is not only
does that fiber start out bigger or that
muscle hole start out bigger but it may
even have a bigger growth potential
and a bigger growth response so that
every time you train both biceps one of
them just
started out bigger some combination gets
bigger over training and has a bigger
ceiling
to how large it can get eventually with
all of your efforts put in
that absolutely happens one muscle to
muscles usually small difference
but muscles are not identical in any of
those things and sometimes the
difference can be big enough
to actually present themselves right
sometimes
that's just for no good goddamn reason
at all except luck of the draw genetics
just happens
sometimes this actually occurs
not because of genetics per se but
because
it is to compensate for other genetics
that are off
or other developmental factors that are
off for example if
one of your legs is a little bit shorter
than the other one of your calves
can actually get more daily use because
it has to
work more to close the distance to keep
your gate
looking normal so in that case sometimes
you know one of your clavicles will
shorten the other one of your
you know your rib cage points a certain
way and all of a sudden muscles which
even genetically could have started out
identical
have different lifetime loading
parameters and become differently sized
and slightly different shaped
in order to account for and fix skeletal
asymmetries
which everyone has remember this is a
file under some stuff of
shit you can't do anything about it's
just gonna happen
it's not your fault you're not a morally
you know irreconcilable person
it's just a thing that happens now
that's factor number one
another factor is daily use if you train
a particular muscle very little close to
its minimum effect of volume or
something like that
whichever side of the body you use
will usually be bigger because you train
that
side more because you train both sides
minimally together
and then adding the volume on top from
daily use from that other side that you
are essentially using more you get more
of a stimulative response especially if
the stuff you use it for is relatively
high resistance
like a mechanic who screws in you know
various nuts and bolts
with a big wrench if he usually mostly
uses his right hand or more than his
left
you know there's a high force activity
and he probably doesn't use his left
hand to even train with weights or maybe
he does a little bit of weights
the left hand is going to be your left
arm uh
in russian it's the same word that's why
i always mix up arm and hand um
the left arm will be like notably a
little bit smaller right because he just
does a ton of this wrenching stuff right
insert your favorite arm preference
masturbation joke
right here lap it up uh so we can get
over and move on to the next thing right
but that's fundamentally how that can
happen
however there's another way it can go if
you train both sides of your body
to within your mev mrv window the
optimum training amount
right the the amount of training that
both sides get is
within the gym already maxing out for
growth
whichever side you use more daily life
can be smaller
okay how the hell is that possible well
that side is used
more than the other side which means it
depletes its glycogen more
which means it's less anabolic at any
one given time because how much glycogen
you're storing
has a direct link to how anabolic you
are from any training stimulus okay so
that's problem number one
fiber conversion especially for repeated
use activities like stacking cups or
something like that
that actually converts some of your
fibers in that
arm or whatever leg that you're using
more often
to slower twitch variants that tend to
grow less
from any given set of training so
because you're already training to the
max any more activity that converts your
fibers to slower twitch for that
often used side ends up making the often
use side not as big as the less often
you
signed extra fatigue comes in if you
spent all day stacking up plates or
something with your right arm
it's not going to perform as well as
your left arm in the gym and training so
the training stimulus won't be as high
you have to have extra fatigue to
recover from so not only do you have to
recover from training
you also have to recover from the
fatigue of like stacking plates or
whatever you're doing that's a problem
there's only
a maximum amount of recovery resources
you have and all of the resources come
from the same barrel so to speak
so recovery spent from plate stacking is
recovery you could have spent
from training and of course the physical
extra fatigue incurred during the
process of training recovery
so for example i'll use something that's
you know sort of near and dear to my
heart in brazilian jiu jitsu
i use i don't know it depends on for
which move but let's say i use my right
hand a little bit more
for passing when i'm passing around
somebody's guard
right i do a awesome session in which i
train my arms
and during jiu jitsu a few hours later
my left
side does mostly recovering my right
side when it's supposed to be recovering
and growing from training
is busy doing this bullshit guard
passing and that at the time not just
for total fatigue but at that recovery
time
interferes so it is absolutely possible
that if you're already training whatever
muscles in the body very hard
what you could be doing is by doing more
daily activity you could be taking away
from it not adding
right now point number three or factor
number three of how the symmetry can
happen is asymmetrical technique
right like you're benching off center or
one arm strong on the other you're not
fixing it
i'm not gonna address this anymore in
this video because that's some shit you
have to fix
it's obvious how to fix it light lighten
up the weight
get a little further from failure rework
back in with perfect technique okay if
your technique sucks and that's the
reason you have any symmetry that is
inexcusable
is the most obvious thing in the world
to fix right so
granted that's the case maybe we'll
figure out how to fix it but before you
try to fix it you say okay damn it one
of my biceps is bigger than the other
one of my triceps
i gotta fix it before you try let's
figure out what exactly
we're getting ourselves into and if we
want to fix it at all so a couple of
points here
now there's nothing wrong with fixing it
but just know the following
first be sure that you care enough
maybe you do so fine make sure that
others care if you're doing it for
someone else
usually almost always nobody
can tell okay you folks have seen my
physique plenty in all these videos or
whatever which one of my biceps is
bigger than the other which one
what about calves what about quads what
about pecs
some of those i know distinctly uh to be
honest for pex i have no idea
right jay cutler mr olympia multiple
times
did you guys know that one of his arms
was distinctly bigger than the other
especially biceps which one was it
you may some combination of had no idea
that that was the case
and or don't remember which one it was
right and maybe you do and you're like
yeah okay it was left i don't even
remember which one it was right
but the thing is is that when people see
jay cutler's physique
they're not like this is an olympia
quality look at his arms they're
completely
different size they were notably
different size but i bet you didn't
notice
and even if you did that motherfucker
won the olympia
like four times clearly muscle ace
infantries can't mean
that big of a deal to anyone if people
are walking on the olympia stage and
winning that shit with them
right so before you think this is the
worst thing in the world because people
will do that
i've done it you look at your pecs and
you're like shit
shit my pecs are lopsided everyone can
tell everyone hates me
it's obvious i'm a clown i can almost
certainly promise you no one's ever
given a shit and even if they tried to
give a shit they're like um is it you're
right you're like no it's my left
okay guess it's not a big deal so make
sure it's a big deal make sure it's
notable if you want
number two okay just doing bilateral
work
tends to auto correct most asymmetry if
it ever even comes up
especially like after an injury or
something one bicep smaller than the
other but here's the thing if you do
pull ups for example
or barbell curls whichever bicep is
smaller and weaker if you position your
hands equidistantly
has to do more work fractionally
relative to its capacity
so you might be zero reps in reserve for
this bicep that's weak
and the bicep that's big and strong it's
like three reps and reserve away or five
and you figure like it's just not
getting pushed as hard right which means
this
per session just not gonna grow as much
so if you have two radically different
muscles one let's say got injured and
the other didn't
if you just continue to do normal
bilateral work and keep your balance and
push just as hard with each side
the muscles that are weaker and behind
are going to catch up because they're
getting relatively more challenged
so it's one of those things where if
you're like man you know ever since i
hurt my leg a few months ago my like
left quad has been smaller than my right
i wouldn't worry about that sort of
thing just do a good job
with bilateral training it usually just
auto-corrects right
why are we not worrying about it why not
just fix it and take time to do it
because
of number three you have to know what
you're getting in to fix it it's
months of work okay and
almost by definition it has to cap the
maximum potential of your stronger side
okay there's no way in this world and
i'm very sorry to bring your weaker side
up
to where your stronger side would be if
you just maxed it out
okay almost by definition especially if
it's a genetic limit
like your your bigger bicep is bigger
due to genetics
there's no way to make your smaller
bicep as big as your bigger bicep
without limiting the potential of your
bigger bicep because if you just let
everything go and trained your bigger
bicep the one that's gifted a little bit
more
to its max it by definition is better
genetics it would never allow the
smaller one to catch up
so you have to automatically have some
trade-off especially in time terms while
you're
fixing it and even in eventual terms of
how much do i value symmetry
perfect symmetry versus maximum
development
and if you're okay saying okay my pec
will never get bigger than the left side
pack but at least they'll be the same
size
that's totally cool and of course both
packs can grow over time
but there's gonna be a cap so as long as
you're okay with that as long as you're
paying months
of what we're gonna find out in a second
kind of meticulous training
if you're not okay with that don't do
this okay and if you're okay with it
give it a shot but know what you're
getting yourself into
all right how do you do it it's actually
a very straightforward process
first you bring your bilateral work the
work for strong and weak side at the
same time
down to maintenance volume or minimum
effective volume
and if you want to do this faster bring
it down to maintenance volume
which is very small usually one third of
the normal volume you do
something like that very tiny amount of
volume okay so your bilateral work is
like
you normally do three sets a bench
during a workout you could do you're
doing one set of bench right you
normally do
you know let's say six sets for pecs in
any one workout you're doing two sets
for pecs
for both pecs okay if you want to bring
one up versus the other
very very small amount of volume okay
because if you train your bigger side
through the normal volume landmarks
minimum effective volume to maximum
recoverable
it's just going to keep going on its own
it's like trying to catch up a slow
train to a fast train and never slowing
down the fast train
uh impossible you gotta slow down the
fast train because it's a couple miles
ahead
and speed up the slow train as much as
possible that's the only way it can work
maximum efficiency and actually pretty
sweet analogy because maintenance volume
is when your fast train stops and waits
for the slow train to catch up
means it's going to catch up pretty soon
minimum effective volume
is like the fast train is still moving
and the fast train is still moving
that means like it's still gaining some
distance now of course the slower train
will catch up eventually but like it's
gonna take longer
so the more you still try to grow both
sides the
more this is going to take and when i
describe this next part
you're not going to like the training
and you're going to think you need to do
this as fast as possible so my humble
recommendation
is to put the strong side or sorry
bilateral both sides
on maintenance volume okay so
maintenance volume for all bilateral
movements and then
you're going to take what's left because
it's maintenance volume for both right
you're going to take the weak side and
you're going to fill up its volume
with unilateral movements one arm at a
time one leg at a time whatever
from mev to mrv now the thing is don't
blindly add a ton of volume because you
could go over
mrv overreach that muscle group and get
no gains with double the work
so just start a little bit above
maintenance volume and slowly build
volume make sure you're recovering make
sure your strength is increasing
mesoderms and a meso
do a good job be wary of your mrv when
you reach it deload and go down in
volume
and meso after meso after meso mesoas
month after month after month of
training
you're going to slowly gain and gain and
gain in that weaker group and remember
the stronger group is staying relatively
stable there is a cross-training effect
with a stronger group might get a little
bit bigger
just because the nervous system
communicates to both crazy i know
but it's very small and it's not very
prominent in a very uh well-trained
muscles
so this muscle is going to stay roughly
the same size and this muscle is going
to slowly catch up catch up catch up
all right that means a lot of this
training is going to be unilateral how
do you train your pax unilaterally will
you go into the hammer strength machine
and you hold one side of the chair and
you do this it's fucking annoying
it's not that fun and then you have like
a pretty big pump in this one pack and
not a big one in the other and you're
like
i just want to even them out but
remember this one's already bigger so
evening them out means like
months of getting a pump pretty much
only in the one pack that's weak
it's weird right my recommendation is to
continue training like this until
your weaker side is notably bigger
than the stronger side than the
previously big side why
well because once you're done
and you go back to normal training that
normal training means
the smaller or the previously larger
side
was at maintenance volume for like four
months
it's so sensitized to growth and
remember also it has baller genetics to
like grow it on anyway
so but this muscle group the weak one
that you just brought up
it's like pretty exhausted and not
sensitized to growth so of course after
you're done bringing it up
take a maintenance phase or a two-week
active rest phase for both of them
really make sure this one's fresh and
then when you go back to normal training
almost inevitably the previously
stronger
now weaker side the previously smaller
now bigger side
is gonna even the odds a little bit okay
so i recommend not just
getting up to here but going overboard a
little bit so that you're like wow my
weak
pack my small pack is now my big pack
great because when you go back to just
normal training
your small formerly bigger pec is going
to renorm and get real close
if not over right you want it to just
come right up to normal okay that's
what's gonna happen
so what do you expect from this process
normally what are the expectations first
of all it will take
time it's gonna take a block or two so
we're talking about
three to five mesocycles that is three
to five four to eight week training
periods
in each block so we're talking about
this takes like half a year to a year
to really accomplish even with a mild
asymmetry okay
that's a long time of not growing both
muscles and training kind of in like a
really really weird way that usually is
not that fun
so when i said earlier like make sure
you in and committed to this
that was a serious thing right number
two
okay uh and very related you're going to
be frustrated
because you won't be able to train your
your favorite bilateral movement
someone's like hey man
you squatting today you're like no like
what what about leg press
no what are you doing for legs or like
one legged smith machine
chair squat and then one leg leg
extension one leg leg press and
someone's like
yeah that's lame and you're like i know
it's lame i hate it i want to train legs
legs and i haven't done that for six
months
that's what it takes to even those odds
right that just has to happen
here's another piece of not so great
news you have to be prepared to redo
this on occasion
why if it's genetics that's causing the
difference the stronger style will
occasionally outrun the weaker side
because it's just
better all right it's just inherently
better growing muscle so this is going
to keep re-happening
okay if it's a daily use problem or
daily use cause
it's also going to happen right even if
it's just
short-term glycogen fatigue dynamics
it's going to look like asymmetrical
until you take a real break from daily
activity and eat a bunch of carbs and
then they're going to more or less even
out
but it you have to be prepared to reduce
on occasion it is not a one-time fix now
it can fix for months and for years look
very very similar
but every now and again you're going to
have to come back every few years
probably
and renorm those muscle groups it stinks
but if you're really committed to
symmetry that
is maybe what you have to do right and
a little dose of reality you can forget
about maxing out your strong side gains
like i want both pecs to be as big as my
biggest one like
in the short term that's possible but
your biggest peck
can get enormous potentially if you just
let everything go and train at max
but your smaller pack will never be that
big so you have to be okay
with being no bigger than your weakest
side allows now weakest side allows at
its maximum genetic potential but you're
still
way bigger than you are right now that's
totally fine but there's some give and
take there
right so you can still get bigger over
time
absolutely and get huge but not untamed
side big
like imagine being like close to your
genetic peak you're like you know
39 years old and you're looking at your
biceps in the mirror like man fuck
i just wish my smaller bicep was as big
as my biggest one forget it
it's just not happening it's not
happening that's what synthol is for
i have a website that says sell synthol
we got an easy number
555 synthol
i know it's it's not the right number
numbers but it adds up
call me i answer the phone personally
we'll get you all the synthetic you need
all right so tldr what's the summary
here
asymmetry to some extent is very normal
very expected
and really honestly folks like i'm not
blowing bullshit up your
up your tail here it's there's a super
good chance only you notice it
like i'm not like trying to kindergarten
teacher you and being like you're
special in your own
way no you probably look like shit you
feel me just like me
jk but honestly it's legit something
nobody notices
okay addressing it if you want to means
slowing down overall gains for that
muscle group so make sure you're cool
with that
if you do want to fix it it's going to
take some time and you have to overshoot
your small side to weak side for a more
longer term fix which is still not
super long term because it's going to
happen again sooner or later
you've got to readdress this problem
occasionally so
if you're cool with all that okay then
you know how to fix it
but make sure you're cool with it my
recommendation is especially if you're a
beginner in intermediate
you have some small asymmetries bro
don't even sweat
just try to jack up your whole body max
that shit out
and then seven or ten years of training
in when you're jacked
then when all of your muscles are
growing pretty slowly
you can start to do more of a
symmetrical approach swear to god if you
weigh 120 pounds somebody gives a god
damn
about which pack of yours is small
motherfucker i got solve problem both of
them are small so why don't you make
both of them as big as they can
and then when you're like 165 and jacked
then you can be a little bit concerned
with balancing though
my personal advice to you folks thanks
for tuning in next time
if you want to buy stocks in the genetic
engineering military application
woodchuck farm again call that same
synthol number it's my personal number
we'll talk
