it's show time
yeah well if you take off Monday and
Tuesday my six holidays well oh that's
right yeah
please remind we have biochem lab
and the hairnet so I just
hi there you got a seat right here on
the side sure thank you
look your files and everything looks
very much an order okay this is really
easy surgery dryness is common like
letters when we come in Dave Clara's
also come
usually lasts for months it's pretty
common waiting free laser eye surgery
like
16 weeks Oh shredded
they just lifted up the cornea so that's
just naked eye they're using the laser
right now
that's ignite so the first way there was
to kind of above off or open the cornea
then they flip it open they use another
laser to shave down I think the ones
entirely sure here their manual and
lifting it up so they cut it in another
life take it up there likes prying it
open
so now although he is very working so
now they're closing it back up
including it but I'm not sure
which I think they just taped up his eye
so that's it you don't know my glasses
and I can honestly say that I'm really
glad that I had this procedure done it
was just getting to the point where you
know constantly having to wear glasses
when competing in powerlifting and when
training and you know even just simple
stuff like watching TV or having to wear
sunglasses was just so annoying for me
since you know I never actually wore
contacts so it got to the point where I
just decided that I would bite the
bullet and get the procedure done and
honestly there really was no pain at all
people been asking me how the procedure
went and it was just very simple and
straightforward since they use
anesthetic
there was really no discomfort or
anything throughout the procedure for me
and since I never wear contacts I tend
to have really sensitive eyes so if I
can do it then there's really no reason
why anyone shouldn't do it if it's
something you want to do so then for the
first week post off basically what I've
been doing is just really light pump
work in the 15 to 20 reps
just staying really clear of failure and
just going in getting a good pump
burning some calories and that's really
about it I did enjoy this break and I
basically use this as a D load as well
in my training since you know most of
the sets weren't taken past in RPE of
seven or eight really and so that's
actually going to conclude this
commentary I've got a few other videos
lined up for you guys that I think
you're really going to enjoy so stay
tuned to the channel subscribe if you
haven't already and thanks again guys
