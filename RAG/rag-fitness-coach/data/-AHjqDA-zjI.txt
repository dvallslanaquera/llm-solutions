folks
welcome to the weekly webinar good to
have you with us
dr james alcoholic and generally bad
person
dr mike much better than me in all
regards
here to answer questions
all right folks since we are now youtube
in it
and rp plus is the way of the dinosaurs
in a museum with children poking at it
let us get to the top 10 questions
from this webinar and the way we're
doing that is we go to the last webinar
which happens to be the one recorded on
july 21st
and we go through and the questions
folks ask underneath we answer
the top 10 top 10 means the top 10 most
upvoted uh and to some extent uh
some of those will also be ones that we
find most interesting and
most kind of pertinent to answering ones
that we haven't answered
before uh as much so
if you really want your question to
appear one of the weeks
ask people to upvote it uh hopefully
it's a good question
so james ready to go
yeah do you want me to start at the top
and kind of work down or what are you
thinking
you know what so i'll start with uh i
just scanned them i'm gonna start from
the bottom
and look at uh from the bottom up to see
if there's any very highly uploaded ones
there was one that was kind of low that
was like uh 12 voters
yep i saw that one so we can start there
and that's
going to be harry small
where did he go eerie fucking small he's
uh there he goes
got it yep james on your youtube what is
his uh
the h what color is that purple right
purple yeah okay cool so i can actually
just we can tell
by the pictures okay great so
harry small says hey docs what are your
thoughts on the significance of
alcohol's impact on muscle growth
jackson piazz
a good friend of ours actually recently
claimed on revive stronger podcast that
the marginal optimality relating to
retraining such as twice a day training
and face potentiation
become almost insignificant when people
are consuming alcohol weekly
you even quickly into the muscle
building process
uh so that's part one of his question um
i would say that alcohol and james and i
have
put out a lot of content relating to
this and we'll sort of re-emphasize it
right now
the effect of alcohol and muscle growth
is uh in a dose-dependent manner
and in a frequency dependent matter as
well if you drink
a beer here and there it's almost going
to impact nothing
if you drink a few beers here and there
it's going to compare like jackson
sort of insinuated to some of the other
super optimal stuff you do
and there's nothing wrong with doing
trying to do like two a day training and
also having a few drinks
because then you essentially get like
perfect one a day trading results but
you can still drink
um so that doesn't necessarily speak to
which way the trade-off should be
but if you're having four to four plus
beers
or drinks per day five days a week you
are significantly
impacting your athletic performance and
muscle growth and that is something you
need to think about incrementally more
and more
so yeah drinking does impact muscle
growth significantly but it is dose
dependent it's not like
one beer changes the game it doesn't two
beers okay starting to make an impact
three
starting to make a real impact four five
six is starting to be uh you're not
really a serious athlete
so james yeah and i think people make a
very common mathematical mistake on this
same thing with like the concurrent
training stuff where they assume that
alcohol in this case is um we're taking
away
uh giving you like negative returns
right in this case you're just getting
less positive returns
the more you drink so that means if you
could be getting a hundred percent
every time you start adding alcohol you
start shaving off little percentage
points of what potential
growth or adapt adaptations that you
could have been making so the idea here
is that you're just making less positive
gains not
making no gains or negative gains there
is a point in which you would get there
but you would likely be suffering a lot
of other life problems at that point
before you really actually started to
see like muscle loss
from alcohol uh you would your life
would very likely be in shambles at that
point
so for a variety of reasons so just keep
that in mind it's not like uh like it's
the same thing when people say like
running's gonna like crush all your
gains no it just means you're gonna have
slightly less positive gains for a
little while that's all same idea
yeah very good point number two for very
small nearing the end of a long cut my
performance in the lower up ranges
decreases which is to be expected i
suppose however the higher up range just
specifically 20 30 reps for short forms
continues to improve is this normal so
what is the reason or do you think it
could be due to the fact that with
little rep ranges you can't ride up reps
in the same way as with higher reps
so you can't continue to force
improvements so
the number one there's two big reasons
one is that
as a hypochloric diet and the added
activity people often do from cardio
though that's not required just
hypochloride general
uh increases ampk activity uh and ampk
uh activity increased as a catabolic
which is not good
but uh and is actually um makes your
ability to to exert uh so it's
catabolic and it alters your fiber
activity to a more slower twitch
from faster torch which means you're
gonna get disproportionately weaker on
heavy lifting for how much muscle you
didn't lose
so you don't lose any muscles you might
get weaker on the heavier lifts and be
like what the hell that's because you're
less fast which oriented your strength
power is down
but it'll make you better at reps so
you'll actually just get better slightly
better endurance
in addition to that so that's part one
uh a big part big part two
is you lose fat your endurance goes up
anyway a lot of the reason you think
you're stopping
since the 20 to 30 when you're fat and
happy
is your local muscles it's not it's
because your system's like go
to hell i can't keep up with this
bullshit but when you're lean your
endurance is fucking rock solid and then
your local muscles can actually be more
of a
factor which means they can do more of
the work and have higher reps so
one thing that james and i like to do is
when we're
advising progressions in a fat loss
phase we like to take advantage of the
slight conversion
and sometimes in deep at a fat loss
phase it's easier to add reps
than it is to add load um because if you
add reps you can get great progressions
going challenge yourself and at least
psychologically be like hey i'm like not
being a piece of shit and we also
usually recommend
that fat loss training definitely have a
minimum amount
of the higher uh the heavier lifting but
you can concentrate a little bit more if
you're loading into the higher rep
ranges
it's just as anti-catabolic it's just
better at doing it and it's less
likely to get you hurt and injured and
then maybe when you get back into
massing you can slowly work in
to slightly more percentage of your work
being in the heavier poundages
also like if a lot of your work when
you're massing especially towards the
tail end of massing
isn't a very very high rep ranges you
end up just kicking out every exercise
because of
aerobic fatigue and you're not even
stimulating the muscle properly like
when i'm big and fat
i could do stuff like flips like 500
pounds versus six and fucking put on
muscle
but if you happen to be lying hamstring
curls for stuff 30 i'm just like
throwing up in my mouth by the time i
get to 20 and there's i'm not even
training my hamstrings it's just my
lungs
so james anything to add there yeah so
it's kind of a funny conundrum because
it ends up being
sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy where
um as you are deeper into a diet as mike
already said systemically and locally
it becomes very difficult for you to
keep training at those high force
outputs and then it becomes more
just more efficient for you to train at
the kind of moderate to lower intensity
ranges so the first thing you run into
is
just the fact that you are now training
in those higher rep ranges when maybe
you hadn't been training in them before
automatically starts making you better
at them
just disproportionately fast and
some of those adaptations like
especially when you're training for the
higher reps
it's a lot of metabolic adaptation it's
not necessarily going to be a ton of
like muscle tissue adaptation
at least in the beginning and so you see
the acute changes happening really
really fast so you have this kind of
one-two punch of like well you haven't
really been doing that so you started
doing it because it became more
necessary and then you just started
getting better at it as a result of
doing it
so that's one of the reasons at least
why that does happens and we do as mike
said we do recommend that people buy us
the rep ranges towards the moderate and
higher rep ranges when they get further
and further into a cut
another reason why you get better at
them is because you're just doing them
more
and you've become more fatigue resistant
for a variety of other reasons like mike
already said
lastly number three uh if steps are
significantly higher than usual
on any one day should you add calories
to your daily intake
and if so how would you go about doing
this so i would say the only really good
reason to add calories
on a daily intake like that is if you
really need
to perform highly especially with your
legs the next day
and you really need to replace some of
the lost carbohydrates so then i would
say finish off the evening with a couple
of higher carb meals
and then call it good so if you walk
around like an amusement park all day
and you have to squat the day after and
you're like oh i really just want my
legs to be nice and full and get a good
workout let's say you're massing or
something
then yeah i think it's a really good
idea to finish off the night with a
couple of big
high carb meals but uh if you're any
kind of like normal plan
muscle gain maintenance fat loss
everything washes out on the average
so i wouldn't worry about daily
adjustments like that at all if you have
a few days where your steps are
significantly higher in one day
you'll probably also have a few days
that week where the steps are
significantly lower and motherfucker i
don't see
people being like oh my steps are lower
and they just take like the rice they
had on their plate and they go scoot and
they just put it in the garbage like
that's also just right right
so so if you if you're gonna add food
for that you gotta take away food for
the other and that's just nuts
eat the same food you do weekly don't
change your food any more often on
average than
than once a week and then the the steps
should you should have a um
you know if you're doing step tracking
which is clearly the case if you're
asking about step counts
then you should have a weekly average
that you type into microsoft excel or
whatever app stores for you
and then your weekly average should
almost always be right at the money and
then everything else washes off
actually i'm glad this question came up
because i'm actually dealing with this
issue right now and
i think you'll see why i'm doing it the
way i'm doing it um i'm so i was talking
to dr mike before uh we started and i uh
some of you know i got two puppies
and if you've ever had puppies before
you know that they are just like pee
machines they just pee all the time you
don't sleep it's very hard so i've been
in like a really foul mood and i've been
sleep deprived for a few weeks and today
i got up this morning i had my like
break where the puppies were down to go
train
and i was supposed to do squats uh you
know uh 315 for sets of like 10. the
first set should have been 10 like
without
much without really having to get super
psyched up for it i got under there i
did
six for like i just grinder and i was
and i was like dude no fucking way this
is happening today and uh so
i just i can tell that like my fatigue
is in a really bad state just because i
haven't been sleeping and i've been
running around with the dogs and dealing
with all that stuff so i've actually
been slow i'm gonna slowly start
increasing my calories
and so i thought about that this morning
and i went and double checked my weight
and my weight was actually
way down from what it should have been i
should have been around like 217. i've
been i'm not like 213 right now so
i had the combination of like bad
workout performance body weight is
trending in a kind of negative way
uh and so now i'm going to increase my
calories just to kind of combat the
fatigue state that i'm in but i'm not
training
you know like i'm not in a normal
training situation i'm in like a shitty
situation but that is an instance where
you might consider doing something like
this when you have outside circumstances
but i think like dr mike said for the
most part it's a wash if you're under
normal training circumstances
the averages are what you're working
with and i like your point about people
not
not when they're stepping not taking
food away that's really funny
all right next up we're going to scroll
up a couple from that james and we're
going to look at
michelle marinovich got it
he says hey docs where would you
incorporate top singles and power
lifting
uh hypertrophy strength peaking mesos
wouldn't top singles be in violation of
direct adaptation of first two phases
so not in violation but definitely
not on remember it's a spectrum right we
say in violation
we do we do say that and it's fine to
say the answer fundamentally is yes
but just for a little bit more nuance
maybe it's not like violation but it's
like it's not like not the greatest
thing in the world
and uh maybe we would say it also is
needs to be justified
because people always ask us like hey
can i do singles here and and then we
ask them back like
why and they're like because i like them
like can you do any better than that
and they're like no like okay well maybe
you could do better than that because at
the end of the day
totally whatever you total on the
platform is cool and it's cooler than
being able to tell someone
after you totaled your second place
total and turning you
to them and be like yeah but i really
like my motorcycle that i did like sweet
you're the man here's the
the award no one gives you for liking
what you've been doing like
you know and unless that's cool with you
then it's fine right so
is it a violation of direct adaptation
the first two phases yeah to some extent
it is
why a lot of top power lifters train
with heavy singles almost all year long
and not just peaking phases because
numerically there are a lot of people
uh that train in not an optimal way
and uh but percentage-wise the number of
people like that are
lower uh also a lot of the folks at the
very top have already built all the
muscle they pretty much need
and can work on technical expression
also a lot of those folks are instagram
junkies and they do
maxes all the time for the gram so uh
and
maybe you see a small part of their
training where they do
uh heavy singles and uh you don't see a
whole lot of the other training and
a lot of times again they don't really
do heavy singles they do moderately
heavy singles just to get a little bit
of weight on their back and it's not
like an rp
9 or 10 single it's like an rp7 single
and they do a single just to practice
singles because that's their sport which
is totally fine you can always do that
we just don't want people to do very
heavy singles all the time that's a
really bad idea
so most of the top power lifting coaches
don't have people do heavy singles
sometimes they have them do moderate
singles and most
of the time they don't have too many
singles at all and a lot of the top
power lifters is like if you looked at
all the top power lifters you would find
that
not so many of them do uh top and heavy
singles
and also used to be that everyone did
singles all the time
it was west side training and that's
what almost all power lifters did that
was wrong
and now we know that there's better ways
to train that are more submaximal and
more repetition-based
in 10 or 20 years maybe even fewer
people will do top heavy singles so you
don't want to exactly copy what the best
guys do because they could already be
out of date
just writing a log on amazing genetics
and drugs
yeah absolutely sing i mean doing
singles is for uh
peaking phases and for tinder as far as
i'm concerned about as you did there
um yeah so i think what dr mike was
saying too um
a lot of people do it for it's basically
like an mv for their technique under
heavy load which is actually not a
terrible idea
but at that point they're not doing like
a true single it's not like a 90
effort single what they're doing is like
a something they could do for like a
three or a five right and then they're
just really just keeping that technique
under heavy load nice and crisp so that
when they actually get back to training
heavy
it's not as big of a shock or they don't
have as much transition time from their
other techniques
so i think that's a perfectly fine way
of going about it but people who are
taking like
like actual like ninety percent or like
you know rpe
910 singles during their hypertrophy
phases or even during their strength
phases to some degree
it's probably not the best use of their
time or effort for sure
all right did you get a text from
someone jamie
yeah sorry i'm not i'm on some weird
spam list
oh geez all right scrolling up to
cushion one three
between the magenta
l of lucas wernick and the purple jf
john
got it all right cushion one three says
if i'm on an upper lower split doesn't
matter if i purchase
you change the order of the days from
week to week as long as i get four
workouts in every week
i.e week one i do on on off on
on but next week i do one on and one off
uh it doesn't matter a ton as long as
you can checklist
the two things one
is your workout that you do is there
enough
of a rest after it to make sure that
you're really fueling gains
as opposed to just hitting it hard again
and two is your next workout
done sufficiently fresh that you're not
like weak and sore
from the last workout you did if those
two things are correct
ninety percent of the concern is gone
and any arrangement works
fairly well james so this is what yeah
like i
agree with dr mike here this is one of
those things where like if you really
pressed me hard i'd have to i'd have to
concede that it's not a big deal
though it is kind of a pet peeve of mine
so i'd be more of a stickler on that and
say
it's very difficult to track what you
are doing when you have that much
inconsistency and variation in your
weekly schedule
so it's very difficult to know like if
you did one workout and then the next
time you do it in a completely different
circumstance different day different
time different conditions
was this an rp or was my ri r2 was it
one did i match reps did i not match
reps it's very hard to like actually
make a good judgment call on those
things when the conditions are when they
differ greatly
so in that regard i'm not i i would not
want any of my athletes or clients or
anybody to do that
but like i said if you really pressed me
i'd say yeah it's probably not a huge
deal so long as you're able to hit your
your main workout criteria and you're
trained for hypertrophy
i think it would be a bigger deal if you
were doing more sporting type activities
which were more
intensity dependent like if you had to
hit certain numbers on your lifts if you
had to
do certain performance uh milestones
that you had to hit during your training
that might be a bigger deal but for
hypertrophy i think it's a little bit
more forgiving
[Music]
comically frozen james oh yeah oh okay
all right and then second part of
cushion one three's question
is also if i want to consume one gram of
protein per pound of body weight i weigh
170 pounds put a casein shake before bed
count towards that day's daily protein
or the next
so it takes several hours to fully
absorb uh i
answer that very simply you should count
it to that day because you consumed it
on that day
you can count on them to the next days
but then you'd have to count the next
casein shake that
night after on the next and let's say
instead of casey and you decide to go
out with your friends and have two
cheeseburgers that's the same amount of
protein do you got the cheeseburgers you
ate
friday night for saturday no that's
ridiculous so
count it for the day and that's uh super
super straightforward
yeah it's needlessly complicated you
don't gain anything by making it more
complicated
at that point all right next up
is just above that and that is
our friend john
who has the greatest just john ever just
fucking john i can't believe he got that
one
um he says or asks if someone is an
advanced
quote-unquote power lifter can they
experience newbie gains when switching
to a hypertrophy program
no as a matter of fact advanced power
lifters who have been let's say lifting
very heavy and not doing hypertrophy
they've been doing for a long time
enough so that they're getting very few
gains very slowly
uh when they switch to hypertrophy
program nine times out of ten they're
going to get temporarily weaker
because the neurological adaptations are
so wildly different and the fatigue is
so much wildly higher
that they're going to be like oh my god
like this is making me weaker but they
will add muscle relatively quickly
so they're initially going to get worse
then
later when they start to do heavier
training again and stop doing the
lighter training
they stop doing as much hypertrophy work
and switch more to strength work
especially if they transition well
with intermediate reps and even if they
don't it should go back to super heavy
lifting
they're going to start to catch these
mysterious gains out of nowhere they
won't be newbie games but they will be
like intermediate games
so uh james anything to add to that i
think it's
you know the intermediate way is kind of
a decent way of putting it yeah i know
you're spot on so the thing with um like
the beginner games is you can you can
you can kind of branch off and look at
different modes of exercise and
different activities and break these
things up so a really
a really simple example is that if you
have a soccer player right if they've
been lifting for
six years you know doing good
intelligent lifting their lifting
training age is
like an intermediate right but if
they've been playing soccer for 20 years
that means in the soccer context they're
advanced so you can break it up a little
bit depending on what the mode is the
problem in this case
is the mode of resistance training is
the same for power lifting and for
hypertrophy training so
the the way that you're doing it is
slightly different and so like dr mike
said you're going to get a little bit
more out of it
um but not not beginner gains yeah so i
think the intermediate analogy was
really good
[Music]
all right let's go all the way up to the
second to last
to abraham lincoln like lincoln park
oh very nice play on words all right
abraham lincoln says question in the
context of training for powerlifting
how big of a difference of results can
one expect from doing a mini cut
versus maintenance versus slight surplus
during a strength phase
for any for say around an 8 to 12 week
long strength block for long term
progress
this is a contrast to the latter having
two dedicated blocks at one point though
idk
to bring body fat to more optimal levels
to start in the math and massing phase
while the mini cut has saved four to six
weeks on the form so in the context of
powerlifting how big
difference results don't expect from
doing a mini cut versus maintenance
versus a slight surplus
during a strength phase for say okay so
is he asking like
the performance differences that we
would expect to see across those
conditions like i i'm not really
understanding the question i guess
i'm wondering if he's saying like oh i
suppose
powerlifting performance suffer
so i think yeah okay so i think he's
saying a mini cut versus like a regular
cut
uh essentially um like he's clarifying
here so
in my case i find that many cuts of 4-6
weeks are usually plenty to get me back
into a reasonable body i've had to start
massing and have up to this point been
doing them during my strength phases but
i wonder if maybe i'm limiting my
long-term progress by doing this i don't
think you're limiting your long-term
progress
but i think that uh we don't recommend
mini cuts for our strength athletes
because the deficit is so large
that it takes your strength performance
and strength momentum a lot
i think what's better for strength
athletes for physique athletes that's
fine
i think for strength athletes you want
your momentum to keep going
so a longer sort of uh
six to ten week diet uh that is slower
in uh lower lower and it's you know
weekly deficit and so on and so forth
can allow you to still get decent
strength progress and then get to the
same body fat and then it can allow you
to slow mass or maintain
after that have great great training it
never disrupts your training there's a
momentum
to strength building and conservation
and power lifting that is very important
to medium term progress maybe maybe long
term
and by that i mean like for your next
meat for example like for your next meat
that's coming up in 16 weeks should you
do a regular cut
or should you do a mini cut if you do a
mini cut sometimes you get like
objectively weaker
um and sometimes a mini cup alters your
leverages so quickly
and it gives you such low energy so
quickly that you
have to drop a lot of load off the bar
that screws up your progressions
and it can really fuck you
psychologically too and then you have to
rebuild strength it's really gnarly
what i'd rather see is a more
conventional fat loss phase that takes a
little longer
six to ten weeks where you have like
really good training but not the best
training ever
but you lose fat and you keep your
momentum it's just slower momentum so
instead of
let's say spotting 405 for fives
if you start a mini cut you might be
i would rather see startup 405.5 due to
the 10-week
the end of that or can you still hear me
james
uh i was it was it was kind of coming in
and out okay
i fucking i hate the internet i love the
internet i'll take that back
no it's it's not it's it's almost
certainly on my end so
you're probably you know what i mean
okay
so um yeah okay after six to ten weeks
you only went up
from 405 to like 410 or something like
that or maybe 415
but like that's still momentum you're
building and then when you switch to a
muscle gain or maintenance
then you add an ad and add an ad so
you're like a really really good place
versus if you're in a mini cup taking
those like two steps backward to kind of
take
two steps forward that's kind of rough
it can be pretty rough
and then it's just more mini cuts are
again
even if you manage to regain that
strength there's a little bit of
perilousness
involved in altering your leverages that
much and that quickly
and you're not used to it and it's
really day-to-day you have really shitty
energy
we basically like james and i approach
uh athletic performance differently than
we
see if you feel like shut the fuck up
just grind the wraps
if you can't get to add more sets in
performance sport
you don't this is something because
james and i come from a coaching
background literally coach performance
athletes
you just don't want to do anything to
really fuck with their performance
especially making it objectively worse
if you slow down the gains that's way
better than making it objectively worse
because number one they're there to have
good training
and from a coaching perspective like if
i was coaching powerlifters and i had
them do mini cuts dude i would lose all
my fucking clients because i'd be like
i'm getting weaker go fuck yourself
they would fire me and maybe they're
making the wrong decision i don't think
they are but it's still from an athlete
perspective
it's tough to have like imagine you have
worlds coming up for nationals
someone's like how you're lifts going
they're like well i'm in mini cuts
they're falling right now but but
they'll be back up like
yeah if that was a potentiated
calculated trade-off that'd be cool but
if it's not
it's just too extreme of a thing for
strength athletes to be doing from a
variety of perspectives we're
bigger fans of just a slower slow roll
approach
yeah i don't definitely agree and i
think this really highlights the
importance of
you know weight class athletes to to
really be on point with their body
composition and their body weight
because you don't want to be fucking
around with doing all this cut stuff all
the time
and having shitty training and seeing
your performance go down this is
something that drives
you know it drives me nuts and i'm sure
it drives dr mike and just about
everybody who's coached anyone before
where they're like
oh i got this important me coming up
it's the most important thing but i need
to drop
like 30 pounds it's like you fat fuck
what are you talking about you need to
drop 30 pounds you're way overweight
we're talking like
tissue weight not water weight right
like you're just way out of shape at
that point
so the idea being like when you have
your um a weight class sport like power
lifting
you really got to stay kind of pretty
close to your competition
uh body composition and body weight
within some like pretty tight boundaries
more so than a lot of other sports
because
you can't afford to spend a ton of time
massing and getting really really sloppy
and then having to spend all this time
cutting at a really really slow pace
so i think what a lot of people do is
they do a shitty job on their mass
blow up bigger than they're supposed to
be and then they think oh i'll just do
something
and i'm not this i'm not saying this is
a jo whoever asked this question i'm not
saying this is you
um but then people will be like oh i
need to lose all this weight really fast
what about a mini cut it's like
the point is actually to just not get
that fat in the first place so you don't
have to have this problem
that's the real issue yes 100
all right coming down just a little bit
one question down
some dude norris really not chuck norris
i feel like some dude norris is getting
two questions answered on this webinar
because one's rated seven and one's
rated nine so that's like
yeah so that's really good keep it up
all right
something says i've never thought these
claims admired to them but there are
those that swear by it
think about old school bodybuilding
techniques meant to grow your rib cage
like breathing pullovers and squats
james why don't you start off this one
so i've heard this too
i can't imagine that there's any merit
to this outside of like being at like a
developmental age where
maybe and this is like a big maybe you
might be able to expand your rib cage a
little bit but we're talking about like
bones here right and so the other
question is like
what is the purported benefit of this
like why would you want to have an
expanded like
trunk cavity i don't understand what the
especially for bodybuilding that doesn't
seem like it would make any sense
whatsoever
so i honestly i don't i think it's
bullshit
i don't really have any good insight
though mike what do you think
um i i don't understand how that would
ever fucking work bro
like what what is what are you supposed
to get out of it even if it did work you
know what i mean like what is the goal
to make your fucking ribs bigger
this isn't like this isn't like fucking
mad men where you can be like
the more barrel chested you are the
tougher you are you know what i mean
like
come on yeah kind of i mean and yeah i
guess if your rib cage was really big
then you would be bigger but also then
it would be awkward because your
shoulder clap inter intra acromial width
would be the same
and then you kind of look like you have
a big barrel chest but narrow shoulders
and it wouldn't be a great look
so it'd be be great for for like big
belly benching
and power lifting yeah or like being an
old-timey circus strong man
yeah yeah it would be terrible for like
mma because you'd have this like giant
target of of body that people could just
tee off on yeah
[Laughter]
all right some dude norris next question
uploaded
a lot says i know you recommend a lower
gothic spine for hip hinging that works
very well with me for rdl but for good
warning and sldl
sldl and rd are the same but that's not
here no there my erectors fail before
hams or glutes i found a neutral spine
and an intense power lifting style brace
allows me to feel more tension in the
hamstrings despite feeling less of a
stretch
uh when determining best sfr i am
assuming feeling tension will be
prioritized or feeling a stretch yes or
no yes it would be
but also why don't you just go lower and
get both so
whatever you're doing to brace here's
what james and i
will say if you can keep your spine
relatively straight
and you can get your hips to do the work
instead of your back
then you're fucking golden we're not
going to judge you after that so we're
not going to say you got to be lord i
can stick your chest out like a fucking
dying parrot but like yeah just like
keep your shit tight like if your back
is fucking actively rounding and you
think you're doing good mornings you're
not
so if you're getting plenty of uh
flexion at the hip not
the spine and if you're getting uh if
your knees are nice and back so you get
a good stretch
if you feel lots of tension in the
hamstrings but not as much of a stretch
in that position
that means your pelvis isn't anteriorly
tilted as much as it could be that's
okay
just go deeper and it'll accomplish the
same thing so just go deeper and you
have your
both answers at the same time so this
this i'm giving you like the double
stink eye on this one some dude norris
apologies in advance so i'm just having
a hard time so like if your erectors
aren't a limiting factor on
rdl i have a really hard time imagining
that like the
switch to sldl or good morning then
suddenly they are
that seems really odd i just it would
make me wonder
what exactly you're doing to see that
vast of a difference i mean like the
good morning should
should be lighter in weight first of all
so like it would seem odd that that
would become a limiting factor for good
morning
uh when you your
your rdl seems fine so that seems a
little strange to me and then
i understand it's definitely feasible to
feel
more tension through the muscle while
not necessarily feeling more stretch
but at the same time that's seems a
little
a little hard to pull off more often
than not and so i think dr mike's
recommendation right there was
did the zoidberg why not both why not
zoidberg um definitely go for both
um but i kind of that that gives me like
a little stink eye like well if you
you're feeling tension but no stretch
that again
those things combined make me very
skeptical of your technique
that's kind of really the root of the
issue so both of those things make me
kind of giving you a little stink eye
but yeah i mean it is possible to feel
tension and not a ton of stretch but i
would
try to get both like mike said
[Music]
all right next up is
our friend from brazil down a few nights
green r raphael
he had a good one last week about the
copy bars
yeah that was amazing
so rafael says master mike and master
james i heard you guys saying that
stretch under load is independent
way of hypertrophy but uh
uh so easy stretch under load can be
used in almost every exercise
some especially more than others by
going through a full range of motion
and pausing at the deep stretch position
for a split second so stiff legged
deadlift good morning
dumbbell fly uh pull-ups even
um all kinds of full range of motion
movements especially with dumbbells and
especially with barbells that let you go
super super deep
uh that's stretch under load so
stretching or load isn't something
it is seemingly an independent uh
hypertrophic mechanism or
it allows you to essentially impose
tension in a very very intense way
in a particular way that's very
hypertrophic then we're not really
saying that that needs to be a different
thing
it doesn't mean like oh interest rate
stretching or something like that it
should be a part of your repertoire and
is more
reasoning to do full range of motion
that's really what it is
it's like hey why should i do full range
of motion well here's a good start
this is why so that's that's one of the
reasons we say that james
yeah and this is just like mike said
this isn't something you have to add
it's just something
that is already covered in full range of
motion training and
there were some other programs back in
the day it was just like with the s fst
7 with
like power stretching in between like
that's not like you don't have to do
that kind of stuff really it's just like
can you move through a full range of
motion under control feeling tension
through the muscle my muscle connection
all those things
boom check mark done
all right
[Music]
we got two more i think all right perry
battles
uh has also a sweet name perry battles
he's got some kind of mentally retarded
man on his logo or whatever
all right harry battle says hi doctors
mike and james how necessary slash
manufacturers are active rest phases for
intermediate trainees i've heard dr mike
say active breastfeeds or superior to
maintenance phases
in many cases because they drop the same
amount of fatigue or greater
for more structure specifically
connective tissue in less time than a
four week maintenance phase
would that being said i've also heard it
said pardon me i forget where that the
active rest phase is not really as
useful for intermediates
would you therefore preferentially
recommend maintenance phases to
intermediate lifters over active
respaces
thanks as additional loader we
appreciate your work it's helped me a
lot of my training and my studies well
that's very good uh perry thank you so
much
or whatever the fuck your real name is
um but uh
so i would look at it from
uh james here this is a needs analysis
situation it's not like an intermediate
versus other people
it's like what do you need right now if
you are going to be maintaining
your dietary intake anyway not either
massing or cutting
and you need to train still and you need
to maintain
for eight weeks because that's how much
time you need to take off for massive
cutting for your metabolism and
everything in psychology to get back to
normal so you can do that shit again
then you're not gonna have to rest for
eight weeks that's for goddamn sure
uh so you're gonna do a maintenance
phase so maintenance phase is something
you can do to draw fatigue and to
resensitize for hypertrophy
mostly the latter not the former um when
you are not specifically gaining or
losing uh
mass uh weight or muscle and fat and so
on and so forth
so and some of those maintenance periods
can last a while that's where
maintenance training is irreplaceable
uh in addition maintenance training
seems like a real good idea for
beginners
because they don't really need active
rest because they're not burnt out
and uh there's not much damage going on
and they could still
work on their technique a lot get
stronger and that is something that the
maintenance phase is really really good
for them and also maintenance space is
great for them because it keeps them in
the training habit
so you don't want to just let beginners
off the hook for two weeks because it's
just never come back right so
for that maintenance phase is good but
for intermediates in advanced
it is do i need to train for a long time
and not gain or lose weight
and if the answer is no but i need to
draw some fatigue and i feel like i can
do it in two weeks with an active rest
phase then an active rest phase is
superior to a maintenance phase so for
example
if you get to a certain point in your
diet and you need
to take a break but like uh so here's a
good example um
you've done a fat loss phase and you're
pretty beat up
but like you can go right into massing
after but you're really fucking beat up
do you do a four week maintenance phase
no because like why the fuck are you
maintaining a lower body fat and all
that's kind of fucking stupid
you don't need to be there for four
weeks you could just turn around so
they're an active rest space is a great
idea you do two weeks of active rest and
you're fucking golden you're good to go
um whereas a maintenance phase is
something like you know you just did
a diet that was really really hardcore
and uh you're interested in doing
another diet later that's pretty
hardcore like fat loss diet
well you know two week active rest is
not enough time to give you a break
between two diets back to back
so you're gonna take maybe an eight week
maintenance phase
with maybe an active rest at the end of
one of those like a one week active rest
at the end of that last maintenance
phase
and then you're gonna do your next fat
loss diet and that's because you need
the time
james yeah i think that's a great answer
i'm gonna come at it from a slightly
different perspective um i think
at the intermediate stage you have kind
of a combination of two things that are
occurring that you know like the athlete
has
gained a lot of training experience but
they still need some guidance at the
same time from their coach or whomever
they're working with
right and so to really get to that
advanced stage
whether it's sport training or
hypertrophy training or anything
eventually the athlete has to
gain more incrementally more and more
and more autonomy over their own
training programs and their own
decisions
so i think at the intermediate stage
we're probably going to see
the coaching style and the relationship
with the athlete really determining
whether or not they need like a
maintenance face aside from the factors
that dr mike already mentioned
um whether they do maintenance phase or
an active rest phase so when you have
athletes who
you're trying to build their confidence
and autonomy with the program or
whatever it is that you're doing
you might opt for active rest face
because it puts the ball in their court
and allows them to make some more
decisions about where their
life is going whereas in other
situations you might say like
coach knows best you're going to just
trust me on this one we're going to do a
maintenance phase i just need you to
chill for a couple minutes like a mezzo
or two
et cetera so i think at this point um
you have your needs analysis decisions
and then you also have kind of like your
interpersonal relationships with
between the coach and the athletes and
making good decisions about the
the athletes future but also the rapport
between the two so i think
the active rest can be useful when
you're trying to you know build up the
athlete to becoming more and more
independent and making better decisions
on their own
and the intermediate is like right in
between right they're like they have
some experience but not enough yet to
make those good decisions so the coach
is what is who helps them kind of decide
which ones are better choices
yep james would you like to answer
the last question about oh my
slow versus watch fast twitch
determination
versus watch
uh where is this one i don't see it so
this is
at epilemos for life he has one question
there is another
rated question that's our dilo's always
at our p6 every session of that week or
would you like to answer
um
question of uh dieting in a deficit and
strength training versus hypertrophy
training which one of those
suits your fancies it's our last
question oh hold on okay so there was
determining if you're fast or slow
twitch yeah
versus strength training on a cut
versus what rpe do we do have a d load
let's do uh rpe on the d load because i
feel like we've already
touched on those other ones so
rd loads uh plemos for life uh down
below lucas wernick
um he's basically like his picture looks
like jesus christ
um our d loads always he's almost
certainly like a norwegian
death metal artist 100 or a huge fan
uh our d loads always in rp6 every
session
of that week so grain of truth is that
they're no higher than rpe6
the it really just sort of depends on
how you measure rpe
so if you're measuring session rpe which
is actually very difficult to do
um then yes rp6 or lower
we actually prefer an average of rp5 or
below like rp6 is already getting into
that
realm of like the rp6 is something in
the gray area between things that
are not adding fatigue and things that
are adding fatigue and stimulus rp7
you could train at rp7 again games rp6
is like
um rp5 is like super easy so it actually
like for sessions we'd actually
i actually probably recommend below our
p6 rp6 is just in that
border line of like yeah you really play
this hard now you could do an rp6
session or series of sessions early in
the week and then later in the week do
an rp 4 or three series of sessions and
then you're fucking
really good to go um as far as lifts
though
there are lifts if you know are because
you're using rp then we're talking power
lifting here or weightlifting or
straight sports not hypertrophy because
then we just use rir
um can you do lifts in your d-load that
are rp6 yeah you can do rp7 and eight
lifts it just has to be very few of them
and they have to probably be earlier in
the week but as far as you're looking at
sessions
it's like look let's say you do and this
is again why session rpe is a bit of a
dubious measure
session rps work for like uh team sport
athletes and other people like soccer
players that
have to give you one feedback on like
they don't do very distinct things in
their training it's all a bunch of stuff
mixed together and then it's an hour of
that and it's like how did you feel
right but for powerlifting let's say you
did an
rpe eight squat like that's pretty
fucking hard right
but like you did two rp8 singles did a
set of
like extensions at rp4 and then went
home
what is that session rpe even if you
didn't do the leg extensions rp4 you
just did two squats
at rp8 is that session really rp8
well compared to all the other sessions
you've done in your accumulation phase
motherfucker that's like an rp3
like you just warmed up essentially and
went home so
i don't like the session rpe idea for
strength sports a ton
but i think the lifts within your
session uh
can be quite high rpe i would say that
anything over
eight rpe is really begging the question
what the fuck you're doing with it on
your d-load
so i think even the six seven and eight
rpe lifts are fine
lifts as long as the session overall is
a very very low volume
and later in the week you should be
doing rp even the lift should be rp
five and below james yeah that was good
that was the direction i was going to go
as well so in strength and power sports
you might have activities on your d-load
like a sprint for example where it's
like
uh can you sprint at like an rpe like
six or you know it's like yeah it's not
really a sprint that's like a run at
that point right so
there's just some activities like
powerlifting weightlifting you know
track and field events come to mind
where yeah you just can't get around
that but as mike said the point is that
the session as a whole is much much much
easier right so there might be a few
individual components within your deload
where you had a couple like kind of hard
or just intense
things that you were doing whether it
was the weight on the bar or the amount
of effort that you put into it
but overall you should walk away from
that feeling like oh that was
nothing i'm feeling better 100 james
my count might be off and i'll be
getting better at counting i switched
counting methods halfway through but i
believe that's ten questions that if
it's nine we'll do 11 next time or some
shit but i think that's it
all right well guys thank you very much
for joining us on a new format we
appreciate the engagements there's like
50 comments on that last one
so that's really awesome so we're really
glad that you guys are engaged and
hanging out with us and listening to our
nonsense
so same format for next time this one
will get published
and hopefully in a couple days and then
you can start posting in
your questions or uploading questions
that you like and we're going to take
the top 10
most interesting ones or most upvoted
ones from there
lastly before we go guys um
when you post your question our huge
recommendation
is do this post your question if you
want like your own question or know if
you're allowed to do that but if you are
great
like at least two or three other
questions and not just randomly
go through them and see which ones you
like and
that way it's going to be really good
because even if your question doesn't
get answered you get a little some
don't just post your question and let
the mob like the questions because
you'll be perennially disappointed with
which questions are getting answered
it's never fucking yours right
so uh like a couple of the top questions
as well as your own
and then um you know that way
we can make sure that you know we get
good data on really upvoted questions
and then answer those so that's that and
it might be good not to drop a bomb load
of questions
per per post like somebody today posted
several separate questions that got
masked and got both of them answered
and i think it's one of those where if
you post like a big bomb knowing
everyone's gonna ignore you
yeah for sure if you ask like 50
questions and and also
that we reserve the right to like if you
ask 10 questions or one question we're
just going to move on to somebody else
because like
it's one technically speaking folks it's
one question per question
uh we could just answer one part of your
question we usually answer most parts if
it's like two or three parts that's
totally cool
but like motherfucker if you put like uh
who did that shit let's call him out
real quick
oh no our friend from lithuania
uh is six distinct questions now mine
says i know
motherfucker i know you want to know
shit and you're a sharp guy but like
let's widow that down to three and we'll
be on that shit like white on rice and
he got a lot of upvotes he got seven
upvotes he should have been in our
account today
but like god damn man let's win all
those down like next time what else down
to the three you want to answer the most
we'll kick him off and then next time
ask another three or some shit but seven
is like intense and that's like
it's not like we're bothered with it we
have we have the time it's just like
it's kind of
not i don't know unfair it's a weird
term but like it's kind of weird
we're answering your questions bad form
answering seven of your questions and
then we don't even get to some of the
people who asked just one question and
weren't uploaded
so yeah yeah and maybe post if like a
couple of those separately as because
they might be people might be like oh
yeah fuck yeah that one
boom yeah oh and one question i i'm not
going to answer the actual question but
it's the same question real quick i have
to get to
and uh hopefully we'll answer your
question next time uh farhan where is
so he's asking i i said earlier that his
name sounds like a russian curse word
um and it's like it doesn't sound
exactly like one but it sounds like like
which is just a way of saying your name
and putting vagina in it
uh it's like it's like you see like a
like a swedish guy's name is like pussy
ostroff and you're like
okay like don't grow up in america with
that name because god damn so if you
grew up in russia
chances are russian assholes would you
know say
unkind things to you your entire life
until you became an adult and then they
would say them behind your back
russia's great right well it's like
imagine growing up in america if you're
like people that grew up with a name
like dick like i don't even know how
that works like dick cheney like
clearly he must have gone by richard
when he was a kid this is no fucking way
can you imagine like your mom like you
forget your lunch and you're walking
through your neighborhood to school with
the other kids your mom's like dick you
forgot your lunch like
mom are you serious richard please don't
say dick please for the love of god
stop calling me dick
[Music]
folks don't name your kids stupid things
and with that we'll see you next time
