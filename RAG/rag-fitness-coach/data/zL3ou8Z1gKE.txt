hey folks check this out we have someone
to introduce to you
this is amanda now a side note i thought
she looked like a lindsay but allegedly
her name is amanda which is a fine
american name how are you i'm doing well
excellent you're about to be doing
slightly less well yes because you have
a hell of a competitive history you used
to be a crossfitter yep and then a power
lifter yep and you decided you wanted
balance in your life so you chose
wellness which is the opposite of
balance opposite of family lower body
lower body more lower body literally
literally and you are here to do a leg
workout with us yes and we are going to
do the compound leg workout of doom i
was on your side i was like let's do
something easy she seems like a nice
girl jared on the other hand said what
jared you said we're gonna do
one squat or one one squat rack one
workout one squat rack one workout one
woman one voice one people one nation
one world
let's get it done
[Music]
all right
let's see how you squat is it okay if we
make some technique suggestions sure all
right
just kidding
she's
very good beautiful she even does the
doctor mike hip tilt all right so
exercise number one is relatively heavy
squats
oh
somewhere between 5 and 15 reps i know
that's a big range but we'll feel into
it see how she's feeling ideally we want
lots of sets of like eights and tens
enough to get lots of volume and a
decent pump but also a gnarly tension
stimulus
always good technique
three sets of this after extended
warm-up of course and then we move on to
other stuff after let's go to work
easy
[Music]
five
let's get down there
oh yeah
six keeping the quads let's go
[Music]
there it is much better good ship big
chest
squats big chest quads
one more get it together take a break
breathe here come on let's go
quads make it hard on yourself drive up
drive drive up
drive up
good stop
all right have a seat relax
good stuff that was excellent technique
never broke down yeah it was perfect
four phenomenal
warm now give me the class let's go
make it hard on yourself
pop up six chests in the bottom
deep big chest at the bottom let's go
quads quads quads up one more get it
together let's go amanda
up up up
good job
good chest come on good give him the
point one more two more
you got it you're done
 with chest quads
watch pause one more let's get it
together
[Music]
um
just the bar for good morning warm up
okay
[Music]
good morning class good morning mr
campbell you guys remember that
kindergarten cop amazing movie if you
haven't seen kindergarten cop
pause stop
get out open up a new tab amazon prime
pay the money kindergarten pop amazing
film however good mornings they target
the hamstrings and the glutes and the
lower back and actually a lot of the
adductor complex they are phenomenal
they are better if
you can keep your back completely tight
and reach back with your butt putting
tension on the hams and your knees can't
go this and they can't go that
we are super lucky to have amanda
training with us today because her
technique is something that literally we
say this about almost no one because
almost no one qualifies is almost
picture perfect
enjoy we're going to do three sets
relatively heavy good mornings
and i present to you flawlessness i'm
trying to get your glutes to touch the
upper corner of the back wall so you're
going pushing them back but the glutes
go up
big stretch
better oh yeah more
all day all day come on
reach back reach back yes press that
back wall upper tension gentle
up
good one more last one coming up it's
just low back
reach
reach
reach back
gentle easy come on up adjustment just
oh my god unbelievable
that cue makes sense yeah
you know what i'm saying you're not just
reaching back like you're literally
thinking about you're flipping your ass
overhead so i just say you're touching
the upper back corner of that wall when
you do your good mornings because then
that gives the cue of okay don't bend my
knees so much on the way back that's a
good q jared yeah you're trying to put
your butthole into the corner yeah and
the upper back corner yeah i've done a
lot of things in my butthole over the
years
chest big chest big chest slow
up fast
beautiful two mornings forever this
might be your last one last two make
sure your hips are open so knees when
you go down open open open
open hips hips
a little harder a little harder big
chest
one more one more one more
good technique just like jared said
reach that butt reach hips open
there you go yes
beautiful beautiful beautiful
one more set
will your hamstrings recover if we do
one more
yeah serious question
yeah very good very good very good
so there's all different spots when you
open your hips like that yeah yeah for
sure
that's the last thing you really got to
fix on most people like your technique's
flawless and then the last thing is just
really forcing those hips open
press your back
you know jared like all the technique
yes that
i preach you like you took it to the
next level
yeah
because i'm i'm always preaching really
good basic technique but then you took
the basic and you like
added in some very high quality nuanced
actual biomechanics yeah well i don't
know about that
um
it's kind of cool
you know like you know i think that
stuff if you agree doesn't matter that
much but it matters enough to be
worthwhile oh for sure if your basics
are in line if your bases are in line
exactly that's right that's why i don't
worry about it it's worthwhile right
yeah exactly
keep the tension on the hams even at the
bottom
good fight those hips open knees open
knees open
good stuff good stuff just gently keep
your knees a little bit further back
more tension on the hams
stop he's back a little oh
yes
and up
oh yeah let's go
keep those knees back just a little just
like last time
more hams
chest open knees
[Music]
dude there it is holy crap i felt that
one yeah damn good
so got the heavy squats out of the way
got the good mornings out of the way we
need more quad volume and probably more
glute volume we can get it through
squats however
our well amanda's lower back mid back
are going to be a little bit of a
limiting factor now because of all the
good mornings so how do we leverage the
squat to be less back dominant or less
constrained by the back and more quad
dominant
check that out
we put tiny little plates so she already
has weight lifting shoes her heels are
going to be even more elevated she's
going to stay even more upright we're
going to probably take her stance in
just a tiny bit and it's going to be a
tom platt style
weightlifting quad squat sets of 10 to
15 here
four sets
brutality commences
now
her reactions like
now
yeah the easy thing to do to lift the
most weight is to do this which is cool
it's good yeah but because you have the
heels under we want you to do this i
want you to end up right there basically
holding all of your weight in your in
your quads 10 has to happen
just stop
clocks
good chests quads
chest up
the weights idea didn't work
the wood is too slippery so we used a
mat instead same level elevation so when
you see it
don't be like what happened to the
weights you're still there in spirits
chest up hey chess
right here quads come on
go go go go go go go
more huh
yeah let's do it
good chest up good chest
pressure forward
up
one last one one last one one last one
we came here to work
control chest off
you're in charge
up

good stop all right very good take a
break you got one more uh two more sets
okay so 95 95
so
it's cool you're pausing
but you're pausing the most rested
position possible
so i'm going to take the weight down
we're going to do slightly less of a
pause okay

mistake
oops
so no pauses these squads as soon as you
get down come up and unless we say take
a moment to stand and breathe
as soon as you get up this is going to
be real tough right back down not in a
rush just like
as soon as you come up
back down not like
but
and back down okay
rack the barbell and then you're gonna
step
right there
and you're gonna put your hands like
