hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
preventing muscle loss on a cut video
number three
cardio strategies we talked about
training we talked about diet to make
sure you lose as little muscle hopefully
none as possible on a fat loss phase
let's dig in to cardio a couple of
really good points to help you guys out
here
first non-exercise activity
thermogenesis
neat is king and like what the fuck does
that mean
well some of you already know for the
folks that don't
totally fine it's a weird acronym neat
is just general daily movements of your
body
which actually add up to a crapload of
daily calories so for example
do you how many times do you get up and
walk around the house when you're trying
to watch tv
if you have a phone call if you're a
friend or work phone call do you tend to
walk around and paste during the call or
do you sit there
how often do you go check the mail go to
the mailbox or something like that if
you go to the grocery store do you save
as much time as possible and you know
just track your distance and be like
okay i'm just going to go
to the dairy isle get my milk and then
zombie my dieted ass over
and lean on my cart the whole time or do
you like peruse the aisles walk around a
bunch talk to your friends
those are huge differences need is king
so
the more you're active and busy the more
calories you burn
and the stimulus to fatigue ratio of the
cardio that is how many calories you
burn
relative to how much fatigue that
calorie burning costs you is
the best with just moving around in
everyday life
and huge bonus point you get a ton of
shit done
like you're on a fat loss phase and
people are like oh you must be really
behind on stuff nope because i'm up and
around doing stuff
it burns fat which is sweet it costs me
very little fatigue which is sweet
and it makes sure i get stuff done which
also reduces a ton of stress
because if your diet is so hard you
can't get your shit done man that's a
huge
extra stressor and we want as few
stressors as possible on a diet
good example here someone for you guys
to follow on instagram marvin physique
on instagram uh marvin the martian we
also call him he
is a resident of hong kong and
jared feather coached him for a number
of his victories
he's a natural bodybuilder and one of
the leanest people ever
you go check his pictures especially his
contest pictures he has like
glutes on his glutes his face is
striated just the weirdest shit you ever
see in your life
he at weight of something like 150
pounds
never dropped much below 350 grams of
carbs per day
on his diet to a contest you think oh my
god
that's a lot of carbs like that's what i
was eating and i weighed like
25 or 2 30 on my diet how the fuck is
that possible
he at the time was a personal trainer
and he lived quite a bit far from the
personal training gym where he was
working
he would walk to work be on his feet all
day personal training and then walk home
he averaged 20 to 20 000 sorry 20 to 25
000 steps per day which is like they
consider 10 000 and above
high degree of effort 25 000 steps per
day he never did a single
drop of formal cardio he lifted as hard
as he could he got plenty
of food he lost very little muscle
because he was so active and
it was all part of his job so it was a
really really good thing
does that mean you have to do that many
steps no but just try to do as many as
you can
within reason of course not something
that makes you super tired
but the more of your cardio can be that
general physical activity and moving
around and being active
the better number two when you have to
do formal cardio
which is to say get on a machine and do
cardio and come off
choose the ones the modalities that have
the highest stimulus to fatigue ratio
which is to say
that they burn the most calories per
unit time at the smallest expense of
fatigue
the problem is most of the time there's
a general trend
where the more calories you burn per
unit time like jogging
or high intensity interval training the
more high your fatigue is
true but there are outliers there so for
example
walking doesn't burn a ton of calories
per hour but the fatigue is so low
like treadmill walking um that
the stimulus to fatigue ratio the
calories burned to fatigue ratio
is still really really good which is why
neat is still king it has the best sfr
next up is like uphill blocking on a
treadmill still really low impact
still really low fatigue higher for sure
but it burns more calories so it kind of
balances out
next up is something like swimming or
using the elliptical
definitely worse stimulus to fatigue
ratio but because they
are non-impact and they spread the load
over your entire body versus just your
legs
you can get a ton of calorie burn
without a ton of
muscle loss impetus and a ton of fatigue
so they're still preferred to the
second to preferred thing which is
cycling or high intensity interval
training
those do burn lots of calories but they
come with a pretty big fatigue component
cycling as a local component
high intensity interval training
especially if it's interval sprints on a
treadmill
massive impact component not ideal
lastly jogging like if you just want to
lose weight and you don't care about
muscle mass
jogging is phenomenal because it burns
so many calories per unit time
however it absolutely will cost you
muscle mass how many joggers do you know
that are jacked
not exactly the most scientific form of
evidence but not nothing either
so if you want to spare muscle loss you
got to be more on the walking and the
treadmill stuff maybe elliptical and
swimming
less on the side of cycling hit and
jogging notice how almost all
professional bodybuilders
natural or enhanced prepare for
competition they're mostly on the other
end
walking treadmill stuff and they're very
rarely doing things like jogging
point number three keep your cardio
sessions on the shorter end
which is to say anything over an hour
might increase your chances of muscle
loss during that time
a little bit more than you might like
and
as far as if you're just counting
calories in one session by the way
that's per session so if you want to
split that up into two sessions per day
you know multiple hours apart that's
totally fine but at any one session
man an hour at a time is probably good
enough if you're counting calories and
not time
anything two times more than your body
weight in pounds in calories
is probably a good cap so if you weigh
200 pounds
probably don't want to do much more than
400 calories of cardio like if you're
measuring at an elliptical
at a time it's better spreading those so
if you
really some kind of crazy approach have
800 calories to do per day or something
like that
take a one hour session in the morning
one hour session in the evening better
than just doing 800 all at once because
yeah that's gonna get into some pretty
serious muscle loss risk
number four only add cardio when you
need it
and however much you need of it a really
good plan to get pretty lean
or drop lots of body fat often begins
with just starting with neat just your
regular activities maybe get a step
tracker have a minimum number of steps
and just do your thing when for one to
two weeks on end your weight loss goal
isn't met here's your goal and here's
where your graph is
if you're behind on weight loss you need
to create a bigger deficit
which is duh basic science totally fine
what you want to do is ask yourself the
question
which of these choices will cause more
fatigue for me
reducing my calories in my diet or
increasing my cardio
a lot of times if you're starting with
pretty much no cardio at all
then just doing a little bit of cardio
is no problem right but
if later in the diet you're already at a
point where you're doing a ton of cardio
but eating plenty of food if you're
presented with a choice of which one do
i do increase cardio or decrease food
you're like well
i'm eating plenty of food i don't even
feel hungry but i'm doing so much cardio
i feel like i'm running my legs off my
body at this point
don't add cardio or add less of it take
away food
every time you run into problems with
your diet or not
problems with support for phrasing
anytime you run into a
necessity to create a bigger energy
deficit
look at which one of your parameters
food
and cardio can be most toggled with the
least fatigue so like
you know if you're doing barely any
cardio at all
but you're already cutting your calories
to where you're fucking starving
do more cardio don't decrease your
calories more
and it can always be a combination of
the two you can do 200 more calories of
cardio per day
but only decrease your intake by 200
calories
or you can decrease your intake by 400
or you can add 400 cardio and not do
anything for calories it's always a
trade-off always a balance
do whatever it is adds the least fatigue
sometimes you can try it and be like oh
no this isn't the right answer and
recalibrate that's totally fine
and you can repeat that every time a
stall occurs point number five
ideally you want to keep cardio the fuck
away from your lifting as much as
possible
cardio before lifting makes you tired it
makes your lifting worse cardio after
lifting
directly interferes with anabolic
signaling from your lifting and
indirectly
by taking up nutrition that should have
been presented post-workout to your
lifting
now it's not always a possibility to
split your cardio lifting as far apart
ideally four to six hours or more
out that's not always a possibility
sometimes you have to squash them
together so which one do you do first
if the cardio is pretty easy like it's
just incline walking for 30 minutes
and you have to do them together get
your cardio done first lift
and then after lifting consume
post-workout shake meal etc stuff to get
you recovered
because the easier cardio before the
lifting doesn't cost you much as far as
effort might actually be a pretty decent
warm-up
if the cardio is hard or there's a
shitload of it like you're swimming
for 800 or swimming for like four or 500
calories
before you're lifting definitely do the
lifting first have a great hard lift
get your swimming and then as soon as
you get out of the water present
nutrition in order to minimize the
catabolic effects again ideally you
would split them up but if you can't use
this little rubric
next up cardio timing when you do your
cardio
you want it done as far as possible
after your last meal
and as close as possible to your next
meal notice that the
rubric that fits in well with that is
doing fasted cardio
early in the morning not a ton of magic
there it's not like you burn a shitload
more fat
it's that you wake up you do cardio and
that entire time
you're not really hungry because people
don't get hungry when they're doing
cardio they do they get hungry
when they're sitting around and doing
other stuff or after cardio so you do
your cardio in the morning and then you
eat right after
it's a really good idea to eat right
after cardio to minimize muscle loss
risk because cardio puts you into a
catabolic environment fat catabolic
which is really great
but also to some extent muscle catabolic
you want to end that muscle catabolism
by presenting food pretty much as soon
as you're done with cardio
another example that illustrates this
even more is
if you have breakfast at eight in the
morning and you would normally eat again
right around 1 pm then
when do you do your cardio let's say you
have to do your cardio in in this
mid-morning area
when do you do it well if you do it
right at night like 8 30 right after
your first meal
you're essentially burning a lot of the
food that you just ate
and yeah in the end it's all calories
and calories out
but after you do your cardio you're a
little bit more of a catabolic state and
you have to
spend hours and hours not eating yet and
here's the thing
cardio is an anti-hunger mechanism by
itself acutely
which is to say when you're doing cardio
especially if it's a little bit tougher
you're not really as hungry as if you're
just sitting around
after a meal you have a window on a very
hard cut
of two to three hours where you're not
nearly as hungry as you were or not
hungry at all
when that window ceases do cardio right
after
to buy yourself an another hour let's
say of not hunger time
and then you eat right after so that
that entire six hour window of meal
no longer after meal cardio meal that
entire window
well actually even more than that
because then it's after that meal is a
non-hunger state
on the other hand if you do a meal
you do cardio after you can actually if
it's pretty hardcard or you feel kind of
sick
and then two hours later you're hungry
as shit but you don't eat for another
two hours
two hours spent in a high hunger state
is just a shitload of psychological diet
fatigue
you might not want so give that some
thought ideally
eat a meal wait plenty of time until you
get a little bit hungry again it's close
to your next meal
then do your cardio and then eat right
after probably
the best idea there lastly
and this is a real big thing in order to
spare muscle
on a fat loss diet it's absolutely
preeminent in importance
to have your lifting go as well as
possible
as much volume as you need lots of
relative effort pushing it hard
doing everything right so on and so
forth if you do anything that
really messes up your lifting because
lifting is your central wellspring
of muscle conservation you're gonna be
shitting on the golden goose
so any cardio that hurts your lifting a
ton
you should reconsider okay so like if
the elliptical bothers your knees or
your elbows
stop fucking doing it replace it if you
do the stair climber or the stairmaster
and it's really bothering your hips or
something like that and it's hurting you
in the squat
there are 10 other cardio machines you
can also just
walk with headphones listening to
podcasts and still burn the calories
it'll just take you a little while
longer
do that shit don't get into a situation
where like yeah
training legs is tough because i'm
really hurt from all that cardio
bad move if anything do less cardio if
you can't switch to a machine that works
better
or a modality that works better do less
cardio maybe cut your food a little bit
more
yeah that stinks but your lifting is
still high powered and it's important to
make sure your lifting is
goes as well as possible because that
really is the most powerful thing
about the muscle sparing effect folks
hopefully you didn't lose any muscle
during this lecture series got more
great stuff for you coming up on this
channel
stay tuned peace
