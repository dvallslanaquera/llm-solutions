holy shit we are back dr james dr mike
here answering your questions dr mike
how's it going
i'm well i am currently
doing a test peek
to see how the whole bodybuilding prep
week thing goes um it's my last deal of
week before my uh last mezzo of uh prep
and i'm eating beef and potatoes i have
like rice and chicken and beef and
potatoes meals that i'm alternating
and i have to have five of those meals
each of them have like 60 some odd grams
of protein
about 10 grams of fat on average and 200
grams of carbs
which gets interesting to eat potatoes
are tough to eat that much carb like i
you have like one medium sized potato
and you're kind of like woof that was
enough
interesting for me i love the taste and
texture of especially fried potatoes so
i can kind of eat them forever
rice gets me bro i eat some rice and i'm
like
uh
how do people do this uh my first meal
of the day i'm not hungry in the morning
i woke up in the morning to eat my first
and i got through like seventy percent
of it and i was just staring at i was
like what the fuck am i gonna do this
today
okay so like i have always
no surprise to dr mike here but for the
rest of you i am one of the worst cooks
ever and so when dr mike and i were
coming up learning a lot on nutrition
and training and stuff i would just make
the worst meals and my by far one of my
least impressive meals was rice i i
can't cook rice for shit it just burnt
crispy or undercooked like it's always
fucked and brown rice was the worst i
used to always try to make brown rice
and always be horrible so i'm very late
to the party but i got an insta pot
and lo and behold it makes like the most
glorious rice ever and now i have rice a
lot and it's wonderful and it's it's
actually like edible versus just like
concrete
dude that's really good i am
i went double time on the rice
i secured myself
an asian wife and she got an insta pot
or actually a korean rice cooker
so
i don't i outsource my rice making
entirely and it's glorious it's good
having it's it's so different like if
you try to boil rice like you can you
can do it and i've seen people do it
well but man you put it in an instant
pot or a rice cooker game changer
entirely folks get one they're at costco
they're only like like 100 bucks or
something so also related just uh
you know i'm
i'm
the way to prep so i'm uh just pissed
all the time
um i had a random thought
after seeing a comment
that made me really angry and it's um
anytime you um
any time a lot of times on social media
myself or anyone talks about potatoes
somebody has to find it in themselves
the dark part of their heart
the quote samwise from lord of the rings
i i had a feeling this is where this is
going boiler mashem put him in a stew
and like if my version of lord of the
rings was real as soon as he said stew
like a sword would go up through his jaw
and out of his fucking brain and just
pull out and just drop dead shut up
samwise
you only familiarity with potatoes is
because
you're wildly out of shape you're
pointless all you do is bitch you had a
couple clutch moments out of like
it's like a it's like a losing record of
50 and two you know
these two moments where he like sort of
did something good
get out of here this is what dr mike
thinks about when he's when he's
brooding on his cut and his his prep
stuff he's just like the fuck fucking
sam
hey do you want to see a funny comment i
don't take these kind of things to heart
but i thought it was funny nonetheless
where is this
it's on this current uh this this
current one it's at the bottom here
autumn comments
i don't like dr james
amazing
fake profile event horizon
get the fuck out of here i like that
kathy cathy obelo says pity party
because someone complained about your
trans joke why would anybody be
interested in this
i'll never get this 20 minutes back
man kathy we're supposed to be nice on
this channel you're making it profoundly
difficult i'll just say this kathy the
potential number of incredibly witty
insult retorts to that comment that
james and i have is nearly infinite so
you're welcome for us restraining
and uh you know i'm just kidding kathy
yeah i didn't want to hear myself rant
about that either people were asking
about it
yeah there's there's no shortage of in
cellulitis on youtube
the intel game is strong on the tube one
of my favorite things is um people who
say things
to which i would like to just respond
and like in real life person to person
and be like okay if this was told to you
in the context in which you said it
if it was told to you
what sort of response would you be
interested in rendering and what sort of
response are you looking for and then
you realize
they're not looking for a response
they're um expressing themselves
is like a pure form of expression like i
say things that come to my mind to like
your stream of consciousness
did you
did you phrase that as a way to be
constructive did you phrase it in a way
that is logical at all no like i got you
okay so like once you realize a lot of
people just go on youtube um and say
things because maybe i have a lot of
other people to talk to um
they're like oh that doesn't it can't
possibly offend me because this person
is probably
i don't know quite sad in real life and
maybe doesn't have all our friends you
know which is both of us too but that
person is nothing like our loyal
psychotic
incredible super powered youtube
audience
and for them for you folks
we can now cordially begin
okay so first up actually is roughly an
order this time
the kids sky
the good sky you think that's a rapper
the kid
parentheses sky
the sky thing is kind of like you know
yeah it's extra but
great question
he asks hey docs i've heard dr mike
mentioned a couple of times that the
pump itself can cause hypertrophy this
was true doesn't it also imply that
supplements that enhance the degrees of
pumps like al citrulline um
agamatine what the fuck and dietary
i was gonna ask you like i've never
heard of that maybe it was like did you
mean arginine and maybe you just
misspelled it maybe or or that's a real
thing um can also lead to more muscle
growth and long term let me know what
you guys think and also congrats on 250k
subs been supporting since you guys
since 50k awesome thanks the kids guy
well um my interpretation of this is
first of all uh we're not sure we're not
sure it could be so so the evidence for
cell swelling as a mediating mechanism
hypertrophy uh isn't something that we
could consider rock solid it's a little
speculative not a ton of research on it
the research on it is pretty good
we also don't know if cell swelling uh
causes transient hypertrophy or if it
causes long-term remodeling we're not
sure what the differences are between
the various cell types because pump
induced hypertrophy actually occurs in a
bunch of different cells muscle just
being one of them so there's a lot there
that's unknown
um
but the reason the when we're being our
best and couching every statement
probabilistically and in context with
neurons what we say is you know the pump
seems to be related to hypertrophy and
it could actually be causative as well
as quarterly so it's almost definitely
coordinates like the the workouts that
provide the most tension and taking the
closest to failure and are high volume
they're going to give you crazy pumps
almost every time um so it also you know
if you're hypercaloric and you have tons
of energy and you're eating lots of
carbs those are all hypertrophic things
and those result in big pumps if you
take anabolic steroids um
they cause enormous pumps as you can't
even relate to uh you say growth hormone
insulin they're high anabolic they cause
psychotic psychotic pumps but i'm not
really aware of anything you can take
that's anabolic other than like eating
enough protein that doesn't make your
pumps better than if you don't do it
uh you know if you
sleep extra and you're really energized
you get better pumps than if you didn't
you know what i mean like the list goes
on and on so there's lots of correlation
there is there an independent causation
mechanism of the pump it's been
demonstrated at the cellular level but
not in a degree of generality and a
degree of depth and repeatability that
we can say like yes for sure in muscle
cells independently causing a pump
through any mechanism can actually
downstream trigger hypertrophy
now there might be a
that might be the case we're just not
sure about it if that's the case we
could expect expect that doesn't mean it
happens for sure pump uh supplements to
have a marginal effect on the amount of
hypertrophy gain
and
then if that's the case that we have to
imagine that the effect is very small
because as you guys might have noticed
pump supplements surely do all that much
they give you like a time marginally
better pump uh full candid disclosure uh
if you make a mistake of taking uh
substance let's say you live in the
united kingdom and uh you know drugs are
illegal there whatever anabolics if you
take something like oxandralone anavar
and you're generally a responder to that
drug after about two weeks of taking a
decent dosage
if you're you shouldn't take it massive
just take cutting usually but if you're
eating a decent amount of food you'll
have pumps that are confusing you're
like am i gonna die
i feel like my skin is actually tearing
i should stop you'll do curls and then
your forearms will be so pumped plus
your biceps that you actually can't do
any more form work after without taking
a five minute break and just like
shaking your hands out like that's not
some citrulline malate type shit you
feel me like that's a whole different
level and
the pump effect of something like anavar
is probably just a small fraction of its
total hypertrophic yield so we're
dividing you know and and if you take
bar for three months or something you
might put on like two or three pounds of
muscle so as you guys can tell the pump
effect you get out of something like
uh sort of over-the-counter supplements
may be so small that is potentially just
not detectable with study effect sizes
or uh study powers that are realistic in
any sense you may need like 200 subjects
in one group and 200 and another to even
detect this and the study might have to
be carried out for 16 weeks uh those of
you who have seen research studies
carried out or read about them you know
that that study and training basically
doesn't exist nothing even on that order
of scale exists so there could be a a
pump mechanism which through those
supplements causes hypertrophy but the
problem is we don't know if that's true
because we don't know if there's a pure
causation or just a correlation there
and secondarily even if it was
theoretical like oh yeah these things
should cause hypertrophy
uh it would be very difficult to detect
and that's another way of saying that
the long-term growth would also be very
small now if you know nominally that
something works under the hood
you you still put it in like if you have
an oil that you put in your car or some
kind of like vtec extra super ultra oil
you can't tell day to day that it's
doing anything to your car but it adds
like 20 000 miles on the back end you
still do it because you know it's a good
idea right and it's research supported
so maybe if we find very convincing
evidence maybe at the molecular level
mechanistic level
that pump supplements
pumps are probably only important when
you're enhanced like uh arrow gets in
there from uh from the make belief land
and just some says something made up on
the spot uh can you imagine like
somebody who's not enhanced be like i've
never gotten a pump in my life like
you're good you're probably growing a
lot no big deal
you're fine like when i eat a lot of
carbs and try to gain weight to get
great pumps like that pump doesn't mean
anything to stop doing all those things
but uh no but but on a serious note uh
if we find out that there is a causative
mechanism that's dependable they're not
strong we could take the pump
supplements at least in a periodized
basis and sort of know like under the
hood they're kind of working so
potentially there's something there but
honestly we just we just really don't um
uh at least james and i really don't
know if that's really the case james
yeah very good answer there with dr mike
so just to kind of give a lay summary of
what mike said um sometimes we're not
entirely sure like if the pump is
actually grow causing muscle growth or
is it just an indicator that you are
doing everything right that causes
muscle growth and the pump is just a
byproduct of that i tend to be on the
side thinking that pumps probably cause
some degree of growth i'm not sure to
what extent that's kind of the camp that
i'm in at least for now we do know that
it's associative but just to play
devil's advocate right you could just
because it's associative doesn't mean
that it's actually causing the effect
right so you could be could be getting
massive pumps just as a result of blood
flow redistribution hyperemia fluid
shifts to the working muscle and it
could just be a pleasant byproduct of
doing the right things in terms of
training right so that's definitely
feasible i tend to be more on the side
of yeah it's definitely associative
probably has some causal mechanisms as
well in terms of the supplements so
they've looked at
pre-workout stuff like no boosters and
stuff like that for a long time
and what we found is that in that
pre-workout world when you look at some
of those individual components that are
meant to increase pumps and blood flow
they really don't seem to have any kind
of performance enhancing effects when
they're not paired with stimulants
stimulants is really where most of the
pre-workout effect comes from
um if not entirely a very charitable way
to stay yeah the vast majority perhaps
all in many supplements so it's one of
these things where like are there things
that could potentially enhance the pumps
maybe but they don't seem to have like a
tangible effect at least in like a
12-week laboratory type study which is
kind of what goes back to what dr mike
said it might be something that long
term does have an effect
it's just hard to tell at this point i
would argue that the training
adaptations that you make just from
doing resistance training as a result of
being more efficient at blood flow
redistribution creating more efficient
neuromuscular pathways on the movements
that you're training probably has like a
what like a million times greater effect
than any over-the-counter like
supplement that you could take so in my
opinion it's probably not something
worth pursuing though if if you're like
a regular pre-workout user that always
has a ton of citrulline a ton of
arginine and a ton of all that shit
maybe you are reaping
uh i want to see the james hoffman
supplement line it's just a tagline and
it's got all the shit in it
i mean there's so much crapola in there
but yeah those are usually like the big
ones it's like the arginine the creatine
the citrulline malate or whatever uh
caffeine those are kind of the standard
operating pre-workout stuff um so maybe
but probably not
or at least not enough to to get excited
not enough to be sure enough about to
really start buying this stuff and
spending hundreds of dollars a year you
know exactly
all right henrik anderson
says
just click show less so we don't have to
read this whole thing i'm just kidding
i was like seriously yeah we just cut
you off we should have a rule like if we
have to hit the show more button we're
not reading the rest of your question
um
all right henrik says meadow said
something interesting in the previous
roundtable on the raw stronger podcast
i'm paraphrasing
um it's all about volume over time just
like calories in versus out first of all
do you agree second if this is true
wouldn't these statements also be true
the goal is maximum hypertrophy of the
entire body it's more beneficial to
train everything at moderate volumes
instead of let's say half your body
to mrv and switching every so often this
is because the total volume is greater
over time when training everything at
moderate volumes
it's absolutely not clear to me if
that's the case yeah i don't think
that's true at all actually
uh it would be the same volume you just
do some of the body than some of the
body and some dividers
i also run into like systemic fatigue
problems like you just can't do that yes
yes yes and this says he actually
recognized that so this might not apply
to advanced trainees the med threshold
is so high and even some intermediates
and then he says keeping a movement in
for as long as possible until it takes a
toll on your joints is better than
switching it up as soon as the
disruption pump and soreness has
diminished let's do the first one i
think oh yeah yeah yeah okay got it okay
so so so it's all about volume over time
just like calories and calories on so
what i would say is during a specific
phase of training um perhaps um as a
cycle
volume over time is the most important
variable so long as tension and good
technique and all that stuff being a
baseline but so long as tension is
sufficient uh volume over time is good
so for example um if you have a
mesocycle where the lifters start at
five cents per uh muscle per session and
they go to 15 and then they stop
uh and you compare that to your mouth
cycle where they start at 10 and end at
10.
um my prediction and probably james's is
even though we think that the 5 to 15
probably would work better it will work
only marginally better not a ton and
that is the average volume if you do the
same amount of work over the course of
six to eight weeks uh you probably like
roughly equalize roughly um similar very
similar outcomes right so volume over
time is more important than like how you
manipulate the volume now uh that
doesn't work
across mesos and across macros i'll tell
you exactly why calories in calories out
if you do three mesocycles of deficit
and then you do three methyl cycles of
surplus and then you do three measure
cycles of deficit again and then surplus
again for three mesos okay so we have a
total of 12 meso
then you will accrete lots of muscle and
you will probably gain zero fat over the
course of that time period
because and you will maybe let's say
even you weigh the same you'll probably
get a really good recomposition effect
okay you still weigh 70 kilos but now
you have so you know three more pounds
of
lean tissue or three pounds of muscle
and three pounds less fat because it's
the hypocaloric that's the driver and
then the hypercaloric so hyper caloric
drives uh anabolism and hypertrophy
hypocaloric drives fat loss and in that
sequence they're really good now if you
say it's calories and calories out over
time well let's take those 12 mesocycles
and make all of them eu caloric what i
mean by that is it's all about
maintenance calories is your average
calories for that 12 muscle cycle
period are actually identical whether
you mass cut mass cut mass cut or you
maintain average is the same
if that's really the case you will gain
a much smaller fraction of muscle and
lose a much smaller fraction of fat
because you're taking away the entire
hyper and hypocaloric drivers
just the same
ramping of volume from your abilities at
one point
to your abilities at another point is
probably marginally better than keeping
volume the same and fucking over your
abilities
because
you may be missing something on the back
end of each one of those things
for example if you say i'm going to do
10 sets every fucking workout okay
and uh no big deal the first few
workouts or at least first week or two
you are going to be doing something that
has been demonstrated in studies is to
likely cause less hypertrophy because
you will be getting excessive damage
try 10 sets of quads when you haven't
trained quads in a while and you will
just you won't walk for a week and
nobody who's intelligent and exercise
science thinks that's a good idea on the
other hand if you're well adapted to 10
and it's your last week or last two
weeks of accumulation and you're going
strong uh maybe you're like man you know
i can easily recover from like 12 maybe
even 14 for those next two weeks who
cares right like i d load after it
doesn't matter um you're like nah nah
nah we don't want to go overboard like
why not it doesn't matter i deal it
after like nah we're just sticking a
tenth so that is that right there what i
just described is the crux of where
james and i
seem to get into a bit of a rift with
many of the other um evidence-based
folks
almost all of whom we're on good terms
with and many of whom like men are very
good friends um
now in that podcast meadow did say that
he would actually probably lower the
first week or two and raise the last
week or two
so now we're just arguing over details
but i think there is absolutely a good
basis for starting easier to your
abilities to recover and then playing to
your strengths when you've built up a
ton of work capacity and
your body can recover from more and we
know if that's the case more is better
in most terms then you do more when you
can so that results in volume ramping
probably means marginally superior to
what you do over time uh here's another
one we can actually make the same
analogy with eating when you first start
a massing phase
let's say you are supposed to eat an
average or four 000 calories over the
next 10 weeks per day
you can start at 3 500 because that's
really filling at the time and you just
got off of cutting your metabolism isn't
super ramped up yet and then eventually
you can work up to 4 500 because you
both can because you're used to eating
the food and you need to because other
than
37 50 or 4 000 doesn't move the needle
anymore you need to go overboard but if
you just say every day i'm hitting 4 000
i don't care what happens at the
beginning you're going to be fucking
miserable and at the end you'll be like
yeah i could easily eat more you can't
gain more weight but i've seen it like
just
done this and maintained for the last
three or four weeks you got three or
four weeks of maintenance the fuck are
you doing so that the idea that you
should start easy and on the harder note
is more or less universal in training
diet on almost every thing you can think
about and the fact that uh you know i
don't think manner disagrees with us
there are folks out there that do
disagree with it
i don't know i'm not going to speak for
james i personally think let's just um
i'm going to put this charitably and
politely as well do this it's just is
dogmatism that's what it is and it's
like well why would you change this
here's a good reason well i think you
just you're changing too much but it's
not really that's not really much of a
critique uh so to me it's kind of like
well if it makes sense to start easier
and it makes sense to go harder at the
end
we'll just do things that make sense and
it
means you start with less and with more
and if there are compelling reasons not
to do that would love to hear them and
of course the
volume over time is more important than
those things but just because it's more
important doesn't mean it's not a thing
you'll get the same argument from people
that are like uh you know meal frequency
doesn't matter uh all that matters is
calories and protein it's like the other
stuff does matter just less you know it
doesn't mean you just throw it away so
that's my opinion james what do you
think
yeah i don't want to get off on too much
of a tangent here but this is something
that i have been thinking about because
i've been working on the sports
periodization book and this idea i've
been trying to apply the volume
landmarks developing things like sports
skills and tactics and i kind of had
this epiphany and i actually haven't
really pitched this to dr mike yet so
i'm kind of winging it on the fly here i
think we'll largely agree but what we
find especially for hypertrophy training
but this is true of a lot of other goals
i did a really shitty job i just drew it
on the fly here so i know it's probably
going to be in reverse because i'm
putting it on the screen but we'll see
how it turned out here right so what we
have essentially
right when we look at our volume
landmarks kind of curves across each
mesocycle over a block essentially we
see a lot of overlap between them but if
we assume that we start our first one
whether it's a cut or a mass relatively
novel compared to what we have been
doing we see a normal curve and then
each subsequent mesocycle we start
seeing acute adaptations to the same
things that we've been doing and we
start to see this curves overlapping and
getting a little bit higher in terms of
stimulus now in this case we're talking
about volume for hypertrophy this might
also apply to things like intensity of
training for other things as well same
idea but essentially what we see is like
very often to get to our peak
kind of mav type situations maybe it
might take three mesocycles to actually
get there in building up efficiency of
the movements that you're training work
capacity and just some of the cellular
adaptations that you make over time so
really what this kind of implies is that
like it's when we say things like the
volume landmarks are fluid what we mean
is like you're going to see some changes
like meso ones here you know then you
kind of go up a little bit over time
assuming that your training is
relatively stable and then what we see
this argument of like it's all about
volume over time it's like yeah that's a
very oversimplification of it but it is
true in the sense that like you are
starting to build this bigger and bigger
and bigger progressive stimulus over
time as a result of stacking
accumulations in the short term so if
you were just to say it's all about
volume um over time it is kind of
misleading because that's you are
assuming that you're doing everything
else right so if we wanted to be like
really specific this is where i don't
want to go too far down a rabbit hole
here
we use the volume landmarks as a way of
kind of describing this
these ideas but really what we could
also talk about are intensity landmarks
frequency landmarks because you can't
differentiate volume intensity and
frequency if you do one you have the
other at some point so you could break
those things down more explicitly the
point of using the volume landmarks is
to say look
within some reasonable frequency and
some reasonable intensity ranges that uh
are meant to elicit certain goals
whether it's hypertrophy strength power
whatever
we say that volume is kind of the more
practical
uh variable in terms of dosage right we
say like if you're building a program
volume is the one that is the thing that
you can impact the most and have the
most effect on your training assuming
that frequency and training are in these
relative ranges right so um it's kind of
a very complicated issue and uh i think
that yes volume over time is definitely
kind of the underlying idea just like dr
mike said if you're just talking about
calories and protein it's like yeah
you're most of the weight there but that
other stuff is important too and it's
important to remember that your mevs
mavs and your mrvs are actually going to
be shifting over time and that's when we
see that kind of like overlapping effect
of those volume landmarks curves over
time so if you just looked at that um
without a critical eye you'd say oh yeah
volume just goes up over time but it's
like the volume is creeping up as a
result of these very short-term
adaptations that you are making and in
order to keep the stimulus robust you
have to keep training harder and harder
and harder so your actual true mav for a
block or even a macro cycle might
require three mesos to even get there
that's what i think is really
interesting and that's something in
sport training is very apparent like you
cannot develop
certain skills until you get very good
at some basic things right and that's
kind of the same idea here with
hypertrophy training is you might not be
able to create the most robust stimulus
until you build up to it a little bit
yep
oh dr stone yep yep yep no no no
no no no no all right
asayus
cassius that's not how you normally
support cassius i don't know
uh
uh he asks hey docs i love the response
the question about drinking and i was
wondering about the effects of weed on
hypertrophy
goddamn drug addicts on our channel
i use
more than 0.5 grams
during the week at night after working
so i actually don't know what that means
because i only deal in milligrams of thc
as far as reference values uh i don't
know
what the
i'm assuming that means he's smoking a
half more than half a gram yeah is that
a lot
i think that's like a pretty standard
dose right okay
uh after working lifting and eating
first dinner on the weekends i smoke
more are the anti-inflammatory effects
of cannabis having an effect on the
muscle damage stimulus vector muscle
recovery almost certainly not does
marijuana cause any decrease in upper
tree by reducing the amount of deep
sleep maybe but you got to do a lot of
weed to do that
and unless you're
just
literally hitting up edibles and then
going to sleep it's probably not likely
uh basically am i am i leaving long-term
gains on the table due to being a
pothead anecdotally it helps need
necessary calories for bulking that's
cool um
so my take is unless
so if you try
sleeping without weed
and you have notably more restful sleep
and you have super deep dreams
and if you sleep with weed and it's just
not so good sleep then you're probably
missing out
um
all the other research on weed that
testosterone estrogen ratios doesn't
seem to be very conclusive um and uh
bodybuilders
who do weed
are number in the millions or whatever
and there's not like you know most
bodybuilders don't drink or at least
very often because they they know uh
it's just like uh something like
ecologically experientially most people
know it's a stupid idea uh we there's no
such consensus and really most
bodybuilders don't have a strong opinion
on it one way or another so i'm inclined
to because there's not a ton of direct
research i'm inclined to think that the
mechanism is just not that strong and
it's probably not a big deal one way or
another and the thing is if weed helps
you relax
a lot which it does for a lot of people
and really just move just de-stress and
enjoy especially you don't smoke out
right before bed you smoke it in the
evening and then by the time you're
getting to sleep you're a little bit
more sober that can actually have a met
positive on many people because where as
dr james hoffman and my recovery book
points out the relaxation part of
recovery is a big fucking thing if you
can really unwind regularly man you can
just power through all the shit you have
to do
um in the rest of your life so i think
uh you know if you get nothing out of
weed but you do it because you're
fucking addicted to it you just need
help independently so i don't know how
many people are physiologically addicted
to weed i don't even know if that
happens um but if you something fun
that's part of your life
and you do it a few nights a week or
even every night of the week but you
don't go overboard and you're not sleep
quality is not fucked up and you can
stay on your nutrition plan that's
probably uh our my best guess here is
it's probably just fine it could be even
a slight nut positive if it allows you
to really cool it james
you're doing the marijuana cigarettes
yeah so i think there's kind of a
similar time
series effect here like with alcohol so
like if you guys have ever like done the
the very unpleasant situation of like
taking a bunch of shots or having a
bunch of drinks right before you go to
bed you know how that goes um marijuana
has a very similar time series effect so
i think if you want to benefit from the
relaxation effects of either smoking or
doing edibles or any of those things
it's probably better to space it a
little ways away from bedtime here's
kind of the trade-off right a lot of
people do it in the evening to kind of
wind down which is good in the sense of
kind of it is a wind-down routine it
does help you get relaxed but
when it is proximal to sleep like that
it can interfere with those deeper sleep
cycles so i would say if you're gonna do
it in the you know evening times maybe
push it closer to like dinner time and
maybe less towards actual bedtime which
is kind of i know it's kind of defeats
the purpose for some people but i think
that would be better in terms of not
interrupting your sleep and you still
get to benefit from the relaxation
effects
next up actually a
quick to answer question from forest
nash fitness
is hi doc's my questions about post
workout carbohydrate sources i think a
lot of people myself included like to
have fruit for carbs after training
because it's convenient tasty and
healthy however someone like ourselves
are interested in maximum gains i'm
guessing this is leaving cards and carbs
on the table because many fruits have
moderate or slow digestion rate for
example lately i've been eating dates
post-workout they actually have a
phenomenally
fast digestion rate i don't know where
the hell you got that gi of 62 let's
check the internet real quick give me
one sec
uh
yeah i'm sorry i thought dates were
higher than that
it's like dates and raisins i think are
both very
are up there
but maybe we're wrong
oh it's because it does have a lot of
fiber
trippy i've always heard dates are super
high glycemic index um the glycemic load
you can get out of it is massive because
you can get a fuck a lot of carbs for
like three dates um
let's see uh and also a certain fair
amount of fiber
um i know dr mike likes to have kids
cereal post workout and other people
like to have candy and jelly beans etc
i'm wondering what boxes specifically
need to be checked in order to ensure
that posts work out carb sources close
to optimal uh for example glycemic index
types of sugars accompanying fiber fat
and fiber etc yes sorry this question
has already been answered in the rp diet
book it has almost every diet question
has i haven't read it yet but that's
next on my list after a finished
recovery book awesome uh thanks so much
for help our pleasure so for us real
quick glycemic index the uh the closer
to 100 the better
uh types of sugars uh starches and or
dextrose or glucose sugars keep low on
the fructose
and lack of accompanying fat and fiber
check the less of those two things you
have the better and that's optimality
from like you live in a laboratory and
you're running like a fucking hundred
units of insulin and all the farm in the
world and you just need to smash as many
carbs as possible into your day and this
is your post-workout meal uh but in the
real world there are other factors that
uh enter into optimality one of them is
of course health english fruits are
great another one is a hunger
suppression so like after your workout
on a cut if you eat fruits you don't
want to eat for another three or four
hours that's like the ton of boxes
checked versus if you eat like kids
cereal 30 minutes later you're starving
to death in a glycemic shock so uh
fruits are totally fine what i would say
this i would give you a flexible answer
if you're having trouble putting on
weight and if you're having you need to
eat more in the workout window because
you're like i know i'm super absorptive
i'm super hungry and i need to get in
these carbs otherwise there's no way
they're going down any other way uh then
i would say start trending into the
direction of higher glycemic foods more
starches and dextroses and as low of fat
and fiber as you can get them with a
really good product
the tip of the spear of this
is serious mass
by optimum nutrition it has like 50
grams of protein 250 grams of carbs
almost exclusively from maltodextrin
which breaks down into glucose
asap and uh and other glucose polymers
which break down into glucose very
quickly and also has basically almost no
fat and no fiber to speak of and it's
super easy to get down but that's like
if you're smashing it and you don't need
to be doing it all the time that's the
funny thing about optimality is the
optimality constraints that james and i
wrote into the diet book that's for
people who need to smash smash smash
especially multiple daily workouts like
if you have a huge crossfit event
and two hours later you have another
massive event you need to be carved up
you're getting fucking serious mass
there's no no question about it but if
you live in the real world and you have
one workout per day and hunger is a
concern and so is health and so is being
able to eat on the go geez you know your
optimality equation is altogether
different so then fruits may very well
fit in and i've had plenty of fruit post
workout window on fat loss phases uh i
think it's fun great but you know when
you really need to smash it in then you
go to the checklist that we just
described james yeah i'm glad you
brought off those lifestyle trade-offs
because those are really really good
points um and especially to forests if
you're not if you don't feel like your
recovery in between sessions is limiting
uh is limited with the current
carb sources that you're eating then you
might not be incentivized to change it
if you were eating a ton of fruit and
then you had another workout later in
the day or the next day and you still
kind of felt flat and just not like
supercharged then i might make a case
and say yeah maybe just think about
switching up those carb sources because
it doesn't seem like you're just putting
them back in as efficiently as you could
but if you are generally feeling good in
your work are normal good all the above
um the fruit is perfectly fine
especially because it checks a lot of
those other boxes like dr mike said so
you don't necessarily have to do that
unless you think that your um you know
glycogen or synthesis in between
sessions is a limiting factor that's
really kind of the the crux of should
you glycemic index or not post workout
is like well what do you got going on
later today or tomorrow not much don't
worry about it you know or if you're
just doing like normal once a day
training you're going to have plenty of
carbs the rest of the day probably don't
need to worry about it all that much
um
all right
next up
michael fortune
got it
how long should one take off of training
before they get blood work done to my
knowledge having hard training sessions
slash endurance training close to a
blood work test can raise liver
functions ast alt levels and uh blood
urea nitrogen levels yep it sure can and
it can do a whole lot of other stuff
generally speaking if you get your blood
work done regularly a not mentally
unwell doctor can realize that your
baseline levels are higher for these
things and your perfectly good health
and follow-up measurements say you're
fine and then they can understand that
you're
um
you know like doing super well for
yourself so um
uh
what's it called so uh somebody who used
to uh work for rp dr spencer he's really
knows the stuff about how to deal with
like people who lift weights and he'll
be the first to tell you that like if
you are a doctor and you have a weight
lifter and you look at blood you need
nitrogen and it's high and you're like
oh my god you have kidney failure like
other doctors who know things will laugh
at you rightfully because you're just
not doing a good job
right it's like looking at a person
who's recovering from cancer and being
like jesus you're still dying it's like
it's better than last month he's like oh
oh that's right you had cancer oh my bad
i didn't see that in the chart you know
so um that's the first thing is you know
it doesn't really matter if you have a
good doctor the second thing is if you
really want to sort of put the pin in
that then i would say at the end of a
deload week because the real stuff that
causes all these disruptions the most of
it is just uh muscle damage like if you
go into a blood work and your quads are
so sore you hardly can sit down dude
your creatine kinase levels are gonna be
like um you're uh i came in after a
bodybuilding show once um because i had
like crazy crazy psychotic food
poisoning and i was vomiting up literal
blood still did the show came in after
the show and i was like i hadn't drink
water in a while they're like you have
kidney failure and i was like really and
they're like yeah here are your ck
levels and i was like i don't have
kidney failure my pee's not red i i feel
i felt better i felt worse this is
insane i mean straight up told them
right there i was in hospital but i was
like thanks i don't have kidney failure
iv flutes please they did that and then
the next test three hours later was like
oh your kidneys are fine like fucking
shit like i have like 220 pounds of
muscle or what the hell do you think
like i get dehydrated and all of a
sudden my values go crazy so um if
you're sore if you're super fucked up
super fatigued the stuff will be off so
towards the end of your deload week you
should test pretty normal however a high
level of muscle mass still has more
turnover with a bunch of this kind of
stuff and these levels will still be off
so again it comes back to point number
one of get a doctor that knows things
see you don't have to belabor the point
of proving to him that you're not dying
um
right one quick funny story um
i know that happened to a lot of friends
but uh one of my friends in uh
college was a very very good lifter and
uh he was uh pakistani obviously he's
american but his parents came from
pakistan maybe he was born there but you
know no accident and everything and he
has like
his doctor i think he's also pakistani
in old school like also an immigrant and
uh he comes in and and hussain was like
just jacked out of his mind um and the
doctor's like what is all this for and
austin's like
what's all what for he's like the
lifting and the whole muscle thing you
know and uh he's like what's fun and i
like it
and he's like what are you getting into
like as far as your career is like like
data science and actuarial sciences like
you don't need all this you should stop
lifting and he was like hey hey thanks a
lot doc that was really great he just
walked out like
like guy i know i understand you got
your you know your medical education in
islamabad in 1962 which i'm sure a fine
basic education in biology or for the
love of god like it's just culturally
there was no like
so you got to make sure your doctor is
not a person who's completely unfamiliar
with sport or muscular bodies because
then you'll just get a lot of weird
stuff like um
and blear blood work and they won't know
how to make sense of it but if you have
a doctor also make sense of it they can
tell you oh you're totally great here
versus like oh shit you're actually
still dying because it's not just the
muscles you're actually dying because of
this
that's so dumb especially because now we
know that like lean body mass is
correlated with so many good health
outcomes and longevity and yeah
dying from things less
yeah it was
less likely to die from being hit by a
bus right by anything it was one of the
kind one of the points of conversation
husson recalled was the doctor was like
you don't need all this and huss is like
i don't he's like no he's like oh thanks
thanks for letting me know he's like
because they're so confused like 10 year
old i don't need this hand but i like
having it like
i always wanted to be hustling be like
i'm smarter than you
i just want you to know that and i know
a lot more about this than you do do my
blood work shut up and get out of here
yeah and um you know
michael you can always just ask your
doctor too and just say like here's my
situation tell me what tell me what you
want so that way we can always be on the
same page when should i get my blood
work and if he's like oh i don't know
then you might get a new doctor yeah and
if he says it doesn't really matter then
that's fine you can just do whatever
and that's not to say some doctors just
aren't used to dealing with jack muscle
people and that's totally cool because
they're great for everyone else who's
not an insane asshole like us but you
know there's different kinds of doctors
there's doctors who lift and doctors who
know stuff about that and they're great
maybe they're not great uh doctors for
other people that have other special
conditions and lifestyles
all right uh shout out to kimberly
kimberly we're not gonna answer your
question because we're woefully
unqualified to answer it but you said
all the right stuff kimberly asks about
how she should be training during
pregnancy uh i would actually send an
email to renaissance periodization or
actually chat with customer service and
ask about resources or getting put in
touch with a coach to do a consult about
how to train during pregnancy and we
have like uh geez at least five to ten
rds that would be more than happy to get
in a call with you for some uh kind of
fee in order to explain to you down to
the wire of everything that's good and
bad about lifting with pregnancy uh
james and i have the kind of education
about this that the average exercise
science graduate student has about how
to lift weights for hypertrophy which is
to say we know like volume and intensity
and
exercise selection nominally but i i
james unless you feel confident getting
into how to do this i'm sure as hell
don't like i know a few things but
i would say don't do muay thai don't
take body shots
but you know not that's a harsh
statement take a few you want to harden
that baby up you feel me you don't want
that being coming out of the world
oh belly pad i used to love wearing that
one oh yeah practice
people could just wear yeah
yeah i don't know
joking aside i don't uh i don't i don't
really have a ton of input sorry this is
out of my
there was a woman who was like seven
months pregnant she was doing really
high intensity crossfit and it was a the
video uh was viral and there's so many
comments oh my god i can't believe she's
destroying her child and this and that
and some of the funny responses were
like
by what mechanism is this hurting the
child it was just like you just see the
dogma because they're like well it's got
to be and it's like i got you how and
you actually talk to doctors and like
yeah you can actually trade really
really hard all the way up to like month
nine which i know for a fact is true but
there's nuances to that and there's some
things you should be doing something you
shouldn't and the crossfit lady wasn't
doing any stuff you shouldn't be doing
but like definitely don't just quit
training and you're trained pretty hard
but do talk to your doc and maybe
consult some rp folks or somebody else
who knows
yeah shit
i only know one thing about pregnancy
how to not make it happen you feel me
boys
i got pull out condom male contraceptive
i got tubes tied what else we got james
probably missing something uh uh
vasectomy
no no tube's tied same thing
um
get cut off
just let's got to do something full unit
with the balls
because you know you never get you wake
up in a hotel room and there's a girl
like getting a needle you know this is
i'm i'm just going to cut myself off
we'll get banned from the channel saying
shit like this but damn that i should
have gotten rid of my balls all right
damn it uh so go up go up go up it's
meat meat bag meat bag egg aptly named
meat bag let me cross him off the list
to make sure we catch him
all right mr meat bag or oh god i don't
want to gender that person mrs meat bag
says hey guys um i've seen blue ham
raises nordic hamstring curls the
indicator is particularly beneficial
with injury prevention for athletes my
gym lacks a
glute ham
[Music]
i don't know
why it's called ghd
ghr
i mean it's yeah exactly i don't this is
always perplexed to me is it a glute ham
device i don't know what is the d
fuck hold up we gotta look this up i
feel like joe rogan's google guy
ghd ham string curls
ghd
ghd
no
growth hormone device oh the glute ham
developer that's really something
developers
every exercise is developed that
nonsense exclude hammers um so i'll say
oh say any and then he says are they
really doing anything that can't be
accomplished with exercises like slds
and machine learned girls so i'll tell
you what i know and then james will tell
you a lot more
the advantage
for injury prevention with athletes is
specifically for running athletes and uh
you have to have a modality that allows
you to control and slow
high forces and velocities in an
eccentric position that is what that's
how people pull their hamstrings when
they run it is they're actually slowing
their leg down from swinging out and it
goes boink right so the these types of
loaded hip movements can really put a
ton of tension and slow the bottom and
then come back up slow the bottom that
makes it a good movement which is maybe
better done
on a glute ham device
and nordic curl than some other things
uh definitely the machine leg curls
especially if you get a ton tension at
the bottom but there's stuff like a
deadlift and glute and uh good
good morning are well within the range
of exercises that are awesome and that's
where my knowledge ends and james's
begins
yeah very good so um the first question
you kind of have to ask yourself is are
you training to prevent injuries or are
you training to improve performance or
get more jacked right because those are
two kind of diverging paths at some
point so the firs that's kind of the
first thing is like am i training to not
get hurt which you know at this point is
you're doing more physical therapy than
you are training um so the second point
is um
i hate this idea of like do this
exercise to prevent running injuries
here's why the reason why people pull
their fucking hamstrings during running
or sprinting is because they haven't
built up enough work capacity and
running or sprinting to not hurt
themselves yet doesn't mean that you
need to do these stupid ass nordic curls
or anything else it just means you need
to have a progression of a gradual
buildup of tolerance into running and
sprinting so here's a great way to get
your athletes hurt have them take all of
summer or christmas break off and have
them come back and do sprints day one
guaranteed somebody's gonna pull
hamstring why because they haven't been
training that in a long time and you're
asking them to exert a huge amount of
power through the muscle right what you
need to do first and foremost is
obviously strengthening all of the
muscles that you want if you're running
for a running sake or if you're running
for a sport like soccer or rugby or
whatever you're going to train all the
muscles that contribute to success in
the sports hamstrings just happens to be
one of them just like quads or anything
else
and then at that point you're training
those to get stronger right so that's
the differentiation you're not training
to prevent injuries you're training to
make those muscles stronger and more
powerful so that you can be more
successful in your sporting endeavor
whether it's running or sport etc
and then you have to have a systematic
approach to your running or sprinting
regimen which builds you up slowly over
time and that's going to have the most
influence on whether or not you get hurt
um doing your sporting activities
particularly running so with the like
with the rugby guys what i used to work
with in their offseasons we wouldn't
train sprinting at all we would work as
part of their kind of dynamic warm-up we
would do some mechanic drills as just
part of their active warm-up we would
have like a a running progression and
like a ramping up and as we moved from
our general preparatory work we would
start moving into our specific stuff and
we would start taking some sub and i
hate saying this like sub max sprints
where it's like i want you to run with
your sprint mechanics but we're going
like maybe 80 it's kind of hard to do
like a 70 sprint right because it's like
is that a run or is it a jog what is
that but you ask them to do the same
movement just with less power output and
then you kind of have a progression of
volume and intensity like you would do
for any other sport training so long
story short
train to get better don't train to
prevent injuries and then just have like
a sensible approach to your training so
that you're not injuring yourself doing
stupid shit all the time how about that
god damn
god damn it go james go
get those nordic hamstring curls out of
my face
next up is hey you gay h-e-u-g-e
juice
hugo
i don't
know on the effects of pre-workout slash
simulants on method cycle length get the
artificial boost create greater fatigue
over the long term yes
stop using pre-workout and i noticed i
can go longer on motorcycles anything
else
that's a cool uh anecdote right yeah so
i will say something else almost
certainly did change and that was how
much relative effort you were putting on
an average which is probably higher with
brewer cuts which is why your muscle
length is shorter could be coincidence
but would like your thoughts so those
are my thoughts at least i'll tell you
this
there's not a right or wrong answer
with how how
high your relative intensity should be
relative effort should be with a meso if
you start at two to three rar and then
you can only go for four weeks versus if
you start a three or four rir and can on
and it can go for six weeks
james and i actually can't tell you
which one of those is better some
individuals may respond better to one or
the other and roughly on average are
probably about even
um
so what we don't want to see
is you doing two things one if you're
the kind of person that really gets a
lot out of pre-workout stims and really
kind of needs them in the sense that
without them they're just kind of just
like a deflated pillow a deflated
whoopee cushion
then we don't like to see you doing five
or six rar pretending it's three or four
or just going weeks and waffling oh i've
trained for 12 weeks straight some
people like tell james and i don't need
to deload like yeah
whatever you also don't train hard
yeah
so don't do that and if you need
pre-workouts to fix that problem
good
and then also don't do the opposite
where you're just grinding way close to
failure
damn near most of the meso and then just
going so close to failing all the time
that you don't really get into that
golden zone of
three two one rir where most of the
games happen if you're like start at one
and then zero zero zero and you just
grind and fall off
and if that's fueled by psychotic
pre-workout energy then you could be
easy on that shit um a lot of people
don't need pre-workout i have not used
pre-workout in living memory um and i
just don't eat it i get enough sleep and
i i'm fucking mentally unstable as it is
training hard for me it's just like oh
it's fun and i just do it anyway i i i
would rather do more work i have to cut
myself off most of the time like stop
especially with like back i get a great
back bump going the shit's feels great
i'm like i could do fucking 80 sets
today i got to stop at 10 because my
back's going to fall off my body so but
other people that may be different and
then so basically what you want to do is
generally just train from three or four
ir all the way to zero don't make any
crazy jumps don't start too little don't
start too much and if pre-workout gets
you into that zone great if you can take
pre-workout and stay in that zone great
but if pre-workout gets you out of that
zone or if no pre-workout can't let you
get into that zone then you either need
to take pre-workout or stop fucking
taking or take less of it so the real
problem is training too easy or too hard
yeah excellent answer i mean pre-workout
is just an excuse to do drugs like let's
be honest which is fine
i love it
questions more honest it's it's
basically like a legal alternative to
meth right which is great a lot of
people like meth a lot of people like
pre-workout i bet you those people
overlap quite a bit um great reviews
yeah just keep in mind that all
stimulants whether it's pre-workout or
you know taking lots of caffeine coffee
energy drinks etc they're effectively
kind of masking the fatigue that you
have it definitely can give you that
boost and it feels good to have that
boost in the gym but yeah one of the
effects that you can kind of be getting
the false positive like i feel great
it's like wow you feel great right now
but really after this wears off in a
couple hours you're going to feel like
dog shit um and that's normal so some
people talk that's when you get that
weed baby yeah exactly they just take
the uppers and downers all day long baby
um
yeah so it's kind of a personal
preference thing i don't think there's
anything wrong with either as mike said
it's not clear that like adding a week
of
less intense training is necessarily
better than one week less and higher
intensity training it's kind of probably
around the same as long as you're
recovering in between each meso so i
don't really see a huge incentive i do
think it's good to kind of um
periodize your caffeine intake to some
degree like some people just like it as
a kind of like routine like many people
like to just have like the routine of
making the coffee waking up having that
doing their thing that's fine if you're
going really heavy on the pre-workout
there's just a lot of stimulants in
there and it is kind of worth tapering
having some tapering down periods from
time to time i am not one to
to necessarily ramp up like the dosage
like where you say i'm using this
milligrams now and this milligrams and
you know that seems like a little
overkill to me but i do think it is good
to have like an active rest period from
the pre-workout
uh yeah
yeah yeah very well phrased
next up
look at this is right below that one oh
no big tim dog that's pretty oh man ten
dogs
one uh 100
uh eduardo
benitez
oh so spicy
the fuck are you eduardo
well it looks like we're doing control f
[Music]
gotcha
all right so eduardo
asks
hey docs first off i love everything rp
the youtube vids the podcast all the
content you guys put out so now thank
you so much
my question is as follows i work
slash workout at a gym with limited
equipment mostly dumbbells and
resistance bands obviously progressive
overload is a large driver for trophy
but what are some other techniques
tactics i can use to grow with limited
equipment basically just ramping my
volume
to where my workouts are and
over an hour long open to all
suggestions ooh actually fuck james
please begin to answer this question and
i'm gonna do something kind of kind of
neat here uh hit it
so i'm just trying to reread the
question what are some other techniques
and tactics you can use to grow with
limited equipment yeah so you can also
play around with some intensification
techniques here there's some that are
more conducive than others like you can
do things like mile wraps rest pause
type things you can do like super
settings if you have a limited time i'm
the
what i'm curious about in the question
here is that he's kind of mentions that
ramping my workouts uh ramping the
volume up to where my workouts are over
an hour long so if that to me that makes
me sound like there's like a maybe a
potential time constriction so at that
point i would use like a constrained
rest time and you can use things like
antagonist supersets things like that
one thing that helps me i have a home
gym and i don't have a ton of time that
i can dedicate to training every day is
i try to find the best sfr movements
that i can with what i've got and one
thing that i do is actually just set a
hard timer and usually my rest is
incomplete like meaning i could i should
be probably resting a little bit longer
um and then just add more sets so
there's a trade-off to be made there in
that i probably don't have the as
intense of workouts as i could but i
also get a really really gnarly pump and
volume stimulus in a relatively short
amount of time which is kind of if i'm
if i'm reading your question right kind
of what you're getting at um
dumbbells and resistance bands i'm not
sure there is kind of like limits to
what you can do with resistance bands
mike what did you think about the
resistance bands portion do you even
want to tackle that or just stick with
the dumbbells
well
i have actually an article to me
oh fucking found it
so
uh i found an article that i wrote a
while back i knew i wrote this article
back during uh early day covet thing and
it is basically uh so it's titled
hypertrophy from home keeping the gains
coming during lockdown
and it's basically designed to answer
the question of exactly how do i modify
my normal training in order to make it
uh most valuable
when i'm
if very limited equipment so
what i'm going to do now is
let's see if this works
check this article out
colon
paste
dr mike
reply
all right see if you can refresh that
james
oh god get out of here
[Music]
boom
so you want to click on it real quick
james it's just we don't have to belabor
the point but basically like
there's a bunch of stuff you can do
want to choose the right exercise
getting closer yeah yeah bottom right
right there bottom right of the white
stuff
bottom right yeah it's it took me a
while too um
getting closer to failure than usual
which is something you can do in your
home less resting less doing more sets
and what else do we have training more
often because so people be like oh man
squats really beat me up well now you
squat at home with fucking dumbbells you
can squat three or four times a week
you'll be fine um and then progressing
in overload with reps rather than weight
because you can ride on a weight and
then small variations and then of course
time saving stuff
i'll i'll add one thing here
and they choose the right exercises this
is covered but you want to leverage your
muscles in such a way that basically
like um
maximizes the amount of work they have
to do and minimizes their leverage
advantage so instead of squatting like
back and down you want to squat on a
really high heeled surface so you can
squat like a 60 squat style really
forward really really exposing your
quads that stuff helps in the gym anyway
and has good sfrs but the problem with
that training like that all the time is
that the raw stimulus magnitude isn't as
high but that's not a problem when
you're in the gym you can put 400 pounds
on your back when you're at home you
only have 100 pounds you got to leverage
because otherwise you're just you're not
going to be able to like just do like
people are like oh this is this is how
you know you're dealing with somebody to
know the fuck they're doing it'll be
like at home training program with just
10 pound dumbbells first exercise dead
lifts it's like you're dead lifting
10-pound dumbbells in your fucking mind
and like for beginners and stuff that's
totally great but i've seen that
advanced program like jesus christ one
guy sent me his program during covent
music i want to sell this and what do
you think about this program i'm like
i just said some nice things but i was
like you have movements in here that are
not at home movements you have set in
rep schemes and progressions which
require a shitload of weight
it's not an at-home program you just
call the program at home
so eduardo give that article a read and
i think it'll really put you uh into the
right uh into the right direction
one thing that i just thought of as we
were talking about that eduardo is um
one of the hardest ones to deal with is
legs because it's like okay
like mike said sometimes you just don't
have enough weight and this is something
that i usually wouldn't recommend but i
do find to be helpful with limited
equipment at home is a more unilateral
training you can do things like the step
ups the single leg squats the single leg
stiff leg a deadlift with dumbbells that
is maybe not totally optimal but in
terms of getting a really good raw
stimulus magnitude is a a welcome
compromise for that issue
[Music]
all right second to last question asker
for the day is blake james
blake james two first names
can't trust that man
got it
blake says hey docs i always heard
people quote the world health
organization getting 150 minutes of
light cardio a week but they almost
always leave the rest the court out the
who follows that up by saying
uh or get 75 minutes oh or get 75
minutes of moderate to intense cardio or
some combination of the tube i use a
fitbit to track steps and calories
burned with a big grain of salt because
it seems to always be much higher than i
felt like it should it also tracks
cardio time and if your heart rate is
higher than 136
um it counts it as moderate cardio
giving you credit for double time
is this still an acceptable way to
calculate your cardio time for the week
also for me more specifically i hate
cardio dr mike has a video about going
to a dark place in your mind to get a
few extra rubs close to failure i do
much better going to that place every
time i do cardio and being out 15 to 20
minutes five to six times a week an
elliptical than trying to grind out 150
minutes walking on a treadmill uh or
lowering my intensity on the elliptical
uh for general health am i going to see
any less return doing cardio this way no
higher intensity cardio actually is
better for your health so five to six
times for 20 minutes grinding hard on
elliptical is actually better for your
health probably on average especially if
you don't train any other way than just
doing like a lot of slow walking cardio
but if you also lift weights which i
assume you do you're fucking totally
golden with both those i wouldn't worry
about it and then um for general health
am i going to see any less return no
higher return for hypertrophy if you're
grinding on the elliptical it's not
great fibrotrophy and i would say lower
intensity cardio is better but if you're
doing hypertrophy you're doing high
volumes and you're breathing pretty
heavy during perturbate training and
you're doing whole body and you're doing
pretty frequently and you're doing any
kind of lower intensity cardio and
you're keeping your weight in check i
think you're just about as healthy as
you can get and any more cardio on top
of that is is bonus but it's really
unnecessary um and it also says i'm also
going to save this video to show my exes
and children when they come into
drinking age to inform them on smart
drinking yeah nice
uh yeah but that's my take is i think
yeah you don't want to grind a super
hard cardio if you're really interested
in hypertrophy we really interested in
hypertrophy then health-wise
by definition you're not so interested
in health or at least maximally so i
think there's not a huge difference
there and as long as you get the cardio
any way you can i think you're totally
good and um
high volume hypertrophy training is you
know they'll note not included in the
who recommendations but if they included
it they would take down the amount of
formal card you have to do by maybe as
much as half because the good hyper
training is great cardio
yeah i think that those those two
recommendations the 150 minutes or the
75 of moderate is actually i think those
are actually acsm recommendations that
the world health just uses
coincidentally um and so one of the
things to keep in mind is that those
recommendations are kind of assuming
that you're not living a super active
lifestyle the rest of the time so you
could probably shave off quite a bit of
minutes even from low intensity or high
intensity
if you are just living a more active
lifestyle like if you are somebody with
a relatively high step count per day or
like mike said if you lift weights or
you have other hobbies or recreational
activities that are physically you know
somewhat demanding you can shave that
down pretty substantially this is for
people who are more kind of like
sedentary like they maybe have an office
job and don't you know do a ton of stuff
in their free time phys they're just not
physically active people so this is kind
of like what you would do to put those
people into a more healthy state if
you're somebody who likes to go hike or
you like to ride your bike or you play
rec league soccer and you lift weights
like man you can shave that down quite a
bit because you're getting so much other
physical activity and either directly or
indirectly a lot of cardio
another example too is like
you could do a hit training twice per
week and probably reap just as much
benefit if not more and that would
probably be a collective of like 30
minutes maybe 40 minutes on the top end
um you don't need to do a ton it's only
you only need to do this kind of grindy
cardio if you are otherwise inactive
oh
wh
rob zim 1000 is our last fuck for the
day is that rob zombie
it is zim zim but pretty close
is that rob zombie or something stupid
like metallica yeah some dracula
i don't mean metallica stupid please
don't kill me if you wanna if you guys
want to see a great concert live i don't
know
covet and stuff but i've seen rob zombie
play it more than a few times live man
that guy puts on a show that is a
it's a hoot
[Music]
all right robzim says hello docs i would
like to know when it is an optimal time
to perform stretching in relation to
exercise and recovery with hypertrophy
mobility being the focus different
sources say various things and some are
contradicting would it be nice to hear
run down of static versus dynamic as
well as timing before exercise between
sets or after workout personally i've
noticed that in actually gaining
mobility while progressing through
movement i'm assuming this is good but
having conditions with the idea that i
also need to do purposeful stretching in
order to be fit and have longevity jesus
christ can you point me in the right
direction thank you guys i've come to
trust rp as a source of intelligent
reliable information and appreciate both
of you very much i'll thank you so much
also dr mike keep your head up they can
take your ig but they'll never take you
love it
love the braveheart reference there
so
while i'll say my two things then uh
james will pick thing up as usual
uh hypertrophy and mobility there are
two folk foci that can be contradictory
at the extremes however if you do proper
headphone training through full range of
motion you will get a lot of mobility
you probably don't have to stretch at
all
uh if you also want extra mobility uh
it's stretching as any other stimulus is
ideally paired as far away from your
workout as possible so maybe you would
stretch a train in the morning and then
do a nice little relaxing yoga-based
stretching session in the evening and
that probably be the most ideal thing
you could do stretching before training
makes you a little weaker also maybe
expose you to more injury risk drawing
stretching stretching after workout
isn't terrible but there are some at
least mechanistic evidence that it
interferes with that patients set into
motion during training
um the stretch between sets is fine
extreme stretching may have hypertrophic
benefit but you can do that with load
instead of just stretching with yourself
was that ten fucking program uh fst
whatever c7 fascist stretch training
seven there's just seven sets they're
really there
i fucking tried that just for shits back
in the day and i remember just being
like this sucks so bad
why why
what do you think about fsc 7 i was like
i don't think it's a program designed by
someone who was thinking at the time so
i don't think about it just massive
about it yeah
uh
and then uh yeah so i think that's kind
of my answer james
yeah absolutely so um you don't
necessarily need to have a lot of
flexibility or mobility to have a fit
healthy lifestyle let's just put that
out there i mean the flexibility and
mobility needs are determined by the
activities that you want to do and the
lifestyle that you live now there's some
obvious ones right if you're so
inflexible that you can't do things
uh you know normal activities daily
living like tying your shoes for example
yeah that's a problem and then you might
consider adding some flexibility
mobility training so that you can do the
things that you want to do but um doing
it for its own sake
is completely up to you and it does come
with some trade-offs so first off i
think mike and i have both actually
written articles on this and i know that
i made a video on flexibility and
mobility training on this channel so you
can check that out too um so really kind
of the the quick and dirty on if you
want let's say that you've decided that
you are not sufficiently flexible for
whatever reason whether you just want to
there's something that you can't do that
you want you want to do or you just want
to be more flexible fine either way is
fine
generally
you are not going to do a lot of static
stretching before you work out or if you
are kind of metabolically cold meaning
like you wouldn't wake up first thing in
the morning and do a lot of static
stretching usually static stretching is
reserved for later in the day or kind of
post-workout times when your muscles are
nice and warm less prone to kind of just
accidental injuries and things like that
usually before you work out if you
decide that you want to work on
flexibility mobility is a good time to
do like an active warm-up and what we
would call like dynamic stretching which
is just kind of like low intensity kind
of moving through a nice full range of
motion probably mimicking some of the
movements that you're about to do so i
mean like the perfect way to stretch for
squatting is to do warm-up sets of
squatting for example right there you go
that's mobility right there so um you
can do some other stuff like some people
like to do some like you know high kicks
some hip you know uh what's it called
like hip hurdles and stuff like that you
can do that if you think it's beneficial
i find that if you're spending more than
like 10 or 15 minutes of that you're
probably just doing it for its own sake
and just wasting a lot of time when you
could just do probably about 10 minutes
of that get right into your warm-up
stats of whatever that you're doing for
that day and you are up and running and
then after your workouts you can include
things like static stretching and that's
usually kind of somewhere along the
lines of stretch and hold to the point
of discomfort for about 30 seconds and
rinse and repeat as needed you can do
more intensive forms of that which is
like the pnf stretching which by the way
if you guys have never done that that
fucking sucks uh proprioceptive
neuromuscular facilitation boom off the
cuff got it
damn that's one where it's kind of like
a stretch to the point of pain
contract the muscle sometimes by
yourself or using a partner really hard
and then like do a a
even further stretch than before
hold it's rough it is a rough one um
but here's kind of the the take-home
point is that uh you don't need to do a
ton of this stuff if you want to get
more flexible a little bit every day is
the the key so what you don't need to do
is spend an hour doing stretching like
the david goggins style he's really big
on doing that and for some people that's
what they like to do that's fine if you
want to gain a little bit more
flexibility and mobility over time
consistency is the key because this is
one of those adaptations that goes away
immediately once you stop doing it so
it's not necessary to provide like this
huge stimulus of stretching it's more of
stretch to the point of discomfort rinse
and repeat for a few sets do a little
bit of that every day and then you'll
start to make slow and steady progress
now the key is you have to pair that
with full range of motion resistance
training otherwise you actually never
develop the strength within that range
of motion
to prevent things like injuries as well
as to keep further potentiating gains
and flexibility mobility so that's what
dr mike said like sometimes you don't
even need to do any of this stuff if
you're training with the full range of
motion you actually just get
incrementally more flexible and more
mobile over time which is kind of the
goal so might not have to do that like
if you can do a full
bar to the floor sldl or if you can do
like a full stretch pec deck machine or
something like that like man you got
most of your boxes checked
so um just make the make the conscious
trade off of like do i want what
what is it that i want to be more
flexible and more mobile for am i just
doing this because i'm under the
assumption that i need to do it or is
there something that i'm actually trying
to do and if there is something that
you're trying to do that you can't do
then you can systematically approach it
just like all training stuff
boom
so what i heard from that is do tons of
hot yoga and pilates
i mean there's another reason why you
might go to a hot yoga or pilates class
but it might not be to be to be getting
more flexible
checking out all those hot dudes is what
i'm saying fuck yeah i want to see
the place between your dick and your
asshole gets sweaty and then i like to
imagine what it would be like down there
oh
i don't think i could do the hot yoga i
don't think i could do the hot stuff i
would just have a fucking some kind of
reaction just die in the corner no thank
you
that's it that's all i got uh all righty
well that was a pretty good one this
week folks thanks for sending in your
questions just a quick reminder if you
guys um are just joining us for the
first couple times the way it works is
people will submit their questions on
the most up-to-date q a and we'll take
the top ten and we do that by the most
upvoted uh questions so people will pop
them in there and if people go through
and look and they see ones that are
really good they'll upvote them and
we'll usually take the ones with the
highest upvotes or if we just happen to
see one that tickles our pickles then
we'll go forward too yes
i have a fun question for you guys to
answer in the comments below before we
sign out for the next video
see if you can find a realistic estimate
of jabba the hutt's maximal unassisted
translocation speed on a flat surface
my god
that's right like
you mean the how fast can he move or
like can you have a track and he move
because i was gonna say i can get a
tractor up in here we can move that fat
fuck
you try to lift him with a tractor half
his body comes up and then there's the
other half still there there's like
blood in your head you're like oh shit
jk shot uh i guess he can't be moved
no no no
not today um yeah i cannot get enough
job with the hud the more job of the hut
related questions we get the happier i
will be on a daily basis at these
training program you like hired us as
personal trainer you show up his tiny
little arms and seemingly no other
dexter surfaces and you're just like
a lot of dumbbell curls
super dirty
super nerdy tangent and then we'll wrap
up for today but uh i used to play d and
d a lot and they made a star wars d and
d uh for like the version three or
whatever three and a half um and you
could be a hot jedi so you could do a
character build of hut and so of course
i did i have so my friends and i we one
guy made like an ewok one guy was just
like a human guy um and i picked the
hutch one of the jedi classes i don't
remember which one and i was like this
will be so sweet until we got into a gun
battle and the hut can only move like
one square on the board per round where
it's like the ewok could move like 13 or
something so it's like they just shoot
you to death you can't do it you can't
move
i was like this character sucks it just
gets shot by blasters
yoda's dealing with young links it's all
in the power of the mind looks at a
hattie's young lady like you shouldn't
be in this course this is like recipe
for dessert
folks thanks for joining us again for
the bi-weekly q a great questions as
always dr mike any housekeeping on the
way out here no housekeeping tons of
stuff coming up but it's all top secret
so it should be out actually in about a
month maybe less all right folks see you
next time
