then yes as the video title says that is
going to kill your gains
you'll keep your leanness but you're not
going to add any real size
and your strength gains are also going
to be significantly compromised
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
and in this video today i want to
explain why going too
far with the whole gaintaining or main
gaining philosophy whatever you want to
call it
why that could potentially be slowing
down your muscle building progress or
even preventing you
from making any real muscle building
progress at all depending on exactly how
you're implementing it
so for those of you who are new to this
the idea behind
gaintaining is that instead of running
more traditional bulking and cutting
cycles where you switch between
definite periods of being in a calorie
surplus versus being in a calorie
deficit
instead of that you just eat around your
maintenance level and you focus on
slowly adding muscle without gaining fat
and
there are different approaches to this
so some people will say that you should
eat
literally right at your exact calorie
maintenance level with no surplus
whatsoever
whereas for others they'll still
consider a small surplus maybe
100 or 200 calories above maintenance
they'll still consider
that as main gaining and they'll only
classify it as bulking if you're going
into higher surpluses of
let's say 400 or 500 calories or more
above maintenance
so the first question is do you actually
need a calorie surplus in order to build
muscle and a lot of people out there
will give
a black and white yes or no answer to
this question but the real answer is
that it depends okay it depends on your
current body composition and it depends
on what exactly you mean by build muscle
so are we talking about
building some muscle but not necessarily
all the way to your maximum potential
or are we talking about 100 fully
optimized muscle growth
so in order to build muscle you need
protein which gives your body the raw
materials
to construct new muscle tissue and you
need calories to actually
carry out that construction process
remember that calories are ultimately
just energy
so for protein obviously you're going to
get that from your diet
0.8 to 1 grams per pound of body weight
daily is a pretty safe minimum and you
can go higher than that if you prefer
and then for calories you can either get
that from your diet by eating in an
energy surplus
or you can get it by using the calories
that your body already has stored
in your existing fat tissue so yes you
can build muscle without a calorie
surplus
if you have enough stored fat available
that your body is willing to burn off
and to divert to new
muscle growth so at higher body fat
levels this is no problem at all you
have plenty of stored fat available
and if there's a strong enough training
stimulus in place and you have enough
protein there your body will have no
issue with
reallocating some of those fat calories
and swapping them out for
new muscle growth so if you're
overweight you can eat in a calorie
deficit and lose fat
while gaining muscle at the same time if
you're skinny fat then you can do the
same thing even if you're already in
decent shape
but you're just carrying a bit of extra
fluff maybe let's say you are something
like 15 or 20
body fat then you can also do a standard
cutting phase
and if everything is on point in terms
of your training and nutrition then you
can probably
gain some muscle while you lean down at
the same time
however and this is a big however it's
very important to understand
that as you get leaner and leaner your
body is going to become
less and less willing to break down
stored fat and use those calories for
muscle growth because you only have
a finite amount of stored fat available
and fat
is obviously important for health and
for survival
so if you're truly eating at maintenance
meaning your
calorie intake exactly matches your
calorie expenditure
then the only place that your body can
get the calories from to build
new muscle is going to be from your fat
tissue it can't just create energy out
of thin
air and you can't just endlessly get
leaner and leaner
while gaining more and more muscle okay
you're not going to cut down to 10
body fat and then gain tan for the next
five years
and just continue losing fat while
gaining more and more muscle it doesn't
work like that
your body eventually is going to hit a
point where it's going to say
okay i get that there is this stressor
in the environment and then it's a
potential threat
which is your workouts but i can't
sacrifice any more body fat because i
just don't have enough
and even if i do add more muscle it's
gonna require more calories to maintain
it so unfortunately we just have to make
a trade-off
and we have to leave things as is
remember that your body is ultimately
just a survival and replication machine
and your hard-wired muscle building and
fat burning mechanisms really don't give
a crap about your desire to look
like your favorite instagram fitness
influencer your body is just trying to
find the most balanced state that it can
so that it can survive in the
environment based on the external
stressors that are there
and based on the calories and the
nutrients that are coming in and based
on how many calories it has
currently stored so it is not true that
you can
literally eat at maintenance where
calorie intake
precisely matches calorie expenditure
and continue gaining more and more
muscle over the long term
once you're already relatively lean okay
if you're on peds then that's going to
influence this
to some extent because that's going to
change the overall muscle building
environment in your body
and recompositioning is going to be a
lot more feasible especially if you have
good genetics to go along with it but
for natural trainees especially with
around average genetics
it's just not going to happen and this
is the big problem that i often see
people who are too caught up in the idea
of maintaining an aesthetic physique
they want to gain muscle but they're
terrified of gaining any body fat at all
and so they end up just keeping their
calories too low even though they're
already pretty lean
and they just end up spinning their
wheels and not really adding any
meaningful size over the long term
and i know some people are going to
disagree with this in the comments and
they're going to say nope
not true i've always eaten at my calorie
maintenance level and
i've gained muscle just fine so you
don't know what you're talking about but
the reality here is that no one
actually knows in the first place what
their exact calorie maintenance level
is since really that's impossible to
track there are way too many factors
that influence that
and it also fluctuates from day to day
and then on top of that
no one knows exactly how many calories
they're consuming either even if you
weighed
all of your foods right down to the
precise microgram there would still be
variation there
and when you weight train hard and
intensely your appetite is going to be
stimulated from that
and what very often happens is that as
long as someone isn't going out of their
way to restrict their calories
then they'll just naturally consume a
bit more food throughout the day to
compensate
and to match the hunger that they're
feeling and since they're still keeping
their diet under control overall and
they're just eating the satiation but
they're not indulging further than that
they think that that means that they're
eating at maintenance when they are in
fact
in a small calorie surplus they just
don't realize it though
you know even if it's just a couple
hundred extra calories and that's
because
their body is calibrating its hunger
cues to encourage them to eat more
because of that extra training stress it
wants more energy so that it can build
muscle without needing to sacrifice
body fat um and just think of it this
way if someone gains
body weight period aside from you know
the possibility of a bit of water and
glycogen weight
but if they are consistently gaining
overall body weight over the longer term
by definition that means they're in a
calorie surplus so if somebody starts
out at 150 pounds
and then after x amount of time now they
weigh 165 and they say that they did it
by
gaintaning and just eating at
maintenance you know that can't possibly
be true
there had to be an energy surplus there
for them to now be carrying
more total mass so what does this mean
for you
in practical terms well again if you're
overweight or skinny fat or you're in
decent shape but you're just carrying
a moderate amount of excess fat then yes
you can eat in a calorie deficit
lean down and if you're training your
diet is on point then you'll gain muscle
during that process and the amount of
muscle that you'll gain specifically
that's going to depend on factors like
how much body fat you're actually
carrying
what your training experience is your
diet and workout structure
your genetics etc but once you are
relatively lean
okay 12 11 10 body fat or even lower
than that
if you want to continue gaining
significant muscle over the long term
you are going to need periods of eating
in a net calorie surplus
in order for that to happen and if
you're obsessed with being lean
you know the slightest little blur on
your abs causes you to
have an anxiety attack you refuse to
bump your calories up at all any
increase on the scale
mentally upsets you then yes as the
video title says
that is going to kill your gains you'll
keep your leanness but you're not going
to add any real size
and your strength gains are also going
to be significantly compromised
now all of that said that does not mean
that you need a massive calorie surplus
to make solid gains
and it doesn't mean that you need to get
fat during the process not at all
dirty bulking is a complete waste of
time and effort i've been there and done
that and i can tell you it's not the
route you want to go and i don't need to
tell you that
because you can just clearly see for
yourself right here that again that is
not
the road you want to go down your body
can only use a limited amount of
calories per day for building new muscle
anything beyond that will just be stored
as fat and you can stay
relatively lean while you gain muscle as
long as you go about it properly so
if by gaintaning or main gaining we're
talking about a small calorie surplus
uh maybe anywhere from let's say 100 to
300 calories above maintenance depending
on the individual
then i would completely agree with that
approach because that should be a high
enough amount
to build muscle optimally or let's say
at least close to optimally
but it will be small enough that uh body
fat levels will be kept under control
they will increase to some degree
but it's going to be so minor and it's
going to happen so slowly that you're
going to see it happening from a mile
away and you can just adjust your
approach
and modify things as you go so this
really all depends on what someone's
precise definition of gaintaining
actually is but
in any case even though a surplus will
be necessary if you want to make
significant gains
once you're already decently lean it's
also not mandatory that you do a long
drawn-out phase in a calorie surplus
followed by a long drawn-out cutting
phase you don't necessarily have to go
three months or six months doing a
longer term bulk and then spend
maybe eight or twelve weeks or whatever
doing a cut
you can definitely do that if you want
there's nothing wrong with it you know
if you're making consistent gains you've
got that muscle building and
strength gaining momentum and you're
comfortable with your body fat levels
during the process and you don't mind
maybe cutting for a bit longer down the
line if you're okay with that then by
all means do that but the other option
if leanness is a priority for you and
also preferably if you do have a bit
more experience
so that you can really implement this
effectively what you can also do is just
run
shorter surplus and deficit cycles so
eat in a calorie surplus
for several weeks rather than several
months keep an eye on your body fat
levels once you've gotten a bit softer
than you'd like
drop into a quick deficit strip off the
excess fat and then just rinse and
repeat you know i don't see anything
wrong with that approach
as long as you execute it properly and
you truly give yourself
those periods with a definite surplus if
you're training a solid and you're
eating enough protein
then by doing that you should be able to
consistently gain muscle
while staying relatively lean over the
longer term but you'll just have a
slight ebb and flow in your body fat
levels
rather than trying to keep them
perfectly stable all the time now it's
hard to assign
an exact time frame to this because a
lot of it will just come down to
improvisation
based on your individual needs and
preferences okay there's no need to say
from the outset that
this is precisely how long you're going
to be in a surplus for and this is
precisely how long
you're going to stay in a deficit i
would say just play it by ear and then
run a quick deficit whenever you feel
like it's appropriate and
the duration and the size of that
deficit is going to depend on
exactly what degree of leanness you're
aiming for how much fat you've put on as
well as your own preferences
in terms of whether you prefer faster or
slower
cuts but for example if you are going to
use a shorter term approach like this
it could be anywhere from let's say
three to six weeks and a small surplus
and then anywhere from maybe one to two
weeks in a deficit but
really that's just a rough estimate
because there are so many different ways
that you could ultimately do this
and one method that i'm personally
experimenting with something i've never
done before
but that is to eat in a small calorie
surplus around 200 above maintenance or
so
focus on gaining monitor things and then
based on how my physique is looking body
fat wise
here and there i'll just add in anywhere
from one to three days of what's called
a protein-sparing modified fast
which is where you eat in a larger
calorie deficit and you pair it with
very high protein
with the idea being to quickly drop some
excess body fat while maintaining the
muscle
and then go right back to your surplus
again and i'll report my experience with
that
after i've been doing it for a while
here if you found this advice helpful
and you want to learn exactly how to tie
this all together
as far as an actual step-by-step eating
plan goes so the proper number of
calories that you need the
macronutrients recommended food choices
