hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
here is a fitness myth
that harder cardio leads to more fat
loss every time
what that's a myth well let's take a
look at the claim and how it's
structured in most cases
so it is true
that cardio can be graded on a scale of
perceived exertion basically what feels
harder
starts roughly from something like
walking which if that feels hard to you
holy shit i guess after a few uh a few
hundred meters it could start to be a
drag
then it goes to incline walking it's a
bit harder because that's an incline
then jogging then running then
multiple sprints high intensity interval
training etc all of them get
perceptively much harder during the act
of the act
and
because they're hard and people
generally think hard things make me
better at stuff which is not entirely a
bad view a lot of people think okay
the cardio that feels the hardest is
going to be the one that makes me the
leanest
it's going to lead to more fat loss
and if you are stalling and you're not
getting lean doing whatever you're doing
make your cardio harder or throw in
harder cardio and it will get the job
done well there are a variety of reasons
that that's probably not true at least
four
first
the way cardio burns fat
almost entirely
is
you have the duration of how long you're
doing cardio
and that's on the x-axis and on the
y-axis is how many calories does that
cardio burn per minute let's see
and you start cardio let's say it's easy
cardio and it's for 30 minutes yeah you
know burn never burns a lot of calories
but it burns pretty continuously and
after 30 minutes of stops
it's the area
under that curve
that determines how many total calories
and thus fat you burn
if you do psychotically hard cardio
that's insane it can burn a ton of
calories per minute but you ain't gonna
be doing that shit for 30 minutes more
like two if it's like a super crazy
sprint and you breathe and rest for a
long time
the area under this curve
tall and skinny could not be very
impressive right so
yes
the higher intensity cardio per minute
allows you to burn more calories
however
almost by design you cannot last as long
doing ultra hard super intense cardio as
you can doing easier cardio
so harder cardio is for sure harder
it points that curve in the upper
direction
but this curve that's easier might
actually be burning as many or more
calories right
the thing is
in the human body
this is actually exaggerated
to where cardio the harder it is isn't
linearly less sustainable it's
exponentially less sustainable
so
if you
can walk at three miles an hour
and someone says walk until you fall
down maybe you got that fucking it was
like an x-men movie where that bitch was
like propagandizing people with her
touch or whatever and she was like walk
until your feet bleed or something and
the guy took off anyway uh if someone
says like walk forever
as long as you can until you fall over a
lot of people could walk like man 20 or
30 miles until they're like my feet are
bleeding i can't do this anymore all
right
what if someone says sprint until you
can't sprint anymore
even if they give you a 10 or 15 second
or one minute break between every sprint
to get as much energy back as you can at
what point are you going to quit
well
how many calories does it take to walk
20 or 30 miles probably a few thousand
are you really going to do a few
thousand calories of sprinting get the
fuck out of here 500 calories in a
sprint workout your legs won't work for
five days afterwards and you're sure as
hell quit and you might even die right
so it turns out that relationship
between sustainability and effort is
exponential in the human body which is
to say harder cardio is much less
sustainable you can do much less of it
per any unit time
per hour per day per week and thus if
you want a realistic approach to cardio
which as we know if it's super
sustainable you can do a lot of it and
burn lots of fat
that's the opposite of doing harder
cardio this advice would probably be
more true backwards if someone said hey
the easier the cardio is the more fat
you burn that's more true than the other
way around no joke
now having said that
some people say hold on a sec dr mike
you scientist fuck
you miss something in your science
school
what about excess post
exercise oxygen consumption epoc
much better to call it epoc it sounds
very fancy
it's really the caloric cost of the
recovery from cardio so if you walk for
10 miles and then you sit down
you have elevated hormonal levels and
you need to repartition some nutrients
and heal some things but not much and
you barely burn any more calories than
we would expect like if you're seated
for 30 minutes
then you walk for 30 minutes and then
you sit down for 30 minutes
the amount of calories you're burning
that second 30 minutes after you sat
down already after the cardio is
basically the same as the first no big
deal
however
if you sit for 30 minutes and we measure
how many calories you're burning per
minute and then we have you do
high-intensity interval training for
let's say five minutes and then you sit
around for another 30 minutes for at
least the first part of that 30 minutes
you're going to be burning way more
calories per minute than it would expect
a lot of it's actually quite obvious the
excess post exercise oxygen consumption
actually reveals itself and your
breathing frequency and your tidal
volume so after you do high intensity
interval training well after you do
regular walking 30 minutes or someone's
like oh you're 30 minutes is over please
sit down on your chair he shuts down
i wonder if i'm in a cia
exam room and the fuck is going on but
if you do high intensity interval
training as soon as you sit down after
five minutes of that shit you're like
that shit burns calories that's
literally you taking in more oxygen to
burn more calories to fix all the shit
you essentially broke and all the fuel
that you wasted away during that time
and people will say to hold on that
epoch that trailing edge after hard
cardio sums up to a lot of calories and
they're right it does sum up to a lot
but it doesn't sum up to as much in most
cases as just doing easier cardio for
longer
all right so yes you do get an after
burn effect from high-intensity interval
training but if you add up all those
calories ah man it's just not as many as
we would have hoped for and if you just
want went on an incline treadmill for an
hour you could have burned so many
calories that it would take you an
unbelievably unsustainable amount
of high intensity interval training to
make up for that even counting the epoc
afterburn effect so unfortunately that
falls a bit
short number three
pedantic point
but direct fuel use of what fuel you're
actually using is it proteins is it
carbs of fats the lower your intensity
the more like incline walking your
cardio is
the higher percentage of fat is used at
that time now
the fat is used a ton for recovery and
the hit and stuff like that so it's not
a big point but if we're going to be
real pedantic you actually burn a
higher fraction of fat in low intensity
anyway
and
here's the big kicker fatigue
we already mentioned how tired hard
cardio makes you and how not very
sustainable it is to do regularly in the
kinds of volumes we need to burn lots of
calories however we didn't talk about
joint wear and tear
people say well i'll just do high
intensity interval training five days a
week really
on what machine like while on the
treadmill i'll run real fast and i'll
slow down around fast slow down sweet
let me know in one and a half weeks how
your knees feel and usually they're like
fuck my knees or damn near coming off my
body and i can't feel my ankles oh shit
ultra hard cardio
tends to fuck up your joints more that's
not a bad thing it's just as much as a
known cost like i do brazilian jiu jitsu
it fucks my joints i'm cleanly my thumb
right now by the way is completely
different size than the other one it
barely works i don't know what's going
on with that i mean i know when i don't
know what happened but trying to gui
teen someone anyway
joint pain is a part of life and sure as
hell is a part of sport and physical
activity if you have lots of fat to burn
over weeks and months you want to pick
the shit that hurts your joints least
because look you're probably still
resistance training you might do other
sports your joints take a beating there
you don't want them taking a beating
from cardio and cardio is by definition
so repetitive and so incessant that if
it's hurting your joints in a
non-sustainable way that shit's going to
get really out of hand really fast
there is a cap to how much joint
disruption you can have until it takes
off exponentially and your joints really
start to get bad over the course of
weeks and days in that cap of physical
activity is usually below what it would
take to just burn all the fat you want
through really really high demanding
cardio like sprints like so i'll just do
40 meter repeat 95 sprints to do all my
fat burning uh holy fuck you might have
to do like 10 of those a day to get the
same that you would the same calorie
burning as you would for 30 minutes on a
treadmill just walking like okay that
seems fine really 10 40 meter sprints
per day six days a week you will fucking
fry your hips and knees and ankles off
of your body in a few weeks if you're
not used to that sort of thing so you
couldn't say well i'll just ramp up
slowly that would work but why
why why not just do the 30 minutes of
cardio it's not that big of a deal
consider that
all right but as you consider it here
are some grains of truth
this is a kicker this is this is
important
if you only have a short time to train
let's say you're super busy professional
executive and right now you're in
business class and you're like oh why
not watch a dr mike youtube video
that might have happened once ever
if you only have
let's say
30 minutes six times per week or four
times a week to train
and
that's cardio wise let's say you take
your weight training some some other
time if you only have like four or six
days a week 30 minutes at a time
to do cardio you better go hard because
that's not enough time to really fuck
yourself up unless you're doing like
actual sprints
incline walking it's fine but you can
get an elliptical and really rock hard
because it won't fuck up your joints a
ton but you got to work much harder than
just walking because you just don't have
that much time look if you're a
bodybuilder you don't have a day job
you're sponsored by a supplement company
you could do an hour of card in the
morning and an hour in the evening it's
all low incline whatever that's fine but
if you're super busy you can't jam it in
and you only have a small amount of time
per the week to do cardio
two things one you need to burn as many
calories as possible so it's not if you
go hard but also you can't actually
impose a ton of fatigue and a ton of
joint fatigue because you just don't
have the opportunity to do that much
work so you should be pretty close to
maxing out all those times same works
for weight training by the way if you
only have a few minutes here and there
to train with weights you better be
doing alternating compound supersets
push and pull
you know
10 to 30 seconds rest between sets go go
go compound movements you're going to
feel insane like death at the end but
you got to push it hard if you don't
have a lot of time to push it if you
want really really good results
now
if you can maintain the duration of
cardio and keep it sustainable
harder cardio does burn more fat so if
you have like an hour you know let's say
you have an hour five days a week to do
your cardio and you've just been on a
low incline treadmill at two and a half
miles an hour and you're looking things
going well i'm losing fat but i think
you can push it and you're just not
fatigued at all
try three miles an hour and uh you know
a five percent incline instead of a two
percent incline you will burn more
calories
uh you will burn more fat if you can
maintain that duration still whatever an
hour five days a week and it's still
sustainable if then then great then then
do it so we're saying here isn't that
hard cardio is bad unsustainably hard
cardio is bad because it's short-sighted
harder cardio will burn more fat it's
healthier too by a long shot if you want
maximum body health for longevity and
quality of life the more
unreal cardio shape you're in the better
health you'll be almost one-to-one so if
you want to push the cardio to get
healthy amazing sustainability is a
factor but amazing nonetheless and it'll
just get you in fucking amazing shape so
if you can go harder and you want to go
harder and sustainability and duration
is not an issue fuck and go harder you
don't need to be doing a mile an hour on
the flat treadmill you don't want to
overdo it go hard just not too hard
that's the real big thing
so
best practice if you're in a situation
in which you're very constrained for
time
the best all-around exercise is probably
still
short rest high volume resistance
training for sets of 10 to 30 reps do as
many pull-ups as you can or pull downs
do as many push-ups as you can repeat
that five times with 10-second break
between pull-ups and push-ups and then
between the other round 30-second break
so you're basically
the entire time and then as soon as
you've done that go to the squats and
then superset them with shoulder presses
or something boom boom boom just like
that you could pick like six total
exercises 20 minutes later you're fucked
your whole body's fucked in the best way
possible it's not sustainable to do for
two hours good news you don't have two
hours
on top of that
if you have time to do cardio do the
cardio that's fun and sustainable
so if that's hard cardio great and
here's another thing it doesn't have to
be either or
if you have six days a week in which you
can do cardio
three of them can be slow walking on an
incline treadmill super sustainable
two of them can be very high intensity
interval training not sustainable but
it's only two no big deal and then one
of them can be moderate on the
elliptical that's six sessions and
because they're different modalities and
not all of them are hard some are easy
some are hard some are moderate
the cumulative fatigue over the course
of the week essentially falls to close
to zero and then you can sustain it so
it doesn't have to be like oh no hard
cardio is bad too much heart card is bad
but some is totally fine as long as it
fits into your plan
that being said
if you want to make the most serious
attempt you can possibly make it being
very very lean and getting much leaner
low intensity high volume cardio
essentially incline walking maybe some
slow elliptical
is probably the best type of cardio from
a stimulus to fatigue perspective the
stimulus being how many calories can it
burn and the fatigue being how much does
it screw you up for everything else and
fuck up your joints
almost all the leanest people in the
world which are to say competitive
bodybuilders do this kind of cardio and
very little else
and
there's no obvious way
in which going harder than this
will get you leaner
if going harder on cardio got people
predictably leaner
a lot more pro bodybuilders would be
doing it and yeah sure maybe they're
lazy
but
many bodybuilders at a high level have
figured out that if they try to go
really hard on the cardio
they get more injuries
way more fatigue it fucks up their
training and for sure fucks up their leg
training and it doesn't actually seem to
make them that much leaner whereas if
they go easier on the cardio just do
plenty of it everything is really good
and they get lean consistently no it's
not as fun look incline treadmill
walking is like some kind of fucking
death torture i don't wish that shit on
my worst enemies
but if it gets the job done and it gets
job done the best it's probably a good
idea to use
the way to cheat around that
is the new generation of shit get you a
step tracker any model works
10 to 15 000 steps per day on average
control the diet
reduce the nutrients as much as it takes
to get you to lose a certain percent per
week and voila you're on your way to
being ultra lean
all you have to do is walk around and do
normal shit throughout the day get on
the treadmill to make up what you don't
have at the end of the day or some other
time you're good to go so yeah that's
not very hard as a matter of fact right
now i do basically no cardio at all i
just track my steps i hit a minimum of
whatever currently i'm massing so it's 9
000 a day at least no more than 10 on
average and then i eat whatever i need
to
that those two components keep that
equation solid and get me whatever it is
that my genetics can allow that's it no
need to do cycle hard cardio
and i'll say one last thing
a lot of people tend to go to hard
cardio
to feel like they're really doing
something
to feel like they're making an effort
when you're on like three miles an hour
and a five grade on the treadmill and
you're like and watching netflix while
you're moving you can kind of feel like
fuck i'm trying to lose fat right i'm
barely even trying i could go way faster
than this like what the fuck like this
doesn't seem like you know one of those
like montages for like a rocky movie
like rocky ran and up pills and shit
fuck am i doing
sustainability is what you're doing
you're doing the right thing
it's easy as a human with our with with
our non-robotic flawed emotions to be
like oh i could go harder now yes but
remember your goal weight loss is in 12
weeks and if you can just get on that
treadmill for an hour every day and
watch your netflix series you're gonna
be in fucking amazing shape if that's
too easy for you
fuck get another hobby shooting yourself
with a fucking gun in the foot something
real hard
fat loss is too easy we are too advanced
as a society
