video the day after Valentine's Day
so here's how Cupid motherfucker put his
arrows in his sheath flew off his little
dumbass baby wing and looking for
motherfuckers to shoot and he looked at
me and he's like oh you're married
already and I'm like yep to Dr Crystal
he's like what up I'm like what up say
all right you're good keep come on
flying on to his next ship then he flew
over to Mr chair feather and he was like
haha I'm gonna zap this dumbass dude and
Jared was like just grab the arrow cue
Vegeta theme not today Cupid and then he
just crunched it in the arrow fell the
cupid is like holy shit he flew away and
then Cupid flew his dumb little ass to
these two lovebirds who are
clearly in insane romantic love actually
they weren't until yesterday when
Valentine's Day they were actually
standing like like this like like she
was in front he was in the back the cube
is like yo watch this bam and the arrow
went through both of them
okay and then they got the air out oh
God we're in love with each other let's
celebrate how real lovers do
what is the quintessential unity in love
every really romantic movie at least two
here
hey Jerry you beat me too oh oh I have
evidence Titanic what happened to the
motherfucker nothing good uh Romeo and
Juliet that turned out okay didn't it
wait it did today couples leg day
camp
a match made in heaven but I don't see
any Heaven around I see a big ass Dragon

where the fuck is Cupid when you need
him cupid is taking the day off work so
hard on Valentine's Day Jared we're
gonna step in for him and uh you guys
feeling uh loving the air yeah we're
about to die together
that's that romance shit Hollywood time
hit it
first seated like curls
I don't know why I'm doing this Maya rep
match sets as usual
because in our opinion isolation
exercises like lead curls you're in
there already
it's easy to rest in the machine it's
easy to approach failure multiple times
with a my match as a reminder or those
of you new the channel we do one set
very close to failure that's the
Baseline set that's set number one the
first set is a straight set the set
after is a my rep set where you take a
little five to ten second breaks in
order to get those totals that'll be the
theme for kind of the rest of this
workout but don't tell our lovely two
contestants because uh yeah that's kind
of bad news for them fuck that I just
tell them what to do let's get it done

you guys feeling good so we're done
right you guys see this laughter you
guys see that laughter everybody got
jokes until the hack squatting starts
we're not nice people Jared and I
everyone knows this so we've been doing
a lot of pretty heavy hacks today these
folks are gonna be doing something much
harder than that they are going to be
doing hack squats but we're going to try
to pick a load that they can mile rep
their way per each set to about 15 to 25
reps which means we're gonna start with
a weight that they can do 20 to 25 reps
with keep that weight pretty close to
the same and then fatigue will break
them down from there my rep traditional
style this time so even the first set is
gonna have two or three little five to
ten second breaks so you get a little
bit more win in their sales and then go
again for another few reps this gets Us
close to failure multiple times
throughout the set which means after
this we just don't have a lot left to do
we're still gonna do some shit but we
like at RP to take an exercise and
really milk the fucking dog shit out of
it do you milk dog shit is that where
dog shit comes from you guys know what
I'm saying really do it right really do
it intensely so you don't have to do 50
different exercises in the gym and when
you pull up your shit on your you know
what I'm saying RP training
uh the shit will say hack spots and
you're not you're not thinking oh man I
wish I could do more you're thinking
