hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
at the time of this recording i just did
and won
a bodybuilding show which is why the
tenor of my skin
is a little bit shade different than it
was in the last video in the series
so my health is fine my liver is not
dying
uh thanks for checking in let's get into
nutrition myths number nine
biohacking oh boy prepare for extensive
eye rolling as usual we're going to talk
about the claim
we're going to talk about reasons why
it's wrong we're going to talk about
some grains of truth because most of
these claims have a little bit of a
silver lining to bring
and then we're going to talk about okay
knowing that all this stuff is the way
it is
what are some best practices we can take
to actually increase fitness
in with a reasonable expectation and not
make a ton of mistakes so here's the
deal about
biohacking i'm sure you guys have seen
these claims a ton
tons of supplement ads entire
generations of podcasters and fitness
and
fitness influencers essentially sort of
brand themselves as bio hackers they
have books about biohacking
what is it it's a claim that you can
hack your body systems
like you would hack a computer and that
you can essentially trick them
into doing what you want right you can
just reprogram your biology
and this isn't my quote this is like a
quote you can google
reprogram your biology and say
biohacking hit search you'll get like 10
trillion results of people
actually saying this they say you can
reprogram your biology somehow
i know a little bit of biology i have no
idea how the hell that works but
supposedly
you can get your body triggered into
burning more fat
building more muscle becoming healthier
having lots more energy
you name it you can hack your weight to
it and it's
easy and it's quick because it's a trick
that's the big claim it's effortless
like a shortcut
or a cheat code in a video game all
right when someone says hey i got a
cheat code for something
you don't exactly anticipate it to be
unbelievably hard you think oh my god
wow
this is like a magic fix right so
biohacking has that magic element to it
now that's what it is that's the claim
why is it wrong well a couple of real
good reasons first of all
your body is not a computer and you
don't
hack it okay where's the mp3 port you
know
it's just not it is a wildly complex
system that does not operate like a
computer in many
very important ways saying that it does
is the worst kind of sleazy salesmanship
you can imagine
we live at the beginning at the dawn of
the real computer generation
and computers are so unbelievably
flexible and powerful and they do have
so many shortcuts
that we analogize them as customers
to something that is an incredibly good
thing to have
like you know when people say more
powerful than a locomotive or a freight
train
that analogies like freight trains are
really powerful
i want to be more like a freight train
but if this creatine pill says be
powerful like a locomotive that's what i
want because locomotives are much more
powerful than humans
computers much more flexible than humans
they can instantly change their
programming to get you a ton of
different outputs
without a ton of laborious efforts
matter of fact they were invented
specifically
to remediate the problem of laborious
effort and lack of programming
so people are using this computer
analogy to be like hey like you like
things easy like on computers right and
like
you look hackers can get stuff in and
quick and change it and
make a bunch of money or alter the
program to do something else and you
want that right you're like um
they're like you also want to burn fat
right you're like uh-huh like well your
body's a computer
we're gonna hack it for you're like i
love all the hacking movies
i've always wanted to be hacked this is
going to be great it's going to be
effortless
and unfortunately that's just bs because
losing fat and gaining muscle is only
done best
by understanding of the deep principles
behind them
but it's hard work a better analogy
than that of hacking a computer for
changing your fitness
is like building a working rocket i know
i use the rocket analogy a lot
but it's a pretty decent analogy i think
and here's why
how do you build a decent how do you
build a working rocket that
leaves or you know breaks exit velocity
leaves and goes into space
you have to study engineering textbooks
a whole lot and they absolutely greatly
enhance the process
versus you just trying it yourself look
like when rockets were first engineered
in the you know 1910s 20s 30s 40s
and they were still trying to figure out
the principles there was no engineering
textbook really to figure out there's no
principles of rocket design the textbook
didn't exist they had to do things the
hard way of course that's crappy that's
the same as in fitness
in the 1920s they didn't really know
should you eat more protein what about
carbs
what should a calorie deficit be
magnitude-wise how long should a diet be
how should you lift weights a lot of the
stuff was mysterious and people had to
figure it out themselves that for sure
sucks
but instead of hacking our way to the
results what we have is the equivalent
and fitness
of an engineering textbook like you
probably can get a textbook called
principles of rocket design
it's a tough textbook you gotta work
through that thing
it greatly enhances the process but
nothing replaces hard work
okay nobody hacks a fucking rocket into
space
it's not a trick it is a very detailed
execution plan
it requires tons of effort tons of money
times time and that
investment over time builds a
functioning beautiful thing
like a rocket that it accomplishes a
very specific mission reliably
just the same way in fitness what you do
is you invest
invest invest prepare plan execute on
the principles
and slowly but surely the results come
and eventually the results are really
awesome
but there's no little little loop trick
to get there any faster and anyone
selling it to you
is probably just trying to make a
shitload of money while lying to you
right
here's another problem people that look
for tricks and shortcuts almost always
fail
for two reasons mainly one is tricks and
shortcuts don't exist
so they fail because that's you know
that little quicker road through the
woods leads right into a mountain
okay but the other one is that the kind
of people
that really want to shortcut are a
self-selected group
that is um a little bit resistant to
work
they don't want to put in there they
haven't accepted the fact that they're
going to have to grind a little bit
and the people that aren't ready to work
probably will fail
because they won't put in the work so
biohacking
is all the worst combination of trying
to sell ineffective things in the worst
possible ways to the specific
demographic that is most likely to fail
at them
that's why it's bs now some grains of
truth to the idea behind it and why
people
get caught up in it here's the thing you
definitely want the easiest way to get
results okay nobody's saying
you should work harder than needed like
for example
if you're a runner and there's a running
shoe that reduces angle and knee pain
and lets you run the same distances and
paces
more now because you don't have ankle
and knee pain and it's more sustainable
and it only costs 50 bucks
no one in the right mind would be like
fuck that bro you run barefoot and
you're like but my knees and ankles are
killing me like no man
you just know you just don't want work
like what it's like someone would say
don't buy a lifting belt or
weightlifting shoes or straps
because then you know your deadlift and
bent over roll will go up too much and
your legs will get too big like no but
these are tools that we want to use
but but versa grips for a bent row isn't
exactly a hack
it's just a principle-based tool it's
not going to instantly make your back
bigger with no work it's going to
magnify your ability to work
and get you better results that's the
real thing we're looking for
not the hacks right but we are trying to
do things
easier but realistically easier in a way
that can make them better
right knowing nuances of biology for
example
knowing ratios of carbs and fat knowing
some nutrient timing knowing what kind
of foods to choose
knowing these nuances can make the
results from
your intervention more certain okay if
you know the principles and the nuances
then you can be like okay i need to lose
x amount of weight by february i know
exactly how to do that because i know
how to track bodyweight i know how to
manipulate calories and if you didn't
then you'd be like yeah i know where to
eat less i don't know how much you
couldn't be
very certain of the results you would
achieve you know maybe i'll lose 12
pounds maybe i lose 15.
so it can make you more certain knowing
the nuances it can make the effect
larger in magnitude
like if you know the nuances and how to
really choose foods and choose exercises
and make a plan
you can maybe lose 15 pounds instead of
12 right which is a good thing
i notice it's not lose 30 pounds instead
of zero like the biohackers would have
you believe
but it is a little bit of a benefit and
it is
another benefit if you know the nuances
some of which the biohackers share every
now and again
you can get there easier just a little
bit easier
instead of by brute force okay so you
know people will say
sometimes sarcastically sometimes not in
various usually anonymous social media
like
if you talk about the details of your
diet especially if you're not super
ripped
and you're like oh i'm going to be
losing 15 pounds here and i'm doing this
and i'm cutting my macros and doing
meals
people will say things like just eat
less fucking simple
like yeah but if i eat a lot less
then maybe i'm working super hard to get
a good result
maybe i can work not as hard have more
energy more time for other things in my
life
and still get the same result as a
matter of fact i could get a larger
magnitude result and it could be more
certain so it absolutely pays
so we're not saying here like there's no
way to hack the body at all there's no
nuance there's no trick there's no like
little corners you can cut there are
little corners you can cut there aren't
big corners you can cut
and that's the main difference right
easier making things easier and slightly
more effective is not the same thing as
hacking
okay fitness is not like hacking a bank
account and just getting easy money in
your account fitness
is like opening a bank account with
reasonable rates
getting a really good job like that's
all you need to know stuff for that or
to just randomly get a good job
and over time depositing into the bank
account and seeing that bank account
steadily grow
look if you don't know how to get a good
job if you don't know what a good bank
account is
if you don't know how to save money
you're not going to have money at the
end of the day
after many many years just the same way
if you don't know any of the principles
of fitness
including the nuances then you're not
going to be fit at the end of whatever
three
six or 12 months but that
is just some marginal tools you can do
over time and they add up add up add up
it's not a hack can you imagine a movie
like ocean's 13 or some shit
where they're like we're gonna make tons
of money and they're like all right how
like we're gonna fucking open up a
profitable business that provides a
valuable good
and service and we're going to invest in
it over time and expand and hire
marketing people
in 30 years we're going to have a
multinational corporation like what
that sucks i wanted a money like
tomorrow and like a billion dollars and
some car chases in italy
right that's what biohacking promises
you on the diet side and it's
just not real so don't fall for it
now don't fall for biohacking where are
we leaving
where are the best practices here
because we have to give you some advice
biohacking is bad but what do i do
first learn the principles of diet and
training
you can do a lot of that learning just
watching these youtube videos so
tune in to our channel there's tons of
other great channels learn learn
learn you can check out our books
there's tons of other great books
nothing replaces learning as far as
knowing the principles and then all this
fitness mystery is not a mystery at all
it's just a matter of i know exactly
what i need to do
now i just have to execute it's awesome
if you don't want to do all that it's
totally cool maybe you don't have the
time
hire someone that can do it for you hire
a really good coach
hire uh you know maybe follow a good
coach for some tips
uh potential paying people directly to
coaches probably the best way
uh maybe download an app like the rp
diet app shameless plug
and that tells you what to do and then
it's off your hands you pay a little bit
of money you pay a little money either
way you get really great guidance
but something principled something that
gives you this road map of okay here's
how you work not like here's this magic
thing and it's going to solve all your
problems
that's bullshit don't fall for that
number two
essentially the analogy here is
all of these fitness resources be it the
coach or be it books or videos
learning the actual lay of the land is
basically
if the analogy is hiking it's going to
teach you how to pack your bag
it's going to teach you at what pace to
hike what's too fast what's too slow
how to make camp and how to navigate
your journey and if you know all that
you're going to get from point a to
point b and see some cool stuff you're
going to be great at hiking
biohacking is like saying there's a
helicopter ride or a shortcut to get to
the mountain that takes 15 minutes
instead of 15 days
that do not fall for because no
helicopter is coming and if you don't
know how to hike you're in a bad way if
you're halfway through your hike so make
sure you understand
that dietary principles and training
principles offer you the best path
through difficulty and you still have to
go through difficulty and anyone that
says look
there's this best path with zero
difficulty it's likely they are bs
unless they're like a pharmaceutical
company and they finally have a fat loss
pill i'm still waiting for that shit
but until that comes there's no
biohacking yet
here's another thing i work for
renaissance periodization
here's our youtube channel it is a
for-profit company
if we had biohacks don't you think we'd
fucking try to sell them to you good
god if we had some kind of pill or some
kind of like
trippy diet that just sliced off body
fat made you super jacked and it didn't
have any side effects
don't you think we'd be pushing that why
would we be why would we not
right and if you have this amazing
product why hasn't it
let's say we didn't discover it somebody
else did where the hell is that company
where the hell are they making everyone
fit like if a real product works
people adopt it like when they invented
the washing machine after a few years a
few decades
everyone had one and someone who was
washing their own clothes can you
imagine that like you're
it's the 70s and they're washing their
own clothes people you know you ever
heard of a washing machine they're like
nah that's a biohack bullshit claim like
no this is real man it really works it's
really cheap
saves you tons of labor that is a hack
right so to speak but if engineered
again
but you know it's obvious when that
stuff really works
if you see a book like a new york times
bestseller book by someone that's like
hack your body for unreal fitness you're
like
still lots of unfit people around like
there's almost no one around that
doesn't use a washing machine
so it's kind of like either they're
selling me tons of bs or maybe like i'd
just be a first adopter and i'd be one
of the new
the only people that get these great
results uh or something's going on
probably the bs in most cases so
definitely have an open mind
but when you see incredible claims
demand incredible evidence or maybe just
don't risk being a first adopter be
smart
do your best great results
accumulate over your concerted effort
over time
know what to do learn all the stuff you
can tune into our channel
execute prepare to work don't work
inefficiently
work hard work smart don't hope for a
hack
it's on you to get fit no one's coming
to help you except yourself
folks thanks for tuning in see you next
time
