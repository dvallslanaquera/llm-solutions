hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization
strength training made simple number 16
the last video unless we choose to add
more later
troubleshooting lack of progress folks
don't watch this video unless
you've probably seen all the other 15
videos before they're giving you the
core and a ton of great answers to your
strength training questions
now you might be in a position where
you've watched all those videos and shit
you might have even applied
all of the strategies in them and you're
still in a rut
and you don't know what to do because
you're not making the progress either
that you want
or any progress at all so if something
is stuck be one lift or all lifts or
something
you can look at this list here and it's
eight points long
and these are sequential points of
attack to go
am i doing this right am i checking this
box if you're not
you know what to work on so let's just
get started real quick number one
you want appropriate generally
appropriate training what's that watch
the other 15 videos
and consistent training and a decent
diet that's consistent the entire time
so if you say man my bench won't go up
and i'm like what's your bench training
like and you're like well it's kind of
different
all the time and i haven't been super
consistent i gotta yeah yeah get out of
my face
do something consistently and like eight
times out of ten it'll just solve itself
you're like you know i started benching
consistently and eating well enough
protein calories and my bench is going
up
like wow that's weird that problem was
solved by actually doing what you said
you were doing so
consistency first if you're a coach and
i know a lot of you guys are or personal
trainer
and someone asks you hey i need help
with xyz lyft
you just straight up ask them number one
or just try to investigate how
consistent they have been
because all the crazy advanced sport
science advice in the world
doesn't mean anything unless the
person's consistently applying at least
something to start with right like
someone could tell you look i'm having
real
trouble designing an aircraft and you're
like oh okay if you tried designing one
like not really
like how can you say you're having
trouble on it do you know how to draw
like
no i didn't know i was supposed to be
like drawing it like what
so some people are like man my bench
won't go up and like have you been
really like training bench consistently
and they're like
not really and you're like right so
number one
always first number two mev to mrv
training
training within the volume landmarks the
amount of volume that is stimulative
for all the muscle groups or all of the
lifts okay
so you could be in a situation where
like man my squat's not going up but
they squat like
three total working sets per week like
dude that is not enough to increase my
squat either
that just maintains my squat so try to
get them to do four and five and six and
eventually more sets per week of
squatting and a lot of times like holy
crap my squat's going up like crazy
a lot of times high frequency programs
work because they just smash more volume
in
and all of a sudden just doing more is
going to get you more and that's a
really good start now that doesn't mean
more is always better
you should know what your maximum
recoverable volume is so that you don't
exceed that and a lot of times people
are doing way too much and then they're
struggling
so make sure you're doing not too little
and not too much once you're in that
general range
how you move through it's not super
relevant but just being in that zone of
you know the training is effective is a
really good start because all these
other tips don't make
any difference if you're not training
enough or if you're training too much
number three fatigue management needs to
just be at least decent that means
your sleep is decent like if you're
getting five hours or four hours of
sleep at night you're always like barely
awake
i don't care what the rest of your
program looks like i predict that you
won't make gains
stress management if you're currently in
a breakup cycle with your girlfriend and
she stabs you in the pec every now and
again
you're gonna have trouble benching right
so if you're always in the chaos chronic
state a lot of people like meh man
my lifts kind of suck and i'm like
what's going on they're like residency
and uh finished med school and now i'm
like in surgery rotations i sleep five
hours a night and just my preceptor
yells at me every hour like
yeah if that sleep even gets fixed the
stress is so high
it's maybe time for you to just maintain
until that rotation is over right so
basically what we mean by that is like
if your stress is excessive
there's a lot of other factors that just
can't be addressed at that point right
physical stress emotional stress some
people like you know um
i work a super physical job what can i
do to maximize powerlifting training
there's some trade-offs there that have
to happen so that's something to look at
to make sure you're at least not
confused as to why you're not making
progress and look
if you work outdoor job that's really
physical and your boss is like hey i've
got like more
clerical shit for you to do if you want
then if you're really serious about
strength training you're like yes i
would love to sit in an air conditioned
office
at least three days a week you start
doing that you put your heavy workouts
at the end of those days and holy shit
my lips are going up because that
physical stress
is now significantly reduced right
number four making sure that your chosen
exercises have great stimulus to fatigue
ratios
and are regularly increasing in load
with minimum discomfort like if you're
benching and like shoulder feels kind of
weird you never feel connected to the
movement
and you're not really able to like add
load over time like something's always
feeling off
gee whiz you know how do you know that
your programming is going to be
supporting good gains what you want is
to really get locked in like every time
you squat you're like man
i just feel the groove on this if you
feel the groove amazing keep that groove
keep that technique
use that exercise and maybe it's high
bar squats for you maybe it's low bar
maybe front squats are the ticket
whatever you feel a groove with slowly
increased load at a time and you've
almost
auto solved your pr problem it's just
you couldn't get any traction before
right
if you're trying to bench when you hurt
your shoulder or it feels off and you're
playing with your grip every other week
of course you're not going to be able to
increase your bench you've got to have
some solid ground
and find a good technique that has a
high stimulus lower fatigue that you can
consistently improve upon
number five technique-wise for a lift
has to be stable and working
for you that lets you lift your biggest
number so some people will say
you know my sumo deadlift i figured it
out it's just skyrocketing right
but my conventional deadlift i like
can't figure out and every time i try to
widen my sumo stance it all goes to hell
my first question to them is like are
you allowed to do a mid-stance sumo in
competition like yeah
is it your best lift like yeah is it the
one that increases the fast it's like
yeah
what the hell are you doing try to
increase your conventional and your
super stance sumo
why and they're like well i guess maybe
it'll carry over like well it's just not
carrying over is it
no i hate it it sucks and i'm always
trying to change my technique and it's
different all the time i know what good
technique is but i'm always trying to go
wider a little narrower stop doing that
a lot of people have this paranoia that
they're missing out on stuff
let that paranoia soak in once you're
not making gains
if you know you have a track like you're
this grip a bench just
feels fucking great and it just you're
connected and your technique is awesome
and you can make little gains
just do that sure after that main bench
workout
you can do some other stuff to try to
see if you can wiggle in a groove
maybe another session or something but
don't abandon your core good technique
for technique that you're sort of a lot
of people change their technique too
often they're pie in the sky like well
if i could only dead lift like this
crazy russian dude
i'll be the best deadlift like you with
what works
slowly play with some other stuff but
never replace it outright don't have
this
crazy technique thing where you're going
one technique to another
number six this is a big one being in a
hypercaloric gain
phase when you're at you're in your
hypertrophy phases and adding net body
weight over the months and years
to get the strongest you have to get the
most muscular like i've talked to a lot
of folks that have just sort of maxed
out their frames
for how much muscle they're carrying
relative to like
you know or so for how much muscle they
have they're not as strong as they're
gonna get
but like they could just add more muscle
and get way stronger especially some
taller guys that are in the lower weight
classes like yeah my bench is having
trouble going up i'm like
motherfucker i'm surprised you bench
what you bench i'm really impressed with
them skinny ass spaghetti arms
and they're like oh yeah i guess like if
i gained weight like yeah i guess
so if you really want to be big and
strong and strong
get big okay so eat you know
lifting is for tiny people too but if
you're tiny and you want to get much
stronger getting bigger is a part of
that equation many times for advanced
lifters really small short lifters maybe
that's not in the cards but for many
people
the mystery of why you can't deadlift
600 is solved by the fact that you weigh
180 and if you wait 220 you would be
able to pull 600.
so do you want to be big and strong
sweet get big and the strength will come
almost every single time number seven
second to last point
training side fatigue management has to
be there a lot of people do
the hard training well and they do it
right but they're skimping on their
d-loads or they don't really take them
active rest they don't really take so
they're chronically more and more beat
up every year
they don't take lower volume phases when
they really need their body to relax
they don't properly peak you have to
make sure your training side fatigue
management is
in place sometimes when i talk to people
about what's struggling and they're like
i'm sleeping well i'm eating well i'm
training hard i'm like how often do you
deload they're like
um i don't really like delo deload and
all of a sudden that's a stopped
conversation and i
get in there and go what do you mean you
don't deal a deal well
i feel good and then like when i feel
tired i'll take one or two light
sessions and just get back into it stop
doing that deload
a lot of times they start delivering
like oh my god there's like a breath of
life in my training i'm hitting all
these crazy pr's
because my fatigue i would only ever
bring it down a little bit and then it
would just go right back up
de-loading for the first time in years
brought my fatigue to here
so that i got all this training high
quality to put in until my fatigue was
super high again
right it's like someone who's like
trying to eat a really big meal to
impress someone
but they eat a pretty big meal every
three hours right and they're like i
always feel like
when i start eating a meal i'm still
kind of full from the last one like go
check this out if you want to eat a real
big meal like if you're going to buffet
or like maximize value
don't eat for six hours before you go
and like really like yeah let that meal
come down through your gi tract
just like letting the fatigue come down
so you really start fresh
and build up like crazy now last one
isn't a rule by itself it modifies all
of these other rules
it is the following and it's super super
super important
if you figure out that one or two of
these things is something you can
improve on and we can always probably
all of us improve to some extent on
these whatever improvements you make
make them and keep them for long enough
which means
months it doesn't mean days and it
doesn't mean weeks
people will say okay i really need to
get a good technique for my lift and
stick to have gotten it
they do it for two weeks and they test
their max and nothing happens
how fucking strong can you get in two
weeks not much especially if you're
immediate advanced
get that good technique down for months
two strength phases in a row
you hit a 15 pound pr slow clap
a lot of folks who are into
troubleshooting and really worried about
like oh i got to get better and they
start troubleshooting
that same anxiety is what leads them
to be really restless and not apply
these things long enough and be like oh
okay i tried being in a hyper caloric
phase for two weeks but that didn't work
i didn't get stronger so it's back to
square one and they stopped doing that
so you're gonna gain muscle
shit it's gonna take a while if you're
gonna plug into an exercise that has a
really good sfr it's going to take a
while to discover what that is it's
going to take a while
to actually yield some training benefits
right
if you're applying fatigue management
strategies if you're trying to get more
sleep
two weeks of good sleep is fine you need
months of consistent good sleep in order
to see results
so don't just write these things off as
oh that didn't work if you apply them
for a little while
do due diligence apply them for months
and months and months and you
will absolutely get better in almost
every case
folks thanks for tuning in i hope you
enjoyed this series see you next time
for another crazy series just like this
