slow chest up chest up chest up up none
of that elbows on the knee shit down one
last one low
[Music]
slow all right folks Dr Mike here for
Renaissance
periodization this is Dr Crystal gavara
she is a board certified sports medicine
doctor among other things and works for
Team USA figure skating twice Year yes
on International trips where you're the
team doctor to make sure when they um
Jenga block themselves all over the ice
she comes and she does the click and the
they are all fine afterwards yeah
something like that that's medicine yes
yes in any case Dr crystal is going to
be doing a dumbbell only leg workout we
got glutes we got quads we got H
hypertrophy work going to show you guys
how to do minimum equipment training and
make it brutal you good to go yeah okay
cool let's get started all right so
we're doing this little workout she's
out take uh using the bathroom or some
shit right now with this workout you
guys will learn how to do the dumbbell
shit whatever exercise is great but also
you go your boy's going to put you up on
some game because I'm G spit that shit
because that damn bitch got like eight
curves for every curve you're supposed
to have Bo in I don't know where her
situation is at home with her man or
whatever we out here baby watch this
it's going to be subtle and it's
not all right first exercise with a
dumbbell stiff a deadlift good enough
for Great Grandma good enough for
Grandma good enough for Mom good enough
for me we're going to warm up with the
20s here crystal is going to show you
what good technique looks like hi how
you feeling you're feeling good pretty
good 20 in each hand is okay for a warm
up okay nice and easy go ahead and grab
them oh we so weak so remember the cues
are tilt the hips back to reach the butt
very far back keep your knees back and
your chest majorly up the whole time
until you get a deep painful
stretch yes and come up excellent I love
that hole down there for a second big
tummy big chest
but back keep those knees back they're
going to want to come see how they're
shaking that's perfect and then up a lot
of people what they would do in this
situation is they would use tactile cues
of like kind of where to push your butt
back I would be touching your knees but
let me tell you something you ready for
this yeah I got two things going for
me three okay one an irrational hatred
of tactile cues that I think I inherited
from Jared other ifb Pro two
is restraint nobility civility not
touching a young woman who hasn't
consented to it that's your business not
mine and third I don't like to brag
about the shit but they I just straight
up say I don't give a fuck you're
looking really good right that your boy
comes from
so the opposite of
scarcity you don't phase me at
all hundreds thousands have come and
been rejected what do you think you got
for me that they don't giggle giggle
giggle the fuck up out of
here warm-ups are done that was 20 lbs
for the warm-up set of six now we're
going to be doing sets of 5 to 10 with
45 lbs really challenging the hamstrings
get that knees back hips back chest up
really super stretch the hands you
feeling good about it Dr Crystal okay
very good what do you think is a good
idea do you want to use some chalk do
you want to use straps uh usually I use
straps do you really
yeah that's not a good idea oh why is
that well you see the moment arm of the
forearm in any case vers Crips no you
got your own or you want to borrow mine
I have my own you might not pass any
drug tests after you get my shit on you
you feel me oh boy oh
[Music]
boy
good couple more
Arch hams only butt back big
chest up and one more last one big arch
big tummy yes there you go chest up
knees back knees back up yeah rack right
on the bench good stuff butt back big
chest yes
and
down one more big chest big tummy hit it
you got this let's go nice and easy very
good setup big chest big chest big chest
up yes rack good job I think it's too
heavy for what
life I need you to understand something
this is going to sounds
strange this to the untrained D me seem
like a lifting
session where we do a few reps and grow
some muscle but I want everyone watching
to know and especially you Dr
Crystal this what is happening here is a
homerian epic
tragedy valiance failer regret one
chance to make it all go well that's the
pressure we're talking about with
lifting am I sufficiently Asian yet good
good Asian folks remember that there's
not an amount of pressure you can't put
on yourself which is too much everything
is doe or die including totally mundane
tasks which for which you successfully
completed the repetitions requested with
perfect technique I might add and then
that's too heavy which means what
exactly don't bother answering just sit
there and look fucking gorgeous give me
that weight get your hand off my fucking
weight God damn
it the
[Music]
fuck no weight first just pretend you
have weight okay and I want to get your
foot up on that would you call that 3 in
sure much do you know about 3 inches
well this is six maybe so half did you
say sex six oh my clavicle I was off by
one letter don't uh don't get at me okay
you guys will notice she's in a deficit
here major deficit 3in that really puts
the glute at a huge stretch at the
bottom and really really targets the
living shit out of the glute for that
reason we do both feet because the front
leg is the one getting glute targeted of
course tons of quad Focus also tons of
adductor as well this is a I want to
call it a whole leg exercise but it
really check some boxes warmups feel
good yeah take a little break we'll use
the 20s for work sets and the way I have
it is we have four work sets Okay but we
uh take each one of them as just one leg
so it's really like one set rest switch
legs another set rest switch legs just
four total cool okay very
good
excellent up up up good one more slow
control gentle pause
speed luck oh yeah rack that's 10 right
yeah good stuff rack we're going to be
doing the other leg so take plenty of
time to rest very good that's a booty
Blaster yeah hell yeah that's what's up
that's what he
said game tip number two women yeah if
you're handsome like me they're in
whatever if you're rich oh they're in
but you got to layer that shit in and
wherever you are in life you can always
do the one number one thing I always
recommend to get women and that's lie I
don't mean lie like tell people you were
an astronaut well that's actually not a
bad idea a few inches later I sealed the
door between the space shuttle and the
soou capsule just something like just
space pulling out vacuum as soon as I
hear the cling I knew I saved the whole
crew and honestly like it's the thanks
by the children and the spouses of the
crews back on Earth that had me feeling
a certain way when I was saving those
astronauts in space I was just doing my
job anyone would have done that but it
was was the children that were like Dr
Mike thank you so much for saving these
astronauts you're so selfless and also
incredibly brave but also hyper
competent how do you know how the so's
capsule work do do you know what I
mean ah
success she's
[Music]
impressed
slow up oh 10 good job rack very good
very goodoo rack and rest have a seat
good
stuff good stuff
good stuff very good people say this is
the wrong advice on a date technically I
consider any hang out with a woman a
date but I think it's spoton what you
need to do is do two things you need to
demonstrate the concept of pre-selection
that means other women have selected you
before to be mating material and you got
to let these current bitches know that
you're not willing these motherfuckers
that's getting the shaft you're in and
two is a jealousy plot line and the the
fucking hierarchy stack you got to
understand you know let these current
bitches know that they ain't shit cuz
you had better before so absolutely talk
about x's and past hookups watch this so
her name was anuka she was Swedish right
X longtime ex of mine and she was
legitimately 6 foot1 and a runway
model but like honestly dude do you know
why we couldn't be
together cuz she was like Dr Mike she
always called me Dr Mike um she was like
I want want I wanted a relationship with
you that was
holistic that was like emotional and and
generational and romantic and sexual and
she's like your sexual Vibes just the
sheer physical fucking loving you put
down on me is so much I can't possibly
measure up in any capacity I have to go
and live my normal life I can't live at
your Superhero Speed anymore does that
make sense you ever had something like
that happen to you oh you're here oh
[Music]
hey eight rest a
sec
begin up N9 and one more slow
control up go go rack good job rest it
out
[Music]
way to go
slow nine Gentle
Touch 10 beautiful rack how'd that
feel challenging cool do you want to go
on a
DAT no okay I'm going to put these
dumbbells away and we'll get to the next
exercise all right sounds
good I only ever touch women
because of bullshit make belief
Kinesiology reasons but then I'm in
watch this something I notice about
lifters of your kind of build is that
like your ILO soas tend to be really
tight and that actually has like a
downstream effect to leading to like
improper glute activation does that make
sense yeah but you're like touching my
trap yeah yeah well it's all
connected you know what I mean
right she
knows four sets of lunges done two sets
of stiff legged deadlift and now we're
on to our last exercise which is two
sets of May rep bottom 2/3 partial
squats body weight
what oh my God I can't like believe he's
got me like ah
training don't fucking start with me in
any case let me talk you through it
heels on toes off feet pointed out
on girls you want to intimidate them
with enormous quads so although I don't
know if that's working we're going to
have Dr Crystal break at the hips slowly
sink down hold at the bottom for two
whole seconds and then come up only two
thirs of the way and then slowly under
control sink down again hold for two
seconds repeat that as many times as she
can until she's really struggling then
we let her stand all the way up she's
going to wobble but the lockout needs
the quad's rest shake it out a little
bit and then hit it again probably going
to do about three meup mini sets per set
two sets it's a lot of approaches to
failure a lot of metabolite
sequestration a lot of that one thing
that women love what's that shit called
pain especially delivered by a
domineering man hey hey hey you ever uh
you like 50 Shades of Gray no I haven't
read the book or watched you don't read
much yeah I don't you like cartoons and
