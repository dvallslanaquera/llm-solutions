have you ever heard of like hit training
Mike mener high-intensity training hit
Mike mener and those folks were fans of
going to failure and Beyond with drop
sets and crazy like that they got
really good results but they don't do
very many sets a few sets per muscle per
workout it's all they do because they
realize we can't recover from this you
can recover from more if you stay a
little shy of failure my suspicion is
that if you want the best overall muscle
growth and you have all the time in the
world to train that somewhere between
three and one rep in reserve on average
for a program is a really good idea but
you also want to test your every
now and again it's difficult to say this
say two reps in reserve if it's been
months since you've actually gone to
failure on that ex cuz you can be
 lying to yourself yeah it's two
R someone puts a gun to your head
literally maybe and they're like go to
failure and you get six more reps well
 it turns out you weren't even in
that best growth zone of 3 to one
