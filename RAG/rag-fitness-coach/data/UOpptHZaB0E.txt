hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
muscle gain dieting made simple video
number seven dealing with
difficulties i thought muscle gain was
supposed to be super easy
well it can get tough but we know a lot
of the ways in which it gets tough and
we can actually preempt them so
last time in video number six we figured
out how to generate a caloric surplus of
our choice and we figure out how long to
diet for
a muscle gain diet in order to make
productive gains in muscle
granted that we're training hard and
consistently however diets don't
always go to plan and a few things can
actually bubble up and three of them
predictably will in many cases
the first is trouble fitting into your
macros or choosing foods
another one is getting too full and not
being able to eat as much as you
actually have to
and number three is body fat gain
gets a little bit out of hand and
there's probably something we can do
about all three of those so
first up is macro fitting dieting for
muscle gain can be pretty tough
and another layer of tough can be in
trying to figure out what foods you have
to eat every day
to meet the macros that you told
yourself per meal or per day that you're
gonna hit
this is especially difficult to do on
the fly because sometimes you might be
at home you might have your home cooked
food you might sort of know what you're
going to eat but when you're out in the
real world
busy at a work conference or traveling
or something like that then all of a
sudden you're like oh my god i have no
idea what to eat
i normally have my meal plan i don't
know what to do and this
especially is a problem folks they're
not big eaters and not consistent eaters
okay if you just a person likes food
you're not gonna have any problems
massing
all you need to do is eat more of the
good stuff less of the bad stuff train
hard and voila mass is yours
however the vast majority of people are
either sort of neutral to food or
some combination of when they're massing
not inclined to eat as much
and a lot of them don't have big
appetites they start to skip meals they
start to just
choose the wrong choices because they're
super full and then all of a sudden they
don't gain the weight that they want
right now you can use an app to make
this easier
oh shameless plug the rp diet app lets
you plug in all the foods and it does
all the math for you so it
it says here are your macros you have to
hit and you scan in a bunch of foods and
it auto aligns them to get you what you
want
that's totally fine takes a little bit
of bandwidth to do you can do it it's
super helpful but there are ways to do
it
without the rp diet app and even if you
use the rp diet app
you can do all of these things better
with a couple of really good tips and
here they are
how to make sure you hit your macros
consistently first
is in most cases make a list of two to
four
veggies two to four grains and fruits
two to four basic fats two to four basic
proteins
like chicken and steak and egg whites
and whey protein powder
or for veggies like broccoli and
cauliflower and lettuce and so on and so
forth
and you combine these into really tasty
meals
that you want to eat that are also super
healthy and support your goals because
you have these super basic food items
you go to the store
you buy them you cook them and here's
the next recommendation you cook them in
bulk
you spread them out into meals so you
have chicken and rice and chicken and
rice and chicken and rice and broccoli
you have ground beef and pasta gravy
from pasta gravy pasta you make a bunch
of meals
all of these meals are fitted into your
day the thing is when they're already
cooked and they're already refrigerated
or frozen
then all you do is pull them out pop
them in the microwave reheat them
put them back out eat them and you're
good to go you don't have to do
calculations on the spot because you did
all your calculations up front
there's no oh man i'm really hungry or
oh damn it i have to eat
but i don't have a meal around all that
is solved right
if really time is super expensive to you
and you have a pretty decent amount of
money
a company like trifecta or ripping that
dish right here
can help trifecta sends me a ton of food
every week
and it sends me rice and chicken and all
that stuff
and i just throw the microwave i sort of
mix it together throw the microwave you
guys have seen my chef
video hopefully and it saves me a ton of
time
so i can be busy doing all of my rp work
making more videos for you guys etc etc
and it's totally cool because all the
cooking has been done for me now you
don't need to do that you can just go to
the store and get all the food yourself
bulk meal prep is king i'll tell you
this almost every successful bodybuilder
that's really really jacked
does bulk meal prep or has a company
meal prep for him
or her because it's such a huge deal to
have your entire plan
out in front of you okay now sometimes
you're on the run you can't bring your
meals
i would highly recommend having
on-the-run go-to sources
for calories and protein for example
protein bars or shakes or wraps or
burritos
say oh i have to go to the mailbox and
drop off this package and i have to talk
to this one guy who's at another office
uh i know there's a chipotle in that
area i'm going to stop by it right
around 3pm which is my next meal
pick up a burrito i know exactly what
order i'm going to go
if you go to an area like that for work
you just have absolutely no idea what
the hell's over there
absolutely no idea what you're going to
eat you are planning
to fail because you're planning to go
somewhere which doesn't have anything
it's like going you're like oh we're
gonna go on a hike we're not gonna bring
water
and hopefully there's gonna be water on
the hike and you go on a hike like
outside of las vegas somewhere where
it's a fucking desert
i know somebody could call you pretty
stupid for doing that because there's
almost certainly not gonna be water or
you just have no idea
and bringing it yourself is a good idea
so if mass gaining is really serious to
you planning is a really really good
thing
fortune favors the prepared in
everything and
muscle gain is absolutely no exception
now
as you gain more and more weight
predictably
in almost every case you will get
somewhat less hungry
for some people the somewhat less hungry
never butts up against anything they're
doing they're always able to meet their
calories and macros they get big
no problem but for many people you will
get they will get so
much less hunger that actually start to
have trouble
meeting their macros and they can't eat
enough food to hit their calorie goals
to actually successfully gain weight
right the body prefers homeostasis like
right now i'm like 245 pounds i'm trying
to get to like 250 at the end of my
muscle gain phase
that's tough okay my body doesn't want
to be 250.
it actually wants me to be at like 235
like if i just started eating like
whatever i wanted it would go down to
235 between 230 and 235
250 my body doesn't want to do wherever
you are if you've been gaining mass for
a long time you're starting to not be
hungry your body's like go get lower it
doesn't want you to gain weight but
remember you want to gain weight
logically up here
right so you'll have to do something
about that hunger because if you just
follow your hunger
you in many cases just will not get
jacked almost every jack person on this
earth not everyone some people have
really big appetites but almost everyone
has modulated their hunger somehow
pushed beyond their hunger somehow to
eat more food than their body really
wanted
right so a lot of people will not
take these precautions they'll start to
under eat
and for weeks of amazing training
they'll eat at maintenance or even a
slight deficit
because they went like this and then
they go like that and then that entire
time
maybe six weeks of maintenance slight
deficit you're gaining profoundly
less muscle than you were in a muscle
gain phase so you tell people like
someone's like hey how long have you
mass gaining for me like
fuck 12 weeks bruh but six of those
weeks you were not gaining mass
you might have been gaining a little bit
of muscle losing a little bit of fat but
as we know recomposition
just not a very efficient process you
have to stay on top and
make sure to hit your meals how do you
do that
three good tips for you guys tip number
one is eat more calorically dense foods
okay
so for example instead of eating all
chicken breast
you can switch to some or all chicken
thigh okay
you can put more oils into your carbs a
little bit olive oil goes a long way as
long as you're
rooming your fats you're totally good to
go eating white rice versus brown
you can pound a crap load of white rice
brown rice gee you pound enough of it
and
it comes out the same way it went in
well i guess
unadultered right still the whole you
know just digestion can only do so much
fiber
right you can do less filling veggies
smaller veggie amounts so on and so
forth so more calorically dense foods
are really great idea
very closely tied into that is eating
more
tasty foods as you get less and less
hungry
because tasty foods are easier to eat
more of at any given level of hunger
right if someone's like hey like how
hungry are you and you're like i don't
know not really
someone gives you as much chicken breast
and plain brown rice as you can eat how
much you can eat
remember said you're not really hungry
you might like pick at it for a bit and
be like
i don't know am i getting paid for this
like no no just eat whatever you want
you're like
nothing or two bites and it's not that
good i'm done now if you're not really
that hungry and someone puts a bunch of
pizza in front of you super hot fresh
brooklyn style whatever style you like
chicago
and they're like eat as much as you like
you're like oh for real free like that
free no no strings attached
you may need a slice or two even if
you're not that hungry that slice or two
is like fucking 700
calories right there you might have had
20 if you like tried a bit of chicken
you're like fuck that i'm not even
hungry so
more tasty foods is a really good idea
and
does that mean you have to eat pizza
doesn't mean you have to eat junk food
absolutely not
you can but in order to keep your macros
and your health up a little bit what you
can do is do
flavors and spices and salts and make
your rice and turkey taste really good
when you take
classic you know white rice and ground
turkey
maybe with a bit of broccoli slaw you
mix them together and it's like it's
fine it's fine you put some salt in that
because remember salt is perfectly
healthy in in most amounts especially if
you're an athlete
and you put some kind of seasoning in
there and all of a sudden
it's actually really really good and
normally you would struggle to eat a
certain amount of it now you're
finishing it and be like oh this is
great
okay that helps bodybuilding doesn't
mean
suffering it means suffering for the
shit you have to suffer for
but it doesn't mean suffering for the
shit you don't okay so there's tons of
like you know universal nutrition animal
ads
where the guys like eating oatmeal and
milk or some shit and protein powder and
he's like
i fucking eat oatmeal and i poured jug
of water down my face and fucking gulp
and chew and repeat is fucking what it
takes like a word up
uh and sometimes that's just has to be
what it is but
instead of eating fucking unflavored
oatmeal maybe you could eat flavored
white rice
just the same macros same calories and
all of a sudden you can pound it down no
problem right
really really good idea last point
huge point one of the death knells of
weight gain for people that
are sort of hard gainers in some respect
people with not big appetites
is skipping meals do not fucking skip
meals
eating something at least something
maybe you don't hit your macros that
week exactly maybe you hit your calories
but you still hit something you still
gain weight or at the very least
you're at maintenance you're not losing
weight okay so some people will do this
thing where they eat a lot one week
a couple days they don't eat much eat a
lot couple days and then over the course
of a 16-week diet it's it's
it's maintenance actually started 150
they ended at like 151.
whoo huge gonna be enormous like never
but if you plan to go
from 150 to oh i don't know 160
and you have some off times but you
managed to get something in maybe you'll
uh end up at 157 hey shit 157 versus 151
that's amazing results what is it you
can stuff down your
throat if you're odd i could go all
sorts of places with that joke
what do you eat if you really don't feel
like eating or if you're on the go so on
and so forth
liquid meals are a real good thing even
mass gaining shakes are a real good idea
here
i actually just started taking my
favorite mass gainer which is serious
mass about optimum nutrition
i don't get paid by them they don't know
i exist amazing if you want to try it
i have like two scoops before training
and then i come home and sort of
two scoops before training i drive to
the gym and then i do
two scoops during slash after my workout
come home shower
and then have my first actual whole food
meal and that
entire four scoops or sorry it's one
heaping scoop
now two scoops i don't wanna say two
scoops it's really four because the
scooper is like fucking enormous so it's
really just two protein shake containers
full of stuff that's actually pretty
delicious
is 50 grams of protein 250 grams of
carbs
fuck and like four grams of fat
unbelievable
okay and it's so fucking easy and
otherwise i would just be looking at a
protein shake and be like uh
or i'd be looking at my real food but i
get it in any way and it all adds up
right so peanut butter sandwiches with a
whey protein shake
protein bars even if you can't eat your
whole meal eat some of it even if you
don't have a meal around eat something
with protein in it and carbs and fats
for the love of god if you have trouble
gaining weight you haven't tried this
the blame is all on you right especially
good idea to use liquid meals
and other really quick food strategies
when you know your hunger is low like
i'm not a morning eater i wake up in the
morning the food is the last thing i'm
thinking about
probably more sleep is the first thing
i'm thinking about or just jewish
anxiety about the upcoming day
oh no will it be scary so what do i do
i usually have a shake i almost never
eat solid food in the morning not that
there's anything magical to that i'm
just a little bitch and i can't have
solid food in the morning because i'll
just eat a bite fuck i'm done
right so if you know you're not going to
be hungry liquid meals are a really
really really good idea
all right last problem body fat gain big
problem
right in almost every case during muscle
gain some fat will come around and
that's totally fine
good news the really good news is that
fat is actually quite easy to lose
unless you have a ton of it so you gain
some fat in the mass gain phase the
muscle gain phase you actually can lose
all that fat relatively easily
it's temporary cost of the game so don't
worry about it too much
but if it really kind of bothers you or
if you're gaining way too much fat here
are some tips
for you to stay on the leaner side of
things first is aim for the lower
pace of weekly weight gain so gain point
two five percent of your body weight per
week not point five and for sure nothing
higher
a lot of people are like i can get bad
on my mass phase i'm like how much
weight are you getting like booked two
pounds a week
and back in the day was actually still
videos on youtube of this
with me saying like you should gain one
to two pounds per week you know it's
probably not wrong wrong but not the
rightest thing i've ever said
right and so 0.25 stay in that range and
jeez you know if you gain a lot of fat
doing that
you know it's just it's tough you're
really either very advanced or doing
something wrong or have really shitty
genetics and maybe all three
right second point aim for the lower end
of the duration look look if you get
super fat on your masking phases that
last 16 weeks don't fucking mask for 16
weeks
0.25 a week for 8 to 12 weeks and you
may not just get that fat
you may gain 5 pounds total not really
much fatter but hey you got stronger you
got bigger things are good
do a mini cut get rid of all the fat and
start again right next is eat mostly
healthy foods
that actually suppress your appetite
considerably so this would basically do
the opposite of what we did in the last
slide
because some people say dude bro like
when i'm dieting i'm fucking locked in
when i'm massing i fucking want to eat
everything
because i know i can and sort of like
talk myself into it i can't keep a
cap on it keep a fucking gap on it right
it's not that difficult to get in the
mindset of like i'm a fucking
bodybuilder or i want to get jacked
i gotta eat x y and z foods to get me
jacked i don't just eat fucking cookies
because
mass gaining is easy you just eat a
shitload of junk food people on my 600
pound life tv show do it all the fucking
time
bodybuilding is tougher because you have
to eat at least some modicum of healthy
food
so if your problem is you tend to
overeat in a mass phase shit i've been
there
uh mostly healthy food and then you're
gonna eat overeat
brown rice chicken and broccoli holy
fuck need some kind of congressional
medal of honor for that shit so
if you eat mostly healthy foods and
don't cheat your brains off maybe just
have one or two cheat meals a week not
three or four or five
then you probably will be leaner at the
end of the process
next point train hard and train with
higher volumes right
relative to your abilities of course so
don't arbitrarily do 10 by 10 stupid
german volume training and fucking blow
your legs off your body
but do plenty of work like if you seem
to be recovering and growth seems to be
really good
and it seems like you're recovering so
much that you could add more work and
still recover fucking add more work
it's muscle gain time all that is for a
good end and a lot of people say like oh
man like
i'm fucking getting kind of fat on this
mass phase i'm like what's your training
frequency
what's your volume and so on and so
forth they're like yeah i trade for like
an hour a day
three days a week what the fuck start
training for work your way up slowly
take my own advice to training six days
a week very slowly several months
from three to six and go to one and a
half hours
per day of hard good muscle building
work and all of a sudden you'll find
that
more of the weight you gain is muscle
and less is fat right
and if you're already training with very
hard with high volumes this is clearly
not like a cork you can uncap like you
already
already released that genie and that's
fine we definitely don't want you to go
more than you're capable of doing
but if you're much less than you're
capable of doing and you're really
worried about fat game
right then it's kind of like what the
hell are you doing it's like if you uh
you know if you have like a really
dilapidated porch in the front of your
house and you're like fucking goddamn
porch i'm gonna fall through these
fucking
you know this wood floor here and kill
myself and someone's like how much work
have you spent
time have you spent working on the
portrait like i never fucking touch it
you're like
what the fuck are you complaining do you
have time in the day yes well if i can
work at it or hire someone like
that's a good point right so same kind
of idea if you're training not so much
and you can train much harder but you're
bitching about fat gain that's right
bitch bitch away nobody's listening
do more training and it'll get much
better another big one is
stay physically active outside the gym
some people when they're on a muscle
gain phase
they just stop almost all activity it's
like fuck getting big bro fuck
cardio and like they sit on the tv or
sit you know
super hard training get home do all
their work or they go to work do all the
work come home
sit like with the remote control and
they fuck i need more food hey honey can
you get me more food
they realize their kids to get them
stuff look you're not auditioning for my
600 pound life
if you just do normal daily physical
tasks walk your dog walk around the
block wave hi to your neighbors get up
and down watch
you know from watching tv if someone
calls you you plug in your headphones
walk around the apartment walk around
the house
what that ends up happening is if you're
more active is all of a sudden you
actually get to eat more food which is
ta if you know if you have trouble with
fat gain sometimes it's your appetite
but so you get to eat more food or the
same amount of food and you just don't
get as fat
and a good deal of physical activity up
until it makes you really tired
probably potentiates muscle gain by
keeping you more insulin sensitive more
healthy
if you're leaner and healthier you don't
get crazy back pumps when you squat
anymore when you do bent rows you're
actually better at training
huge huge benefits huge benefits so if
you
have trouble gaining weight you probably
don't have a ton of trouble with fat
gain
and if you so it's kind of a
self-solving problem if you really have
trouble gaining weight but you don't
have problem fat gain do less physical
activity
if you have no trouble gaining weight
but you're getting a little fat do more
physical activity lastly
this is kind of the first point it's
temporary
the fat is temporary it's easy to get
rid of later
it doesn't take that much time it's just
the cost of doing business
if you cannot stomach an ounce of gained
fat
it's probably not the sport for you and
it's probably not the hobby for you
because if you really want great results
you got to get a little bit fatter on
occasion for a temporary amount of time
all right so hopefully these tips here
have uh are really going to help you
succeed with your muscle gain phase
and that's sweet a lot of people have
gained muscle but far fewer people have
kept it off
or have settled to gain even more muscle
later like a lot of guys will start
training they weigh
140 after a few years they'll be 160 and
that's as far as they go
how do you make sure you continue to
gain muscle over the years and months
to actually reach close to what would
someone would term genetic potential
next time we'll talk about that and i'll
see you then
you
