[Music]
hey folks it's me Dr Mike for YouTube
for right outside spiritualization and
an interesting tangent that I promise
I'll leave back in there is a Japanese
heavy lift construction machine company
called Komatsu
and we got a little bit of our own
flavor at that shit because Amanda
kohatsu
has a bit of Japanese in her yes 50 50
that means she's 50 Industrial grade
lifting machine
clearly well on your way now this
workout is gonna do so much straight
damage to the gym we were not allowed to
legally do it without an officially
licensed fellowed sports medicine doctor
and she had to be so close she had to
actually do the workout this is Dr
Crystal and
um no relation but I got one I got my
eye on one of these girls I don't flirt
ever ever professionally on set I may
make an exception today
in any case it's lovely meeting you
ladies
but uh we're gonna do a little back
workout
a little ifbb Pro and a little ifbb bro
and uh there's gonna be tons of giggling
tons of rumor mill bullshit and tons of
me trying to train these young ladies to
have bigger backs and uh well shit girls
but damn
damn all right watch for the technique
watch for the effort
watch for Amanda's traps they're not
that hard to find and watch for Dr
guevara's straight animal intensity
let's get into it
[Music]
all right first exercise is the Atlantis
chest supported row it's a great machine
there's a trillion different ways to use
it we'll be using one of them the ladies
are probably going to be doing some wide
grip growing
full big deep stretch Arch all the way
at the top and a full slowly Center
control sets of 10 to 20 here I want to
start with this movement because the
rest of the workout is going to be much
more vertical pull and lat focused so
this is going to hit a lot of traps
middle traps rhomboids rear delts all
that stuff even that with width up there
and let me give you that meet with the
last I mean you go into the world and
people say hello to you for the first
time because you have a big back and

a couple things you want to keep in mind
one is you want to lean over here at
this top part so that your lats are
stretched a ton you don't want to stop
here you want to reach overhead
up there
[Laughter]
somewhere I can't do that neither can
you okay as you come down I want you to
come down and hip in just a little bit a
tiny little bit

you guys did amazing you showed up you
did great technique you ground
yourselves into a giant palpable
flesh and backs there's a lot of back Dr
Crystal what did you think I was that
was a lot of work that's all I had to
say great amazing Insight from a doctor
what do you think
I think I am more pumped than I have
probably ever been
um
I never thought I would cry doing
assisted pull-ups and lat prayers
but I shed a little tear today
doing what most people would like in the
Palestine world would call like
accessories but I think that's been a
big lesson for me shifting from policy
today
is there is no accessory all the
movements are the core movements folks
follow these ladies on social media you
got plenty of good stuff from Crystal
medical shit yeah if you Pro man she's
been around for forever even though
she's only 22 years old somehow she's
been an alpha generation
tons of good stuff and I mean physique
is like when she turned Pro she turned
Pro in like six different divisions at
the same time bitch had their Pro card
out Amanda had her shit and she's like
I'm gonna have that too bitch Imma have
that and hey hey come here what was your
