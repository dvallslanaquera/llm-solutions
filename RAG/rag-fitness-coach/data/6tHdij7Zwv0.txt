hey folks we're back with a brand
spanking new
thumbnail and a new title it's the
bi-weekly q a now my god
the humanity god it's good to be back
we're here to answer
questions with i like the sexy new
thumbnail i'm so stoked on that scott is
the man
isn't it though it's amazing yes
i love it dr mike how's it going
everything good with you it's good i
actually wanted to answer a really quick
question someone had that we won't be
able to really get to
someone asked how do we get um
can can they have the music that's in
these various training videos
and the answer to that is no
because the music is either written by
scott
our video guy because he's an audio
engineer and a musician he's
he's amazing or so it's either
custom written
or sourced from a pay-per-play library
that musicians use
in video production to get various
soundtracks going so
you can't actually have this publicly
because you have to pay for it uh and he
does
but it gives you like he's got this
access to these libraries that have like
unreal number of tracks
and they're usually not like vocal
tracks they're like mood tracks and
there's different 50 different moods
so it's uh that's where he gets it from
uh sorry
i know that's a shitty answer because
sometimes i love the music i hear in
some videos and i'm like i want that
actual song and it turns out it's not a
song
so yeah yes for if you guys are familiar
with stock images it's the same idea
just with music
yep all right well we got some questions
i do think i did notice that uh in
milo's um
tagging last times i couldn't help but
laugh
there was the part where he just labeled
it as interesting
tangents that's awesome talking about
porn that's great people love it there's
comments like that was the greatest
tangent ever
folks we're only good for a few things
sport science and
weird tangents a porn that's about it
oh there's some talking on this one
who said uh paul said
lyle doesn't even look like someone who
lifts weights lol
burn incineration
flyless ded
do you remember like a couple years ago
so people were saying
lol and then they started saying l-e-l
because they're like some guy made a
typo and then it was like cool to do
that
and then this is really trippy some
insult
uh like mistyped it as k-e-k so it was
kek and then like for a few months
people were trying to be like cat cat
cat and i'm like what the are you
doing and like people who really weren't
into that subculture were trying to do
with their
cat cat i'm like what what shut up
and thankfully they shut up but it was
like painful level of
 deep dive memeology alt-right
internet psychoticism that was just like
sometimes you don't know too cause like
my spanish-speaking friends will say
like
yeah you know j-a-j-a is like ha ha ha
ha i look at that as like
ja jaja or something like what's that
i'm like oh wait no it's speaking of the
language it's a hot sound
you can't tell like if it's that or if
it's something else if it's right
internet right am i missing the boat
here or is kek
the stupidest thing anyone's
ever invented that's what my cat does
when he sees a bird
oh he makes weird sounds right yeah it's
crazy that you think like you know what
a cat does or like cats meow and
sometimes they hiss and around they do
that too
and then and then you see them interact
with a bird and you're like you have an
entirely different subcategory of like
personality
like it's so weird it's like never it's
like aliens have a human in isolation
and like he talks he's a nice guy this
and that and then they introduce like
a member of the opposite sex he's
attracted to and they're like what's he
doing he never
does this you know you know he's got
this whole other part of him that he
doesn't even like so
yes my ferocious little killer he low
could up a bird or two right
yes he up mice all the time
he actually he does the thing where he
like
beats them within like an inch of their
life and then toys with them for like
hours i'm like dude then i have to just
kill it i'm like dude you're a horrible
animal just kill this mouse
already
yeah speaking of killing mice want to
get to the first one
let's do it don't move your screen
because you got them right at the bottom
got it ali has got some
on his mind holy cow he's got a lot of
uploads too
well done i'll leave very well done for
some reason it was one of the only ones
to get a lot of uploads it wasn't a joke
um all right he says hi docs i'm having
a very difficult time applying many of
your autoregulatory concepts that are
needed in practice to find volume
landmarks
adjust training parameters sets reps
frequency evaluate sfr and decide when
to deload
is because i'm very unsure of how
different indicators are supposed to
actually feel
such as the mind muscle connection
muscle disruption muscle pump systemic
fatigue etc
i conceptually understand these
indicators after having have read three
of your books the volume recovery and
hypertrophy book
god damn that's a good start and watch
most of your videos but i'm still
struggling to apply them
in most muscles for example i couldn't
feel
any difference after doubling my arm's
volume beyond the fact that performance
continuously
drop after each set aside from running
out of breath the only fatigue i feel is
locally during the set which immediately
disappears after i put down the weight
no pump uh burn or disruption and the
only reliable soreness i get is for
quads ham's calves
dr mike once mentioned that this is an
oral for beginners but i don't think
this is the case because i've been
lifting for around four years
bench squat deads is 225 315 405
respectively
for six to eight reps beside the
possibility i'm still a beginner
hopefully any advice on how to evaluate
sfr
and auto regulate volumes and deloads if
i can't properly assess these indicators
lastly i want to thank you for truly
amazing content we keep providing free
for the community between the q and a's
made simple videos and advanced
concepts lectures the number of
subscribers and views you get is
criminally low and incredible
some people need to be charged for that
prosecution used to go to
youtube jail mark zuckerberg
even he runs youtube right it's all the
same cabal i refuse to believe that gene
the google and
zuck are on different terms they need to
fix my because
i i watched like one strong man video
lately and now
all of my social media is exclusively
world's strongest man videos i'm like
look i love this but
enough come on yeah they're like oh this
is what you like
you have all of it yeah i had a similar
problem
where i was telling myself that i was
searching for strong man
but i was really searching for s and m
and it's all just porn
and i like it so it's good
anyway i also call social media s m a
little social and
media oh that's a good one that is good
it ends up
right let's let's get to answering
ali's question so great question
good news you don't need hardly any of
these things to do a good job in
training
what you need to do is you need to track
your performance and everything else is
really highly secondary to that
so you just add a wrap or add five
pounds to the bar every week
at any given volume that is just
normally within the range you think it
would cause hypertrophy just from the
literature alone
in our um our renderization
site has a whole section on every muscle
group
rough uh targets for med-mrv are covered
so just
shoot literally in the middle of that
range start with three reps in reserve
and then uh increase the load and or
reps
over and over and over a week after week
after week when your performance caps
and falls
that is unequivocal you don't need and
you need to perceive
anything you should be like know how to
count and so you hit
you know 225 for 14 reps on the bench
and then next week you hit 230 for
12 reps that's a decrease in performance
if the next workout you have later that
week again all your numbers are down
that's it it's time for you to deload
and then you can go
and construct your next message cycle
now as far as what kind of volumes to
choose because that's really the only
question that's really left over is just
try to choose volumes that are a little
different
so if you had really good results with
an average of 10 cents per week per
muscle
try an average of six to eight and see
how that next meso goes you might be
like yeah you know like i just the gains
just weren't as good
the rep strength hasn't increased as
much my pump like my muscles don't look
as big
and then sorry or rather they just it
didn't seem to increase much
when you try another mezzo where you do
like you know
12 to 14 sets instead of roughly 10 and
then you're like you have the greatest
uh you know growth of your life and your
performance of skyrocketing and
everything like that the next meso
you're the strongest you've ever been
you know man i feel like yes that's
the better answer at the end of the day
those are the rock-solid shits we want
to go on anyway
because pomp and mind muscle connection
and stuff they're very very subjective
and it's not ultra powerful now this
entire time that you're doing this for
years
of just performance oriented tracking
and auto regulation
you need to be aware and just try to
sort of sit with
the language your body is speaking to
you and get a little bit more nuanced
it's kind of like
so so basically like um you know you try
to assess the pump
after various sets and right now it's
not working at all yeah i don't know i
don't have a pump
but after a few years you'll be like
okay like my chest definitely feels a
little bit harder after four sets of
bench press
then after four sets of dumbbell press
are like definitely harder after two
sets
then after three or sorry then after you
know sorry harder after like six sets
then after three or something like that
okay i feel like i get a better pump
from six then from three that means like
i probably shouldn't be stopping at
three right there's something to get
between four
five and six mind muscle connection an
easy one is like do you feel the tension
in that muscle versus another muscle and
that's something that's kind of hard to
pick up
but you can get better at it so at some
point you're like okay this tension is
definitely like someone's like how are
these cable curls feeling like
that i feel my forearms a lot but i
don't feel my biceps a ton they're like
okay great we'll
just say it's not the greatest sfr ever
because the tension's low to the bicep
let's try these dumbbell curls you try
and you're like oh yeah just a little
bit more in the bicep
that's a start just being able to
differentiate even the big rocks so for
example your
high bar deep high rep squats here and
single leg bosu ball squats here like
you're gonna have to the quads have to
feel a little different
they have to the pump's got to be a
little different all the stuff in the
middle you might be not
so good at differentiating it's not a
big deal just try to listen to the
language it's kind of kind of like this
like if you don't speak arabic at all
but you have to live
in like beirut for three years you just
like
interacting with locals and just
listening to what they're saying like
after every time
most times their lady gets like she buys
like a thing of nuts or
grapes or something from a shop owner he
says something and she says something
after a while you're like i think she's
saying thank you
and when you see that there's people
like not nice facial expressions in your
hands or something and she doesn't say
that word or she says something else
you're like
yeah that word's definitely like thank
you and you ask your friend he's like
that is thank you so are you going to
learn arabic like that probably not
but are you going to be able to pick up
some and make some sense of what's
going on
of course right so uh so final word here
from me and then we'll get to james
you don't need a ton of this
just try your best to listen to it while
using exclusively performance as your
auto regulatory measures
yeah excellent answer and i agree with
dr mike here one thing i would add is
that um so
you've read our books so you know that
we are big fans of using both like
pre-planned
periodization and fatigue management
strategies and auto regulatory ones
the problem that you are seeming to run
into is that you might be leaning too
heavily on auto regulation
when you don't have a huge grasp of a
lot of some of this baseline stuff yet
which
is perfectly fine so you want to use
both
in your programming right but when you
are kind of and i know you might not be
a beginner in terms of your training age
but in terms of your
developing a sense for volume landmarks
sfr those types of things it sounds like
you're a little bit more on the beginner
side on the knowledge end which is
totally fine
so in that case what i would say is you
might want to just lean more towards
pre-planning
and pre-planning is good in the sense
that it will allow you to just
not have so much noise in the decisions
that you make where
you might run uh let's just say a block
so you did three mesos and they were it
was all pre-planned
by the end of the three you'll have a
pretty good idea of like which exercises
were not good choices which rep ranges
were not good choices for
certain muscles did you deload at the
proper time or not
did you have enough sets yes or no you
know these are things that will work
themselves out essentially through a
very
rigid trial and error the problem that
when uh you don't really have a feel for
like how many sets should i be doing
what's a good sfr rep range for this
muscle and you try to auto regulate
those things you end up just trying a
bunch of and making no progress
where it's like mike gave the example
with the cable curls and you're like
i'm feeling these in my forearms a lot
and so you might be quick to say let's
switch to something else
when the reality is maybe you should
stick with that cable curl for
a couple mezzos and figure out where
your groove is on the cable curl
before you throw it away and say this
isn't a good variation for me or this
isn't a good sfr movement
and that's the benefit of using the
pre-planned where you just say like i'm
gonna do like a very reasonable sequence
of things
and then i'll reevaluate them at the end
and then as you get a better feel for
like okay
seems like my mevs and mrvs are you know
roughly this it seems like these
movements are pretty good
then auto regulation becomes more and
more helpful and so by the time you kind
of get to that like
intermediate stage you're kind of doing
like a little like a 50 50
and then once you get to more advanced
stage like a dr mike it's looking
mostly like auto regulation and less
like pre-planning but for beginners it's
going to look more like pre-planning
with a little bit of auto-regulation
and that's how you figure out a lot of
this out so it's kind of like just
i don't want to say trial by fire but it
is kind of like set a plan
execute it and then re reevaluate how it
went and that's how you dwindle some of
these choices down
boom perfect yeah and just to one say
one last quick little thing
a lot of people don't know to be in tune
with these things or they're in tune
with them improperly and they're massive
ripped guys
because they just steadily train with a
little bit more load and a few more reps
all the time
because it's just ego and they're just
like i need to pull it like i'm working
how many times you see bodybuilding be
like yeah
starting off this offseason doing four
plates on the hacksaw i'd really like to
get to like five plates at the end of it
like
 that's it you just
discovered all the training right there
quads grew right there that's for sure
yeah you can't go from four plates to
five plates when they're that big
already
without growth and if you cheat your
technique james well pretend that you
did fast
you know that that's not even an option
for us we talked about this last time
that's right that's right
sticky some people will like post like
hack squat pr and you look at it like
you think you're hack squatting but
you're not
yeah what are you doing all right uh oh
heck funny enough this is really mean
but i won't say who this is
i don't think i know who this is but
there's uh some folks training at uh
the gym i train at and they were using
they're like pound guys but like pretty
high level of body fat
and just like strong dudes and this they
were using big beefy men
yeah they were using leg press one of
the grades like presses ever assembled
actually
and they were using like very partial
rom and they were doing like 10 plates
on the side and then like plates on top
and all this stuff
and i literally would just record a
video it'll be out in a few months
probably a few weeks
with uh briani terry who's one of the
top
three 165 pound female power lifters of
all time
and she squats like for sure to depth
more than these guys like
 for a fact right she was doing
in our video
275 pounds total including the
live press
like with proper techniques just kind of
like and her quads are just objectively
bigger than theirs it's just kind of
like
templates versus two plates and a
quarter like you don't think this is
weird you don't think something's a
little off
that's what always kills me right where
i'm like i get that there's ego involved
but also like you're looking around the
room
get a feel for you know i don't know
just seems stupid like
if that was me and i look over and you
know
i see somebody else doing full rom and
they have bigger legs than me with way
less weight i'd be like
i had a moment like that when uh this
one kid was an olympic weightlifter at
the university of michigan i was 19 and
i was half squatting because just know
any better
and i watched him do pretty lightweight
squats two plates on each side
but he sunk into like absurd obnoxious
weight lifter depth where i swear to god
his touched the ground
and his quads were like big bigger than
mine and i was like
i'm gonna pretend i didn't see that i'm
gonna tell no one about this i'm just
instantly gonna start squatting all the
way down
so i don't feel pathetic anymore i don't
like feeling like this and then i
started squatting lower and i was like
okay great now and then i'll benefit
anyway yeah um all right next up is
strength hacks coaching
what the put a regular hacker on
our hands there he is axor
computers numbers input output
he asks uh what are your favorite
primary movements for each muscle group
to maximize so far well some of them are
included in our muscle hypertrophy
guides on the rhinestone periodization
website um
first answer second of all a huge caveat
to anything james and i will share after
this james and i will give like two or
three muscle groups we're not gonna go
through all and it's kind of insane
there's like 14 or some like that
uh we just give like an exercise or two
for some of the ones we
really like think you should maybe try
we can do quick hittery you name one and
we'll be like
mike one two james one two next quick
i'm like
back you're like oh i don't know what he
says
 lateral right did i get it wrong
like you actually got your own question
wrong
um so dude i should write like a spoof
article like
biomechanics like why the
lateral raise is the best back movement
you'll ever do
it would be like dr mike said dude they
literally i'm sure some people would be
like see
told you um so the huge caveat to
anything james and i share is this
and this is i'm gonna try to say this in
the nicest way possible
it does not matter because i
used to be a big believer that some
movements were objectively better than
others
uh like as far as like black and white
now i think
at the extreme end some movements are
for sure for most people at all
and at the other end some movements are
really good for most people and
not all like
high bar squat versus bosu ball squat
like look you someone on this earth
actually legitimately gets a better quad
workout with both of the ball squats
than hybrid squats
i i don't actually doubt that but that
person is one enough a billion or some
 like that
so when we share with you a couple of
exercises that work for us
we want you to really really
contextualize this comes not just from
us but from everyone that trains
some the movement is always and
everywhere personal
sfr is your own individual variable you
calculate and it is king
it's like i will never in a million
years like when i program for people
like i program for charlie uh charlie
says hey like on this machine bench i
actually get a better workout than i do
on dumbbell press
now i like dumbbell presses better than
machine bench but if he says
he knows his volume landmarks and he
knows his perceptive indicators really
well
he knows what tension is in the muscle
he knows what joint pain is he's like i
get a better pump better stretch better
tension and very little joint pain
compared to a regular dumbbell press i'm
never going to tell charlotte no
dumbbell press is better because it's
free weight what the
he's like clearly it's working better
for him to do this other thing so
it's all down to you and individually
now i'll start with saying
that i really like the barbell heavy
compound high range of motion basic
movements for almost everything so you
want big shoulders
you do barbell upright roads you want
big biceps you do barbell curls all the
way up and down
high bar squats stiff legged deadlifts
good mornings
barbell rows from a deficit barbell
bench barbell incline
if those movements are in and you do
respond well to them you're going to get
a lot out of them
they've dealt my body a huge uh amazing
hand
of muscle over the years and i'm in love
with them but i also know that a lot of
people don't like them
so it's caveat a big time but that's
just what i like please do not assume
that that's going to
what's going to be getting you your best
sfrs james what do you think
yeah so i think like you know when we
give recommendations for sfrs again as
mike said that's kind of like an
aggregate recommendation of like more
often than not these are probably pretty
good choices but again it always comes
down to you
like for me like i'm like a weird mixed
bag of like um
something's uh really big range of
motions really great for me so like i'm
cambered bar bench press is really good
like deep as dumbbell chest flies
really good um knee extension and
squat
bench thing i don't know what you call
it squat stand
uh oddly good for me normally we would
say like you should probably think about
leg press or squats
i just end up using a bunch of my other
synergistic muscles on those and
for whatever reason these are just
better for me on the quads it's just me
um other things like uh cable curls
cable triceps work really good for me
um trying to think of some other ones
45 degree back raise it's like legendary
for me hamstrings
yeah for hamstrings um
that's all i can really think oh uh
cable cable straight arm lap pulls
really good like would i if i was
programming for someone would that be
the first thing i would program for back
absolutely not
um i would probably start with some kind
of pull down or pull up or a row
variation but for me
because i'm stretch armstrong over here
just and i also am heavy so i suck at
pull-ups
those work really good but again these
are all just like individual things like
would i necessarily program
for people that way not unless they
indicated that this is a good movement
for them
yeah very cool so there it is
just do like toucan sam does
follow your nose ah wherever it goes
to the flavors of fruit he's a
he seems to be one of the serial
characters that doesn't immediately
scream psychopath
a lot of them dougie and i were talking
about this a lot of the serial
characters are literally like drug
addicts
like oh yeah they're like cuckoo for
coco crisp or whatever that guy was on
meth dude they're like wigging out and
they need their fix it's terrible
do you saw the rick and morty or the
edition of uh yeah oh yeah
like you just gotta cut the
lucky charms out of the guys
um all right here we go
nog heads n-o-g-a
nog heads let's see that sounds like one
of those
like fat heads or whatever those little
bobble head things that you can get
oh yeah by the way i saw a lot of people
mentioning that chainsaw man is getting
an anime
so i'm very excited thanks for for
tuning me in on that it's awesome i'm
super stoked
 nerds all right hey docs i'm
using the rp male physique template but
i have one question about progression
that i can't seem to find an answer
i understand each week i will try to
beat the reps from the week before match
or beat
uh or match or beat the reps um from the
week before if
the weight has increased however what's
not clear to me is what my target reps
should be for the second exercise for
the same muscle group if i've increased
the number
of sets in the first exercise for that
muscle group it seems increased fatigue
for the first exercise make it difficult
to match the second rep
exercise from the week before please
help so hey check this out really good
answer for you
um if you're going to make rep jumps for
rir make smaller rep jumps for that
second exercise
so you for the first you might add two
reps every week for a while for the for
the second one
maybe just one maybe zero so so i put it
this way
if you did five sets of leg presses and
then you did some certain performance in
squats afterwards
the next week you did six sets of leg
press just tying that first
performance is an equivalent of a
relative overload
uh a relative progression because you
tied it under a higher fatigue locally
circumstance so it's actually a bigger
stimulus
right so sometimes just hanging in there
is good enough so for example
if i'm doing let's say a bunch of bench
presses first
and then a bunch of uh wide grip dips
after for chest
i might progress on bench press from 225
to 250
over the course of four or five week
mesocycle matching reps the entire time
for dips i might start with 15 dips on a
first set of body weight
and end at 15 dips at body weight on the
first set at the end of the thing you'll
be like oh my god you didn't get strong
at all
but i'm benching 250 for six sets now
before
and i was mentioning 225 for three cents
now sometimes you won't be able to keep
up
and you'll actually hit failure and and
start to your reps will start to drop
does that mean you hit mrv no mrv is
only ever assessed by the first exercise
in that muscle group for that session
that's how you tell your performances
everything else after is residual
fatigue is it okay to go to failure on
all the other exercises after
yeah for sure it's not a big deal
especially for like one or two weeks
towards the end of the meso
no big deal just grind it out try to get
your performance uh no
no nobody lost nobody found but that's
another really good emphasis
for um the idea that even your second
exercise
should really start at three or four rar
in that first week
it's like if you're like yeah the first
actually i go through before i are up
then i feel warmed up
i go close to failure on the second one
like you will be going really to failure
and then beyond failure if you're trying
to match performance
later in the mezzo so that's kind of the
best tips to go about that but you're
absolutely right and recognizing you're
not going to make the same jumps of
performance or maybe any at all
over the course of the meso for the
second and sometimes even third exercise
and that's just the way love goes
i'm glad you brought up that point there
at the end typically what i find is when
people are having that problem is
because they're training
too hard too high of a god damn it
they're training too hard their rir
is not scaled accordingly for the
subsequent exercises they're going too
hard
also consider too right so it's feasible
that you would be biasing
it's it's feasible that you would pick
the first exercise as like your highest
sfr
for that particular session and you
would buy us more of your your volume
progressions and whatnot
to that particular exercise and so you
can expect that anything downstream of
that
is going to be getting the tail end so
as mike said any of those secondary
tertiary or anything
after that sometimes just a strategy of
just matching what you did is perfectly
fine because
you might be adding multiple sets to the
first exercise or more weight on the bar
simply because you're biasing more of
your volume to that particular movement
because it's better for you
um so in that case you might not see the
same aggressive progressions in the
subsequent exercises especially if
they're ones where you typically don't
make big jumps in weight or big jumps
and sets anyway
so it would if you like if we're using
the example of bench and then dips
you might be doing you know in weeks
three and four or five if you go up that
high
something pretty similar to what you did
in week one in terms of sets and the
weights that you're using
but you actually saw a huge increase in
weight and or sets on the first on the
bench pressing movement because it's the
one that's giving you the biggest
stimulus
so in that case it's okay to just match
and frankly i would say it's even if
you're not
matching like if you're a couple reps
off here or there if you're still
hitting your major indicators of like
pumped
mind muscle connection and soreness on
those things i think you can make a case
that says like a couple reps here and
there probably doesn't matter as long as
you're still getting
those ghetto mev type indicators in
that's in those exercises
so that's the thing with hypertrophy
it's just more forgiving than a lot of
other training methods like power
strength
all those things are ruthless when it
comes to hitting your intensity
thresholds
but hypertrophy training a couple reps
here there
is if you're getting a good pump you
feel it and you're sore from it like
you're probably fine
next up vasil
got it the rp logo a seal i like that
my seal's opinion does not represent
those of renaissance periodization where
it's affiliates
uh hey docs i keep getting these muscle
slash nerve spasms when training
bake technique and exercise execution
are safe cable rows mainly manifests
when i do the top hold which has been
non-negotiable as of late because i have
mind muscle connection problems and
training back
pause you can get a big ass back with no
mind muscle connection at all dude
pro bodybuilders are all the time
there's a heap weights around like
 morons and they have biggest
backs in the world so and i
i think that's the total value like the
cable row like you
again people are different but dr mike
and i seem to be in agreement on this
one and we have vastly different
anthropometry like
cable rows are sometimes really hard to
get right without doing like a peak
contraction or like an exaggerated mind
muscle protocol so that might be
at play here too yeah and it makes me
almost free slash snap when it occurs
it's like my back is short circuiting
from the stimulus any ideas
unfortunately say what just don't do
that do something else
yeah unfortunately none at all the thing
is is like when you
if you're going to see so the only way
to really resolve this is to talk to a
person who's a professional
um a physical therapist or a sports
medicine musculoskeletal professional
probably a medical doctor and the
diagnostic processes
unfortunately have quite quite a lot of
contact with sports medicine it's just
not a level of advancement we would like
to have
for bodybuilding and powerlifting where
you say like
the number one thing guarantee you when
you say i have this weird spasm when i
do this movement
they're like okay is it getting away
with your life like no
what about other exercises can you do
that you're like yeah and then you're
like which is don't do it that's the
first thing you're going to tell you
and if you want to increase the sort of
a diagnostic
magnitude they're going to like do some
stuff where they
um they might do some imaging or they
might
press on some pain centers and pressure
points and stuff and see if what's going
on
does it probably have some candidate
nerves that might be getting impinged
and that's probably what's happening
like when your arch retract
you're you're like sort of crushing some
nerve in there not crushing just
impinging on it and it fires off and it
 spasms the out of your back
and a lot of times the human body is
designed in an interesting and imperfect
way and
sometimes your muscles get bigger or
some other muscle gets bigger or the
body moves around a way it's
gonna stop happening like for a while
like i'll go through phases where i have
like my elbow
uh i'll have like the ulnar nerve do
this like blast during tricep extensions
you ever have that james where it's like
your pinky hurts and you're like ah
it feels like electricity going through
your and and then sometimes it just
doesn't
uh and it just goes for years without
doing it and it's not some months it
just starts doing it
so i would say just stay away from that
exercise do other ones and then slowly
come back to it a few months later
see if it's okay yes you can go the
sports medicine route and try to figure
out what the problem is
unfortunately it's very likely going to
be a laborious and probably fruitless
endeavor
james yeah i agree i also think like you
know
using comparable exercises is another
good way of troubleshooting this one
like can you do bent over rows or like
one arm dumbbell rows and like those
don't
have the same problem no okay well then
it's probably something you're doing on
this
this movement explicitly or the way that
it's loaded to me like if you can do
pull downs and and bent over rows and
two guard dumbbells
if you can do similar movements and you
don't have any problems with those it's
just this one
all signs point to like either the
movement or the technique that you're
using within the movement
that that would that would be how i
would look at that but again
i think the simple answer is like if
you're getting weird spasms
just pick something else find another
movement especially i don't know
has your opinion changed on this since
we talked about this dr mike i always
found cable rose to be like okay
but you need to do like 10 sets of them
to get like anything going raw stimulus
magnitude is just straight garbage for
me
yeah and other people swear by them but
like if i do them
heavy bodybuilder swinging style the my
muscle connection
doesn't exist and i'm like i could do 10
sets of this and i would just get really
tired
and if i do them with a really good peak
attraction a really good technique
i can do test sets i'm not very tired
and i have a slight pump
and a slight degree of like oh i'm
getting a stimulus in my back but i'm
like why am i doing
i can do three sets of barbell bent rows
and be like i'm done for the day that's
all the back work i need
or i can sit in the cable row
for 10 sets sometimes is just like
uh that's just
the way love goes you know yeah yeah
twice it's odd when like you and i have
similar
sfr issues with one movement because
usually we tend to be a little bit
like polar opposites because we're built
differently you know so it's interesting
when that happens
yeah it's really trippy too when you see
um
you uh you get like uh
you know multiple people saying that the
same exercise sucks
but then you see like some people
getting on the cable row and
doing like the mid-range of motion just
like this
with that little yellow handle oh yeah
and i'm just like
can you describe to me what you think is
happening there
and a lot of times like i said uh
earlier to the gentleman that uh leon
asked you know how important is this my
mouse connection stuff
and that guy's probably really big you
know yeah again there's no way
like we've had we've traded with plenty
of people now in rp and i've trained a
whole bunch
james has off camera but we got plenty
of people in training videos who look at
us dumbfounded after we teach them how
to do an exercise and do a couple hard
working sets they're like
i didn't even know i had muscles in that
area and you're like well yeah like
 happens you know you do right
but a lot of people don't and they still
get really good results just not the
best results
so the you know cable rows you know yeah
you could
make them work and a lot of people love
them but a lot of people just kind of do
them and they still do something
i just to me it's just a giant waste of
time
yeah this is the prime example of like
when you're doing movement training
versus muscle training like well this is
a movement that you can do but is it
training your muscles like
100 all right next up is you're gonna
have to search for this james
oh daisho otoko who
better be japanese because if he's not
you
you just got elected to king weeb
[Laughter]
amazing amazing james remember that text
i sent you
that yeah meme i love like
the uh would you wish there's a name for
that because it's not hem thai there's a
more specific name
right for what that is well hentai
is like porn
that usually they call that like waifu
kind of stuff or waifu
yeah so it's like so here's the thing
that stuff's all good and well and i
don't have a problem the whole the
following is just a joke
everyone's like james knows too much
about this right
but like what trips me out again this is
just a joke
is like when people use these
waifu little memes to make like
serious points or insert them into
actual conversation like i remember like
during the trump election time they like
turned these waifu things into like
manga things where it was like a girl
girl on a tank and she's like oh my god
trump and you're like
can you explain to me how this relates
to geopolitics
and they're like well you see let's go
you jack off to big japanese titties in
your face
and you love that just say it
they're like well yeah like why do you
have to mix jacking off in politics it
doesn't make any goddamn sense to me
it's just a joke stay calm and sound
with you so even
for me it's sometimes they're like they
go way over my head
i don't even get like the pepe frog ones
i might look at i'm like what's the joke
right i get it yeah i'm like at least
pepe like for sure
only stands for one thing which is like
alt-right
speak truth to power say politically and
correct
fine okay but like the waifu stuff is
designed to be like you look at and
you're like yeah these
 but then like it's like donald
trump like i don't want to think about
donald trump what i'm looking at yeah
he's taking
out of my face i may very well not ever
want to think about donald trump as a
matter of fact next we're gonna be
making these shits for joe biden i'm
really gonna get this
he's donald trump's still calling my
house pretty regularly
that's awesome i never get any calls
from him yeah
so my parents are one of the top donors
to the trump campaign in the
state of michigan how are you not
getting phone calls he calls me like
twice a day
hey james it's johnny i'm back i'm gonna
i'm gonna be back in some way shape or
form
uh if you guys are looking at my screen
share here there is a
i can't take my eyes off this guy with
the bench press situation
this uh 34 workout fails you don't want
to repeat look at this guy
oh boy holy that man is in a bad
place
that is not where you want to be yikes
all right let's hit this uh let's hit
this potentially
nice japanese guy i don't know i was
like
thanks for going into waifu just from
seeing my name
yeah there's like a real japanese
culture and there's like japanese
exports white people are in too
well actually and black people some of
the most dedicated weebs are
like the occasional black weeb is like
usually real hardcore into the ship
paul canoe we're talking about you god
damn it somebody tagged paul in this
yes um especially like naruto
yeah yeah our friend uh paul is uh ifb
professional bodybuilder he's a
phenomenal guy just all-around great guy
and he's he's black he's actually
african and
he james i gotta tag you in some of the
 i might have he does like a review
of his favorite animes
on instagram oh sweet this
writes like a 10-page paper on
each one and it's like ratings and sub
ratings like god damn paul
holy like he doesn't wait i
actually think i might know who you're
talking about
he doesn't simply watch anime he absorbs
it it's intense videos
right uh does he do videos and he for
sure does posts he might do videos
i think an ultra jacked black dude okay
maybe a different guy then yeah yeah but
like oh
there's no shortage of people doing
anime review videos i'll tell you that
but
it's just it's just it's just funny to
me like how in depth and it was
no no i'm saying we all like our
but like i was like god damn because he
watches the same you do james of
like the most obscure anime ever
and it was like some of these ones it's
just like a story of a kid in high
school and there's no action there's no
like real plot it's just like a kid in
high school and paul's like i really
love the character development i'm like
what
there's like certain genres like that i
watched the one that was i just like
picked a shot in the dark one last night
like it almost brought me to tears don't
i don't remember it was called but it
was basically like
this omniscient being is like sent to
earth it uh like
mimics things so it like mimicked being
a rock for a while and then it mimicked
like being moss and then it encountered
a wolf
and the wolf dies in front of it so then
it like it
it mimics being a wolf and experiences
consciousness for the first time and it
finds this guy and they live in
like norway or whatever
long story short the guy like the wolf
is like the guy's only friend and the
guy
like goes to find his family who left
and he finds like their caravan
they're all dead he like gets into an
accident
he dies he like tells like this
omniscient alien being who's a wolf he's
like remember me because you were like
my only friend he dies that's like the
end of the episode
i was like it was awful what the
but as charlie tells me it makes you
feel
feelings it did it did i was like god
damn this isn't what i thought this was
gonna be
i thought this was like sci-fi
there you go
yeah all right
sorry milo milo good luck labeling this
answer um
hey doctors dr james i happen to have a
bill more similar to you 195 centimeters
tall 200 centimeter wingspan
fluctuate between 90 and 100 kilograms
do you have any specific recommendations
for growing arms
and pull-ups or should i stick to
specialization cycles
yeah yeah that's that's a tough one so
pull-ups is one like
for i think for tall lanky people
especially if you're on the heavy side
like i
you know i'm fairly muscular so i have a
lot of weight as well and pull-ups are
just one like i have never
made a ton of progress i've always been
kind of shitty at it
whereas things like cool downs is
something that i can make tangible
noticeable improvements just because of
either the biomechanical differences or
that i just don't have to lug
my big old body around so what i have
found for me
uh for any of the back stuff
i started using more back isolation in
the form of either dumbbell or cable
straight on poles
and sometimes i'll use those as either a
pre-exhaust or as their own thing or
sometimes i've even done metabolite
training on that
and then a combination of like for me
like underhand close
grip type pull downs tends to work
really well and tends to be really
responsive
for arms the specialization phases have
been key for me
and one of the things i've gotten away
from was doing a lot of like just
standing straight up barbell curls
because i tend to
sway a lot just as a result of it having
to travel a really long distance
and i tend to get like a lot of shoulder
synergy so i have used a lot more like
isolation type things like um
incline curls spider type curls
like a chest supported kind of like
position curl all those are kind of like
spider curls more or less
um those types of things have been
really helpful in increasing the sfr
of training my biceps whereas like just
doing barbell curls or easy curls like i
get a little bit of bicep but i get a
lot of just
other stuff too and it just never really
feels all that great like i could do
sets of curls with like 105 if i wanted
to but then
all that ends up happening is that my
wrists and elbows get up after a
while and then i do
my arms don't grow that much more um
other ones for like triceps
have typically been like um like
high emphasis on my muscle connection
and eccentric accentuation on cable
triceps pushdowns
that's always been a really good one for
me um
jm presses are really good but there's
like a risk reward on that one they tend
to
really irritate my elbows as well what
other ones have been really good
the specialization phases have
definitely been necessary and
i think ultimately like you kind of have
to break the mold on
a lot of the aggregate kind of sfr
choices like if you say like okay
pull ups for back like that's just an
arms that's just not going to work for
you you just got to have to find
and mess around with some different
variations i do a bunch of weird
that i would never like have my clients
do like this morning i did
um cable straight arm uh
cable straight arm lap you know things
for like sets of you know five to ten
i did those as pre-exhaust and then i
did close grip underhand pull downs for
a few more
sets then i did some like chest
supported rows and then i did um
easy curl easy bar spider curls for like
three or four sets and then i did cable
curls for mile reps after that
and would i ask other people to do it
that way no it's just one of the few
things that seems to really get me going
whereas other things kind of don't so i
think
think outside the box in terms of your
high sfr choices and don't be afraid to
try weird
um
looks like gains are incoming hopefully
yeah specialization definitely i mean
like i did i haven't really masked a
whole lot just because i'm pretty happy
with my
weight and size currently but when i
have done specialization phases i mean
like
i have the the blessing of being you
know like half
type 2a half type 1 so it basically
means i train arms every day
on a specialization phase which you know
is cool but it also sucks
yeah all right next up is
wtf is that cream all one word
james i think that's like way down the
list
yep got it all right
so oh boy
for someone who was born with bad calf
genetics and didn't have naturally big
caps like some people seem to have me
that was me what would your long-term
approach
to be to build an impressive set of
calves in terms of programming and
exercise selection
do you think it's doable and so would be
their roles to goals in terms of time
required to achieving a meaningful
increase
in size and slash how much bigger could
they get so i'll answer this kind of in
reverse
how much bigger than can they get you'll
never know until you try um
because that is uh something that
you know so your ability your adaptive
ability and your ceiling
are actually genetically a little bit
different than your initial muscle size
so some people have pretty impressive
initial tabs
they don't grow all that much and some
people have like pretty small initial
calves myself
and then when they started training them
especially when they did it right the
cavs
slowly but steadily grew over time to
answer that um middle part of your
question
how much time would be realistic to
get a meaningful increase in size i
think if you're doing the right thing
especially if you're gaining weight most
of the time
if your calves aren't bigger in about a
year notably then like
yeah yeah you gotta have it really rough
um i think they still grow for almost
everyone but it just might be like if
you can't tell
a difference in really hammering them
for a year either you're up
somehow which shouldn't
uh or you're really not in the cards for
you to get much bigger calves
um and lastly how do you do it well you
just go renaissance periodization
and there is a muscle group guide for
calves
and it tells you absolutely everything
you need to know to get a really good
program together
frequency volume load progression
exercise
videos selection tips my rep stuff
all of it so just go ahead and uh get
into that
and that should give you all the answers
james
yeah definitely agree and cavs is just
one of those like it's kind of
either you got it in you or you don't
sometimes i actually have a client
right now who did a lower body emphasis
mass phase and like a special and i i
made a big effort to include a lot of
calf work in there because they
their quads and butt and like posterior
chain muscles
just are massively responsive like every
time we do a mass phase it's like
boom so you got the front end and the
back end really coming out and then just
like
sign post caps yeah right and it sucks
and so i was like this time we're gonna
do like
you know four a four mesolong
mass we're gonna do a big calf emphasis
and guess what happened legs kept
growing calves did not
so it just increases the ridiculousness
of this person unfortunately and
they're a good sport but yeah sometimes
you just have to do those like
specialization type things or they're
just not it's just not going to happen
and that might be one where you don't do
like obviously a calf specialization is
probably not an economical use of time
and calories
but if you are doing a specialization
phase you might consider adding calves
as one of the
the targeted muscles and at that point
you're pretty much going to be doing the
calf
variation virtually every day because
your calves can really take a
a pretty good beating in terms of volume
and frequency
yep yep furious dan who in my view is
right below you'll hear hers as well
very good oh yeah oh he's got a little
little anime action going on there too
james this is one right up your alley so
i'll just let you take this one how
important a sleep schedule consistency
with regard to recovery that is assuming
an equal amount of sleep approximately
eight hours
are shift workers with chaotic sleep
schedules leaving gains on the table and
compared to someone who regularly sleeps
at about the same time every day yes and
james will explain why
yeah absolutely so uh it's one of those
where
the reason why having that schedule is
very important is because it affects
your circadian rhythms which affects
you know a whole lot of different things
like your nervous system activity
endocrine activity just energy levels
and stuff throughout the day when you
have
variation in your sleep schedule it's
often very difficult for people to fall
asleep and or stay asleep or wake up
at different times that you know when
there's variability it's hard for them
to
wake up sleep and fall asleep at the at
the different times that wouldn't be
normal so although you might be getting
you might be giving yourself the same
eight hours of sleep opportunity
you might not actually be getting that
eight hours of sleep because you're just
sitting there for an hour before you can
fall asleep or the quality of that sleep
might not be good
or you might be waking up at a time that
is not optimal for yourself as a result
of changing your schedule around
so i don't want to say it's one of the
most important things but i can say
that when when when we are working on
getting a
sleep with people who say like oh i only
sleep four hours a night or this is that
setting uh setting a consistent wake-up
time
is usually like the first step i will
take with somebody who is doing
something up with their sleep say
just wake up at the same time and let's
work on getting you at least
a sleep opportunity of eight hours maybe
it doesn't work out that way that's okay
but let's wake up at the same time every
day
and then once that becomes routine then
it becomes you know again try and give
yourself that that sleep opportunity of
roughly eight hours
and then formally it becomes okay you
have a bedtime now and let's
work on hitting the bedtime at the same
time getting that opportunity waking up
at the same time
and that's really when you get people
into a good groove on the sleep hygiene
so i do think that you're leaving
something on the table
is it like uh what's the magnitude of
that effect i'm not sure
but i think it would be it would be i
would say a tangible effect over time
like if you're someone who
is has a very variable schedule uh
you're probably not going to make us
as good of gains over time as someone
with a more consistent schedule
um excellent answer james thank you so
much and also just just to clarify
something we're not clarified just to
add a little bit of insight there guys
the reason that you start with setting
event
a wake-up time is because if you set a
bedtime and you can't fall asleep you
just twiddle your thumbs
you end up sleeping in late and that
sleeping in late affects your ability to
fall asleep next night
but if you give yourself a wake-up time
every morning wake up at 8 a.m
if you can't sleep until 1 a.m the night
before
you have to wake up at 8 a.m and then
you'll be so tired towards the end of
the day you'll probably fall asleep at
10 and it'll be no problem
so that wake up day it sucks it's not
news anyone ever wants to hear
like waking up blows the worst part of
the day i think but um
you just got to standardize it if you
want to really fix your sleep yeah
and if you can't then just do your best
and then then it becomes an issue of
like you can do other things for your
sleep hygiene and if you're giving
yourself the proper opportunities
for sleep then you're most of the way
there at that point
all right henrik anderson
oh
god he's right there that's really
convenient for you yeah
uh let's say i did an excruciating leg
workout at the end of the workout i'll
do bicep curls if i were completely
refreshed no systemic or local fatigue
i do 27 reps with 50 kilograms however
do systemic fatigue i have to go 40
kilograms which is way above my 30 rm
to be in the 20 to 30 range since i'm
not on the hyper free range 5 to 30 arm
will this not cause any hypertrophy that
absolutely will cause hypertrophy
but so so 35
reps causes hypertrophy 40 reps causes
it 45 and so does 50. the thing is they
start to fall off after the 30 to 35
range
so that five to 30 is like a guaranteed
you're getting your best results range
you know you get hypertrophy from sets
of one default one to four
and you get a perfect all the way up to
sets of 60. absolutely especially if
you're not super advanced
that works it's just not optimal
right so are you getting hypertrophy
almost certainly are you getting less
than if you did the bicep curls fresh
you are you absolutely are there's no
really way
around that because you're gonna be
you're pretty tired um which is why
training excruciating legs and then
doing biceps after is questionable
so like you might be somebody who can
train biceps maybe four times a week and
so as long as that's not like your your
bicep
big bicep day probably not a huge deal
right you're just
you're getting a light lighter training
day in there and then another day you
might hit it harder
but yeah there's nothing wrong with that
it's okay it's you're still going to
make some
some progress is often better than no
progress right so yep
and he says on a related note if i were
to do eight sets for a must group below
per session mav
and due to local fatigue my strength
drop-off was very high i was curling 50
kilograms fresh but later in the workout
i'm curling
35 kilograms isn't 35 too light to cause
hypertrophy
which is a thorough rule only applying
the current state of muscle is in no
it applies fresh uh but it's just a
flexible rule
so even up to 40 or 45 rm it starts to
you know you still get hypertrophy just
not as much it's just not as as
effective
so like here's an example if you do
hack squats then you do squats then you
do leg presses then you do lunges
and then you decide your leg extensions
and by then you're doing you know
sets in the leg extension that are like
literally your 60 rm or something
our leg extension is growing you that
much assuming you even have any m you
know well you said
below per session immediately but
assuming you have media left over
not really man because you're just so
tired you can't even activate hardly any
motor units
because that really is what's happening
like when you're that weak
it means you're a lot of motor units
aren't even really turning on anymore
because
you know if you they did turn on they'd
not simply produce at least a decent
amount of force and
get you to those higher end values but
if you're so weak that you're way
outside of 30 rm
um and then it's just time to call it
quits so
you know eight cents per muscle group uh
and if your strength uh
you know drop off is really really high
uh
then you as the strength drop off
continues each set gets progressively
less and less effective at stimulating
hypertrophy
so like you know if you started sets of
20 in the squat and then you squat it
until you're doing sets of four with the
same weight
every additional set of four isn't
really causing much more muscle growth
maybe a little bit but just not much so
that's why we have huge emphasis
in all these discussions on quality
getting it in
and and frequency too this is where
frequency helps you guys see all these
bodybuilders training with 20 cents per
muscle group
once a week but how high quality are
those remaining 10 sets after the first
ten
not but they still help but they're not
that comparable whereas if you split it
into
monday thursday you know 10 and 10 man
you actually do get a better performance
both times and marginally more muscle
growth there's very few absolutes here
but yeah marginally will absolutely grow
more muscle if you're more fresh and
less muscle if you're pretty beat up
so i have a similar situation with my
training where i often train uh
delts after legs but one of the things
you have to do is make a conscious
trade-off and say like i'm going to try
and pick exercises which are still high
in sfr
but maybe don't have as much emphasis on
a really big absolute load so
would i grow my delts probably best if i
was doing like heavy presses or heavy
upright rows
sure am i going to be able to do that
after doing my leg workout no for the
exact reasons why you're already saying
the systemic fatigue spillover is pretty
high
what is the effect of doing squats or
good mornings on like an incline
dumbbell curl right well you're probably
only using like 15 pounds anyway are you
gonna go
how much is the drop-off going to be
probably not a much at that point so
what you can often find is um high sfr
movements that don't necessarily
emphasize
a high absolute load and what you find
is that those don't have
quite as much performance drop-off in
many cases so that might be a good
alternative so instead of saying all
right i'm doing
barbell curls with or easy curls with 40
kilograms
maybe i will do you know like a
concentration curl or a spider curl and
you might find that
there's really no drop off or very
little from what you would normally do
and then you have to suffer that penalty
much less than something that is more
demanding like a barbell curl or you
know pick your pick your exercise but i
think you get the idea
another great example that james is uh
in a lot of the training
that we do we'll do like leg curls or
something before we do quad movements
and people like shouldn't you do
compounds first and it's like yeah the
thing is like after leg curls i'm really
warmed up and ready to do
quads and they're not limiting me but
after a hard session of quads the
systemic fatigue
that precludes any valuable work from
being unlike girls and you literally
order matters you can get in the same
order you can have a worse experience um
a good analogy here is it for most
people not all you know having a real
good dinner meal and then dessert after
really just you want dinner and then you
want dessert but if you start with
dessert and then go to dinner for a lot
of people
by the time they get to like we start
with dessert they're like ah this is
really sweet and when they get to the
dinner they're like i'm not even hungry
anymore
it's just the same thing flipped over or
sometimes has a pretty different effect
so give that some thought
yeah absolutely all right hano
hydo h-a-n-o-n-n-o-o-o-n-o
got it uh hi docs i recently came across
a workout plan from chris jones of the
pump chasers youtube channel
what kind of shocked me was the amount
of volume he recommended you do in those
routines
for every muscle group he had two
workouts and every eight days scheduled
in one of those sessions he had 24
sets for chest alone which means 48
cents in a week it was
the same for it was the same for all the
other muscle groups as well it seems to
work for him
his clients too any thoughts so you
gotta be really careful about what works
for people um you never get all the
reporting
uh i'll just throw our own company under
the bus you know the renaissance
periodization we have a lot of
transformation
photos right you say well the rp stuff
seems to work like yeah
or nine out of ten people to try our
 or like dead or injured
or just fat even fatter and then we just
pick the old the winners and it's just a
huge selection bias and it ends up
looking like we're the and i
hopefully we're not doing that i don't
think we are and i think the rp methods
actually work pretty well
but like when people have when people
are famous and they have a lot of
followers and they have a lot of success
stories
you're not there's no statistic there
that you're seeing of what percent of
them actually succeed
and it's easy to you know if you have a
thousand people doing your program all
you gotta do is take the top 20 the
randomly survive the
program you're writing and you're like
look at these guys they're huge and
jacked and they love it you're like oh
it's going to be me and you buy the
program and it shits you over
so now not taking anything away from
chris jones of the pump chasers
um they could very well have really good
programs and a lot of people can
actually recover and adapt
to 48 sets of chests per week it's just
not all people right which is why james
and i are really big on auto regulations
so start at a low end of volume
and progress upwards and see if you get
better results with more volume and if
at some point like you reach 16 cents of
chest for each workout
every you know twice every eight days uh
and then and then going higher seems to
just tire you out you don't get any
better results well then you know 24 is
probably not going to work for you for
some people
you know they can really crank
it is it do i consider it
roughly uh relatively unusual if your
technique is good sfr is good for
exercise and you're going pretty close
to failure
to be able to really benefit from 24
sets per session
uh yeah it's probably unusual but i
think maybe
the pump chasers folks attract a certain
kind of person for whom that really
works and
it's good that they're around it's good
that they have a channel to promote a
diversity of things because
there's other people that like have
crazy mrvs they're just floating around
the universe
and everyone's telling them they do five
through one three sets all one all you
need is one set of failure every nine
days
or some crazy hit and they just
never grew and then they find pump
chasers and i got my god i've
got the best gains in my life so
um you know if you really want to try it
try their program
and if it works well for you like holy
 i had a huge mvp and i never even
knew
but if you're like ooh skeptical try
their program but just cut all the sets
in half and see how it works and if
you're like oh i can recover from this
no problem
add some volume slowly and if you have
trouble recovering then it don't
one thing is like
you know we live in the real world and
there's no ideal programs running around
ours included
so you got to like take what you know
from various youtubers
and and folks that really know their
stuff like no no doubt these folks know
a lot of good
and you got to modify it to what you
think is your best guess at what's going
on
right you can't just verbatim take what
you want and just be like i'm just going
to do the program verbatim
like you're smart you're sharp you're
watching this channel you know some
you look at something you're like yeah
failure every time that i'm gonna
go to where i are and this much volume
 that i'll never recover
so uh i'm just gonna adapt the program
and all of a sudden the program works
really well for you you know you know
doing things just verbatim has its uses
but
uh very limited uses and most of the
time you're going to have to rig things
a little bit
so dr mike was very nice on that one so
i i'm going to be there here we go
james yeah me and james coming out so
yeah i agree with everything dr mike
said but this is one where you'd get the
the skeptical eyebrow this is actually
to me this is more of a morpheus
situation rather than a people's eyebrow
right
so like if i give you the red pill you
have to do 24 sets of chests per session
but what if i gave you a blue pill that
got just as good of a stimulus
but only at eight sets per session what
would you think about that
right i have an answer ready to quote
neo whoa
whoa right so to me when somebody is
doing
that many sets a couple problems just
scream out right the first is are you
doing it for the sake of doing that many
sets and if that's the case
totally fine you're you're a workhorse
uh you know an exercise machine that's
good in its own right fine
um the other question then becomes like
do you need to do that many sets
and if the answer is yes like how are
you assessing that are you looking at
like the
you know ghetto mev indicators that we
talk about all the time
next one comes up is like what's your
technique like on all these movements
because i guarantee
you know the reason why we use those
like kind of i don't remember exactly
what we say i want to say it's you know
like between five and ten sets per week
aggregate mav scores um the reason is is
because that actually works really good
when you control for things like
technique in my muscle connection
right so for me i would say
so like 24 sets of in one session right
you could do
eight sets three times a week right
and get a good workout that's
you're getting you know more than double
the stimulus at that point on a weekly
scale right so to me this would scream
like a combination of like are you doing
it for its own sake
have you actually assessed what you need
for chest you know pick whatever muscle
group
um what is your technique like on all
these movements and i think once you
start whittling down those factors like
have you even thought about sfr right
are you just getting on the like chest
machine like the machine chest press and
you're just
banging this out for as many sets
as until you give up on it like
i think once you start whittling those
factors down you find that like oh i can
actually
get like a really good chest stimulus
from like three sets of deep chest flies
why would i need to add you know 21 more
sets
after that all right you probably don't
that's probably your medium for chest
three boom there you go
um you know so i'd be i'd be skeptical
if somebody
could answer affirmatively on all those
points and say like i have factored all
these things in and
this is what i need to do for chest
because at that point if you're doing 24
sets per session
and you're only training twice a week i
would say like why aren't you just doing
a chest every day at that point
because you clearly can recover from it
you know like
yeah james god damn you that's a really
good point
yeah if you can recover if you can
survive to have a productive set number
20 through 24
in a workout right muscle group yo you
might as well train
four or five times a week for that
muscle group and all the literature
really says you'll probably get even
better gains
so yeah and so hannah that's just kind
of like
you know i think i'm not trying to take
away from what dr mike said cause i
totally agree but that
i would be skeptical of people because i
don't think that
i think those numbers seem somewhat
arbitrary and
maybe not as well thought out or derived
as they could be so what you might find
is you
you start mimicking their program and
you get to like set four or five
on chester legs or whatever and you're
like dude i'm done i'm done
there's nothing more to do and they're
like well you got 20 more sets and
you're like nah you know what i'm going
to call it i'm going to call it
and i'm going to maybe train chest in a
couple days and see how that goes
yep
yep all right so
hey now hey now
hey now
i have no idea what the lyrics to that
song are it doesn't matter
[Laughter]
all right he now says hey docs
or hello docs how healthy is it for a
natural individual with regards to
lifespan and general health marks
to try to go uh trying to go through med
to mrv great question here's the answer
uh not going from mev
to mev plus is a real bad idea because
training
fundamentally extends your lifespan and
it really extends your quality of life
and occasionally providing a pretty
tough stimulus is probably really good
for you too
there's a lot of literature especially
in cardiovascular research that shows
that those kind of health markers that
are boosted
from hard cardio are different than the
ones that are boosted even from lots of
easy cardio and there are some
big health benefits there so if you're
crushing mrv all the time and over
trained all the time and overreached all
the time
it's not good for your longevity it's
not terrible for them but it's you know
general health is not that great um if
you occasionally challenge your body
uh by going through mbv to mrv then
you're probably doing yourself the best
health service you can
in many respects with training and if
you're not training mvpdmrv
then you almost certainly won't have as
good of health as you could and maybe
not even as high longevity
longevity questions a bit complicated
because sometimes when you train really
hard
it increases your quality of life it
slightly decreases your longevity
technically speaking to live the longest
you have to do minimal amount of
physical activity eat a minimal amount
stress almost not at all and sit more or
less in meditation your whole life
yeah i'm not sure if people want to live
like that i sure as hell don't
so um as far as quality of life and and
being able to live a nice
long life hard training is a big part of
the picture so yeah
um absolutely no nothing to be like hey
don't go to mrv you're gonna die soon
 that's that's total
yeah i agree so it to me it seems like
if you are someone who is a
non-exerciser
and you take this idea of training from
mev to mrv all the way up to
someone who is like an intermediate
exerciser or say intermediate athlete
you could you could even apply this idea
to different sports
not just weights um that seems to be a
net benefit overall
but there are more significant
trade-offs as you get into more and
more advanced athletic endeavors whether
that's bodybuilding or
other forms of sport like if you want to
be a top-level rugby guy and play on the
international stage
yeah that's probably going to shave a
few years off of your life and you might
actually be
a little bit crippled at the end that's
just a trade-off that you have to make
for high level of sport in many cases
but i think for most people going from
you know non-exerciser
or non-athlete to intermediate level
which is like five years of training and
you know
not the hardest training that you'll
ever experience um that's just a net
positive
for i think in almost every case the big
trade-offs is when
you know for something like dr mike like
he's carrying a lot of muscle mass a lot
of weight around like that's that's
definitely consequences as a result of
doing that but that's the trade-offs
he's going to make and to participate in
high levels of sport competition so
that's just something that everybody has
to assess for themselves
boom that's our last question
oh that was pretty good those were some
good ones yeah
uh let's see okay a couple updates so uh
hypertrophy audiobook is out
folks you can enjoy that uh you can get
the link on our website
um yeah so if you're too lazy to read
like i
am there you go you get to listen to my
voice all the way through oh yeah
there's a
bug on my microphone really good thanks
i so we converted my um
my uh downstairs into like a big sound
dungeon and the quality came out like
surprisingly good even better than the
last couple ones that we did so i was
really happy with that
um other updates for me uh let's see my
book is in the editing stage so
it's in the hands of dr davis i'm
working on like
piddly stuff like figures and references
and stuff like that right now so it's
that's moving but not
uh not quite there yet mike you got
anything
just super top secret stuff for now but
we're always trying out more youtube
videos so
keep on keeping on folks and
[Music]
remember to up upvote upvote the
questions you want answered
so when you ask your own question maybe
to look at three or four other questions
that you really like and upload them
because a lot of times we're getting
like the funny jokes uploaded which is
super sweet
um but then we have to search really
hard and we don't really know which
questions you guys
really want answered so because you know
there's no guarantee your question is
going to get answered you could get zero
up votes
so at least make your own question if
you're gonna and then
upload the questions you really want
answered so that way when you
we get to the next webinar because you
know we just look at the comments and
that's how we
get all the questions going um then we
can have more of the questions you want
answered because it's like look
if a bunch of the uploads are like one
and two and zero we're just going to
start doing zero outflow questions if
you're like oh why are you spending an
hour talking about this guy's
like well if you guys
see some questions like i'm curious
about that i'll build them shits and
we'll have a better time
absolutely all right folks we're gonna
wrap this one up uh we'll see you
in two weeks for another q a with a new
thumbnail we're back
no more alright folks thanks again
we'll see you next time
