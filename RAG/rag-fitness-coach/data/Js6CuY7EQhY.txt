hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
how do you train on a bulk versus a cut
what are the differences before we get
into that let's talk about
quick reminder of some training
universals in a bunch of our other
videos
if you scroll through our channel's
history attend to all these much more
specifically so i'll just speak
about them super super quick pretty much
always no matter the phase you train
with great technique
duh i'm not going to explain why you
want to train with higher stimulus to
fatigue ratio exercises
exercises that really really mess up
your target muscles
aren't super difficult to do emotionally
like rack deadlifts or something
uh and don't mess up your joints a lot
so those are always a really good idea
exercises you feel in the muscles versus
the joints
rep ranges that give you the highest sfr
so if you have like
you know pec flies if you do them for
sets of five to ten you're like i just
kind of hurts my shoulders do you prefer
to 10 to 15 you're like wow this really
messes up my pecs
it's probably better to do pack flies
like that kind of no matter what phase
you're in
so you always want the rep ranges to be
mostly determined by stimulus to fatigue
ratio
not anything else we say and we will say
some other stuff that should just bias
it a little bit
one way or the other sfr at the end of
the day is the predominant reason you
choose your rep ranges as you do
with a per muscle group frequency of at
least
twice per week all right
what that means is if you want a real
best effort trying to
grow your pecs as big as possible or not
lose any pack size on a fat loss plan no
matter which one you do
you should be training your packs at
least twice a week maybe as many as four
times per week
to the end of total frequency and this
is a
kind of an understatement but i think it
bears mention if you make a serious
attempt at
muscle gain a real serious attempt at
fat loss while you retain muscle
you probably want to train at least four
total sessions per week
okay does that mean you get no results
with three total sessions no you get
great results
but like like you're not winning the mr
olympia resistance training three times
a week
and you're not gonna take your genetic
abilities your environmental abilities
like how much food you're eating how
much rest you're getting
and maximize them with three days a week
with four days
that's a that's a good solid effort true
high level
bodybuilders probably need to be
training five or six times
a week and even more perhaps with two a
day sessions in my view
but like i'll put you this way if you
are really struggling with putting on
mass
and i find out you lift twice a week or
three times a week one of my first
things i'll say to you is like you
should probably lift like four times a
week
at least right give four times a week a
shot and you'll probably have much
better results
right um another point that always holds
you want to train about three to zero
reps
from failure reps in reserve so if
you're training with six reps in reserve
it's too easy
if you're always grinding beyond failure
it's probably too hard and too much
fatigue for the stimulus you get
so between three and zero rrr always
holds and from your minimum effective
volume to your maximum recoverable
if you're training mostly at your
maximum recoverable you're probably
wasting your time quite a bit
training mostly at your minimum
effective you're probably wasting your
time quite a bit too so that really
productive middle ground
probably throughout that whole middle
ground is just good practice for any
phase
that being said let's get into some
special circumstances
on a cut so being that you start with
normal training
how do we change that training slightly
and it is slightly it's not completely
different
to make sure that we're getting as much
out of the cut as possible
first do not specialize there's no such
thing as a pec
priority cutting phase why because if
you do
more pecs and you have a certain
systemic mrv you have to do less of
something else
like less forearms or less biceps
because there's only so much fatigue you
can sum up
interestingly enough on a cut that
systemic mrv
impinges much more because your ability
to clear fatigue
is lower on a cut less food and you're
some fatigue more highly because of all
the cardio and other things that you're
doing
so that's even more of a concern what
you want to do is you want to spread
your volume as evenly as possible
around to all of the muscles that you
want to save to have
to be their same size or close at the
end of a cut so instead of doing way
more chest
and way less biceps if you do that we'll
talk about what happens
to your chest in just a sec but you may
lose some bicep size
and that's not great the number one goal
of a cut
as far as resistance training is
conserving all the muscle that you have
which means you need to spread your
volume pretty evenly or at least attend
to all the minimum effective volumes of
every single muscle group
now you may say okay yeah i'll lose my
biceps a bit but my pecs will get huge
bullshit on a cut you don't have the
resources the food the rest so on and so
forth
to maximize muscle hypertrophy for a
specific muscle
if you're not a beginner or early
intermediate the best you can hope for
is that you lose no muscle on a cut you
don't hope for growth on a cup that
tends to be either very small in
magnitude or relatively rare
so if you're intermediate or advanced
you're blasting your pecs like crazy on
a cut
we already know that that's taking away
volume and systemic fatigue from other
muscles that could be shrinking on you
but what is it doing for your pecs
probably a whole lot of nothing because
there's just not enough food
to get your pecs to grow there's not
that hypercaloric environment
which for advanced folks is almost
necessary for them to make progress
if you're going to specialize hit wink
wink
that's for the next slide that's uh what
to do on a bulk
okay so specializing in cut outside of
really
specific circumstances like the judges
said you need to bring in bigger lats in
your shows in eight weeks
something like that other than that not
a good idea
point number two you want to err on
slightly higher frequencies
lower frequencies can be very anabolic
that is you can train
once every week make a huge muscle gain
and then because
you're on a bulk you there's enough food
and stuff like that floating around
hormonally you just don't lose any
muscle that whole week so you gain a
bunch first half of the week and then it
stays
the same and then you hit it again and
you gain again that's totally fine
in a cutting phase there's a sort of
like
pervasive net catabolic environment so
when your muscles stop
gaining they kind of start losing so
what you want to do and that's relative
gaining and they're gaining and losing
at the same time which basically means
their flatline
for that reason slightly higher
frequencies are probably better when
cutting
so if you normally train your legs once
a week on a mass
that may actually are in bulk whatever
terminology you want to use that's
probably okay
and if it's working for you great when
you start cutting i would switch to at
least twice a week for legs
because if you train your legs on monday
by the weekend on a cut you'd be losing
a little bit of quad size first couple
weeks you won't be able to tell
last couple weeks like fuck man my legs
just aren't what they used to be
i'm losing some poundage on the lips
they look a little flat and that's
because
you may not have been training them at
least twice a week so air a little bit
on the higher frequency side
number three you want to choose
exercises that are more attentive to the
stimulus to fatigue ratio the sfr
and a little bit less attentive to raw
stimulus magnitude rsm now raw stimulus
magnitude
is how much just fucking growth an
exercise causes
uh regardless of how much fatigue it
causes the deadlift is a perfect example
will the deadlift give you a big fucking
back fuck yes it will it'll smash your
back
into size but on a cut your total
fatigue allotment is lower
because the cut is so fatiguing and it
allows you to dump so little fatigue
over the course of training
because fatigue is way more constraining
we want to make sure the exercises we
use
really justify their fatigue with a high
relative amount of stimulus so high sfr
moves
maybe like barbell bent rows maybe like
stiff legged deadlifts
and not as many high raw stimulus
magnitude moves like deadlifts now you
may retort intelligently
that look like i'm on a fucking bigger
back i got to use the biggest weapons
totally but not during a cut because you
don't grow back during a cut you grow
that on a bulk
right so higher sfr moves are more
prized than usual because they're always
prized
but in put it another way the high
roster most magnitude moves we might not
want to use them as much
if they come with a big fatigue cost but
you can't fucking afford to pay it
plain and simple right
number four you may want to err slightly
on the side of higher reps
just a little bit just take all your
every option bump by five something like
that
not in north of 30 right so if your
average reps are already 30
don't go north of that but if your
average reps are like let's say five on
some exercise maybe go to 10 or
something like that maybe even a couple
go to eight
why it takes a lot of psychological
energy
to get yourself to doing really big
lifts that are really heavy
probably disproportionately more energy
than you get
a hypertrophy effect out of that versus
higher reps
so if you do a set of five in the squat
you could get real robust hypertrophy
it's fucking pretty tough a set of
tennis squad also very tough but
probably nets you a little bit more
hypertrophy than a set of five
it's difficult to detect a lot of bad
analyses but there's probably something
there
over time that stuff adds up and the
thing is normally that's not a problem
normally you just do whatever's best for
growth but on a cut you have so little
psychological energy to begin with
maybe it's easier to grind through
higher reps
than it is to get a real big effort
going and get your biggest possible
lifts
in addition to that a lot of the times
your leverages on a cutting phase
will start to disproportionately be less
favorable towards big strength lifts
and then higher reps may actually be a
way for you to continue to progress at
least psychologically it looks nice to
be getting stronger not losing strength
whereas if you did very low rep stuff
you may actually lose some strength and
it's not you're losing underlying
strength your range of motion is
increasing
and maybe that's uh something that uh
you know psychologically is especially
really tough to deal with like fuck i'm
getting weaker what the hell am i doing
here at all
during the course of a cut on average
your fibers tend to convert from more
fast reach activity to slightly more
slow twitch activity
and because you're losing body fat your
endurance is going up as well
from that line so actually
by doing slightly higher repetitions and
potentially adding reps instead of
adding load in some weeks
you can continue to escalate your
performance or at least maintain it
better
with higher reps on a cut than on a mass
and we'll come back to this on the
bulking stuff
where the reverse may actually be true
for bulking so just biasing your ups a
little bit higher on a cut is probably a
good idea funny enough
bodybuilders have been doing this for
generations anyway but they make
bullshit reasons that aren't actually
true to justify the shit that's actually
much more humbling
okay bodybuilders you know coming up
close to a
a contest or something or the end of
their fat loss phase will say i'm
fucking doing high reps to etch in the
details what the fuck does that even
mean you know fucking razor blade doing
this shit to your quads no this
thing is etching details however the
real reason they're doing higher reps
is because lifting heavy is just no
longer as impressive because they can't
lift as heavy where the progress they
used to see is much lower
there is some argument for injury risk
there a little bit
so maybe that's a part of it but they
just don't have the energy for big
strength lifts and they're not as strong
as they used to be or they're not
gaining strength as
fast as they used to be so they kind of
just pivot like i'll do higher reps and
it turns out because the fiber
conversion and the lower body fat
they can do reps really really well
they're like wow this is fucking awesome
i'm getting a ton out of this and yeah
sure
that works as far as it goes it doesn't
mean you're etching in details but it
still may be a slightly better strategy
none of this is dogma by the way if you
have great cuts doing low reps fucking
keep doing it
but if you get in the situation where
half with your cut your strength lifts
start to like not look so good
but your high rep stuff looks excellent
and it feels great
do a little bit more of that and i
promise you can get all of your rep
strength back
after you're done coming no problem no
matter what rep range is you just start
training in and voila it comes right
back
number five expect your minimum
effective volume to be slightly higher
duh it makes sense there's a huge
catabolic impetus all the time
you need to do a little bit more work to
get that minimum effect of volume
because it has more catabolism to fight
against remember muscle growth
is when anabolism exceeds catabolism
slightly and muscle maintenance is when
they're tied
okay if catabolism is higher than usual
your mev used to be here it's not
anymore minimum effective volume is now
here whatever just exceeds
that barrier so that means on a cutting
phase
when you start your mesocycle you may
start with like four or five sets
per muscle group per session as opposed
to three or four and you'll actually be
able to tell us in your training
it'll take you longer to get a pump like
it'll in and
especially later into the cut
interestingly enough one of our metrics
for when you hit
start a mev is you start to really
fatigue that local muscle
performance starts to go down deep into
a cut you actually can do a lot of sets
of the same or really close reps over
and over and over because your endurance
is so good
your muscles are so slow twitch the
problem is they're not as likely to be
stimulated for hypertrophy so you have
to do more sets to get that rep drop off
more sets to get the pump
and all of a sudden uh it takes you know
just a little bit more for that minimum
effective volume i think okay i can
train more ah but hold down the sad
fucking irony of cutting
point number six your mrv will be lower
your maximum recovery volume
has to be lower because the recovery is
highly mediated
by your nutritional environment in your
traditional environments pure fucking
dog shit and also you're doing cardio on
top of that also cutting a stressful
so the most sets you can do per session
and still benefit probably falls as well
now if you're looking at it this way
during massing your minimum effective
volume is here maximum recoverable is
here
that means you have a broad range of
training and you can go from your mev
and take a long time or jump up in big
increments of load
or reps and sets to get to your mrv no
big deal
when you're cutting and i'm sure you
guys have experienced this before this
window narrows quite a bit
so that you have to start with a little
bit more training than normally you
would
and inch up slowly slowly slowly
maybe add a rep every other session
maybe two and a half pounds on the bar
every session
as opposed to every five if you're
actually going to have
metal cycles of a decent length because
if you're used to massing you're like
fuck when i leg press on mass
i add 15 pounds to the machine every
time and i still hit all my reps
that may last you two weeks on a cut and
then all of a sudden you underperform
the fuck am i done like am i deloading
after two weeks that's crazy
the next point will show you how crazy
it is you don't want to deload that
frequently you want to have a nice long
accumulation phase
or a cut with nice long accumulation
phases in it so you're gonna
know that your mev is higher mrv is
lower that means
the repetitions you add the load you add
and even the sets you add are going to
be slower
to sort of dope out that longer run
that's a good thing
number seven last one for these cutting
recommendations
your d-load must be you caloric your
d-load
has to be at maintenance calories
because that's what's going to let you
recover the
only purpose of your d-load is to drop
the fatigue to prepare you for another
mesocycle of training
and to conserve muscle while doing so
if you are still hypocaloric during
d-load if you're still cutting during a
deload
how the fuck are either one of those two
going to happen you're not recovering
shit because you're still starving to
death
and you're hypocaloric at a time when
you're barely training at all you're
going to start to lose muscle now you're
not going to lose a ton of muscle
but you're going to lose some and much
worse you're not gonna drop that fatigue
i know we deal it every oh four to eight
weeks i know it's weird to take a diet
break every four to eight weeks but
that's what has to happen
for the best possible results so give
that some thought
all right
lastly special circumstances
taking your normal training and changing
it a little bit on a bulk on a mass i
always like mass people say bulk all the
time
we're gonna see how bulk looks for the
youtube algorithm
number one consider specializing we know
that especially for intermediate and
advanced individuals
their sum total of muscle group mrvs is
higher than their systemic total mv like
if you train everything balls out from
its local mbv to mrv
each muscle to its fullest abilities you
are just going to run out of fatigue
room and not be able to train everything
so that happens for advanced folks
specialization is a really good idea
take half of your body and put it on the
back burner maintenance volume
for half your body let's say your chest
and your back and your hamstrings
go to maintenance volume and then your
arms and your shoulders
your quads and calves go on full blast
mvv to mrv which is by definition
specialization
really good idea on massing because not
only
is the best way to grow when you're
advanced but also you have the resources
to grow remember we said it was stupid
on cutting because there's nowhere
where are we growing from right that's
like um a stupid analogy but it's like
being in
uh you know wartime restricted rations
and there's not enough steel to go
around and you're like it's time to
build a skyscraper even bigger like what
the fuck are you talking about there's
no steel
but when it's economic good times
bulking then there's plenty of steel and
you have the resources to do it and
voila it's time
it's time to make that happen right
point number two
you want to consider not necessarily
accept still
stimulus to fatigue ratio is king but
you want to consider high raw stimulus
magnitude moves
moves that may cost you exercises that
may cost you a ton of fatigue
but they grow so much muscle because
that's kind of the whole point of a bulk
it might be worth the trade-off it's not
something you do all the time
but fatigue is less of a concern here
because first of all a ton of food
mitigates a shitload of fatigue
and second of all if you choose only the
most stimulus to fatigue
high exercises the raw stimulus
magnitude may not be high enough for
those to really power
as much growth as you would so when is
it time to do fucking reps of deadlifts
to get a big back
bulking now that fucking sucks because
deadlift and bulking at the same time
blows
but it will add slabs of beef absolutely
100
a lot of folks kind of intuitively knew
this in bodybuilding bulking is when
they would start to use
big compound heavy exercises now it's
time to get strong bulking season
that help doesn't have a lot to do with
strength but absolutely high raw
stimulus magnitudes
are just more possible then and also
beneficial because they grow so much
muscle and the fatigue is not nearly as
big of a
concern as it is on a cutting phase
number three
minimum effective volume may be slightly
lower than on maintenance
okay than normal that means after just a
couple sets of curls you got a fucking
gnarly pump
and you're like no way two sets of curls
bullshit i need to do four i usually do
four
you do four and your biceps get sore for
like a week and a half you're like what
the fuck happened
well when you throw a ton of food and a
ton of rest in a system as is
typical in bulking the adaptive
processes are just better
and you have to do less to grow muscle
now
point number four is mrv is going to be
higher because the same
food and relaxation that you're throwing
at the muscles
that makes them so sensitive they grow
from less
makes them able to survive more how the
fuck do we square those two
what does that mean well that means
bulking and cutting
average volume and intensity is actually
going to be
roughly the same but in bulking properly
you can start lower easier gains
with fewer set numbers and
slowly over the course of the bulk over
the course of each meso rise to higher
mrvs or
instead of rising to as high of an mrv
come up to the same mrv
but do it several weeks later so that
you have more bulk
to actually get really really good
growth so
here's what i mean on a cut you may be
able to put 10 pounds on the leg press
twice
until you need to deload on a bulk you
may be able to put 10 pounds on a leg
press five times
five distinct session because your mev
and mrv is so far apart it takes a lot
of fatigue to rise from one to the other
and within that five times fuck man you
gained a shitload of muscle
it also means you may start instead of
your week of back training have an
average
of 10 sets you may start productively
with an average of eight sets
and instead of stopping at 16 sets you
may stop at 18 sets
both of those are fucking sweet because
both on the top end of your bulk
and the bottom end or top end of your
mesocycle and bottom end
you've slapped on more growth promoting
time
right and it doesn't matter if you add
faster
or you add that the same speed but go
for longer either way that results in
better gains
so give that some thought a lot of
people say oh man
i'm bulking i gotta do more no no you
will eventually do more
start with less and you get the best of
both possible worlds
number five delude should be eu caloric
again same idea now
the first several days after you've
finished your accumulation phase
you're still sore recovering and growing
a ton you can smash food
hyper caloric for the first couple of
days but in the last couple of days
if you keep it really hypercaloric you
just feel a little sluggish and you gain
a bit of extra fat and you're like man
but if you go back to your eucaloric
state as much energy
intake as it takes to maintain your body
systems then you know you feel better
and you're ready to eat more when the
masking starts and it attends to
everything that you need
so not a huge modifier there number six
consider lower repetition ranges
especially towards the end of your bulk
why this is a bit counterintuitive
when you get fatter okay higher
reps start to disproportionately suck
especially for what we call postural
compounds
squats deadlifts bent over rows
standing barbell presses you have to
maintain your posture
while doing reps you guys know when
you've balked before
your spinal erectors at some point like
fuck this
i'm out they cut that cord and your
stiff legged deadlift attempt
for sets of 12 goes nowhere because by
set number or rep number six
your lower back starts to round it's
fried you can't feel your hands like
dude fuck this
a bulk powered primarily by slightly
lower repetitions
doesn't run into that problem because if
you can't do sets of six
you're just too fat you're not bulking
you're not bodybuilder just fat piece of
shit
i've been there okay don't do that but
if you can do sets of five to ten
since the 10 to 15 versus if you
normally do a little higher reps
these can allow you especially towards
the end of your bulk when you're getting
a little bit fatter
to not have to worry about the endurance
component limiting you as much and you
can actually put in high quality work
and hey bonus round
your leverages are fucking baller shit
for being strong as fuck
so not only do you get high quality
training that's not limited by your
endurance capacity
but dude you're fucking strong and it's
easy to get motivated and be like yeah
i'm doing squats for sets of six to
eight but holy fuck am i squatting a lot
for sets of six to eight so it's kind of
the mirror image of what you would do on
a cut
again no dogma some of these work most
of these work for most people some won't
work for you give it some thought
and try marginally a little bit
implementing
these slight movements into your next
bulk into your next cut
let me know how you do and if it doesn't
work you get a
100 money back guarantee since you don't
fucking pay anything
you get zero back jk love you guys see
you next time
you
