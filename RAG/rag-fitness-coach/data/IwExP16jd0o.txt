no you don't have to worry about acute
injuries from locking out if you don't
have a congenital joint laxity disorder
which you probably don't if you're using
an appropriate load you can actually
handle through a full range of motion
and if you're not snapping into the
lockout in a velocity you're not used to
you're not well controlling the weight
and you're just doing it with Reckless
abandon if you're locking out at a
normal speed or one which you're used to
which could appear quite fast to the
naked eye then you're totally fine and
the people that get hurt in the gym
through locking out have almost always
gone unbelievably out of their way to
something so morally stupid that I don't
know I don't want to say they had it
coming but they had it coming
