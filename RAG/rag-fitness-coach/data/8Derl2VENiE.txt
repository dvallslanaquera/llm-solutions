hey folks dr mike here with renaissance
purization today's topic is alcohol and
fat loss
how compatible are they
can you still be a booze hound
and get shredded af as the kids on tick
tock say
tech talks good enough for me
so
yes let's get fucked up
but let us mind that there are at least
six
interesting interplays with alcohol and
fat loss dieting that are
generally speaking not amazing
so here we go
first of all alcohol literally prevents
much fat burning from occurring because
your body prefers to use alcohol for
energy before stored body fat in most
cases as long as you're putting the
booze down the hatch you could be
dancing the night away and you're just
burning off the alcohol it sucks i know
and it's a little bit more complicated
than that but not that much so alcohol
does directly blunt fat burning but
eating anything does so you could count
it as that
second
in many drinks alcohol is co-ingested
with sugar including all beer
but also frilly girly mixed drinks my
ties and shit like that scott is my tie
a fully girly mixed drink
sex on the beach
yes they never tell you about the sand
and its interaction with mucous
membranes oh and there's a drink too and
uh what's the big one the margarita
yeah if you get a huge margarita it's
not diet it's like a thousand calories
of like pure sugar it's pretty fucking
insane so a lot of times people say like
oh my god all this drinking is making me
fat and it's like yeah the wine beer and
margaritas are making you fat
alcohol may be playing a smaller role
still plays a role
point number three
alcohol especially consumed prior to
going to bed
disturbs uh sleep like a fuck load it
radically degrades the quality of your
sleep and high quality sleep is a huge
boon to fat burning so if you get shitty
sleep or not enough sleep which alcohol
actually engineers both outcomes in most
people
then it's really terrible for fat loss
so another knock on alcohol that really
sucks
hormonal effects it turns out that in
many cases alcohol actually allows you
to liberate more fat for
mobilization to where it would be burned
but in many cases if you continue to
consume alcohol in the acute period when
fat mobilization by alcohol has occurred
a lot of alcohol actually goes to your
liver
that sucks
because then you
can develop in extreme cases fatty liver
disease which is actually a subtype
called alcoholic fatty liver disease
that's how it happens so yeah
unfortunately the hormonal effects are
just not that great right
um
alcohol also
has an effect on human psychology
which is far and away the number one
reason why it's quite or i'll put it
better difficult to be compatible with
fat loss and here it is point number
five is that alcohol greatly potentiates
binging binge eating not in all people
but in many fucking people it is easily
the biggest culprit for faking and
alcohol because a lot of times when
people say oh my god like i drink so
often and i'm just like can't be lean
because of it it's like yeah maybe but
what do you do after you're drunk and
they're like well after i'm done getting
punched in the face by a bouncer i
usually like to go to my local
shitty grease hole and get like order of
fish sticks and dip them in gravy and
cheese what the fuck are we in canada
might as well be yeah it's tough people
eat like total dog shit and food tastes
some combination of like nothing at all
and incredible when you're drunk
it's tough and there's a social thing
everyone's going out to eat after
um
there's a thing where
alcohol literally
in most cases reduces your inhibitions
and then you know
when you're at a fat loss phase you have
to use technically psychologically as
some inhibitory drive to suppress your
your hunger and cravings but if the
inhibitions fly off like well alcohol is
cool for that reason because then you
can try to talk to people you wouldn't
normally solicit sex offer up sex of
your own which is fun in a club scene
but also you know when tasty food is in
front of your face you're like yeah you
just grab it like a child not exactly
conducive to dieting and tough to get
over
lastly the last ding on alcohol's
ability to comport with fat loss is that
it interferes with your next day
of kind of anything you planned
training is going to blow a little bit
more or potentially more dick the next
day
your neat can be down non-exercise
activity thermogenesis the amount you
just move around anyway like if you had
a fucking banger last night
you might be you know 2 p.m rolls around
you're still on your couch like
the fuck happened to me like you're not
getting a whole lot of steps in not
super conducive to fat burning and you
walk outside and the lady's been walking
her golden retriever around the block
ten times she's like hey how are you
like fuck people are awake at this hour
like that's not exactly a fat burning
lifestyle and then of course recovery
like you shitty night of sleep alcohol
interferes with recovery at almost every
level and if you are trying to lose fat
recovery is important because this is
your lifeline to keep diet fatigue in
check for as long as you need to be
dieting if you fuck with your recovery
you may find yourself in a very high
diet fatigue situation much sooner than
you thought which of course you need to
recalculate take a maintenance phase
blah blah not conducive for fat loss so
my best advice is
just don't fucking drink alcohol if you
want to lose fat now hold on a sec i'm
not gonna leave you motherfuckers just
that
hold up what if you just like um still
want to like drink
yeah
here is how you can drink oh my god how
many points do i have here seven even
more points on that than the points of
alcohol's detriment
seven points on how to if you're gonna
drink alcohol maybe a few times during
your fat loss phase if you can't avoid
it
then or if you just want a balanced life
where you get fucked up every now and
again but more slowly approach fat loss
here are some strategies to align your
drinking in such a way that makes it
more concordant or rather less
discordant with the fat loss process
do these as well as you can and as well
as you're willing to make the trade-off
some of them just categorically a good
idea some of them are like if you want
to zig this way or zag that way dealer's
choice so here they are first
sticks to stick to straight liquors
um no mixers i would avoid wine and beer
because if the straight liquors are what
you're going for in many cases the only
caloric content of that liquor is
alcohol so your calories ratio to how
fucked up you get is maximum
now
no mixture is this great but diet
mixtures work too so if you like order a
diet coke and scott you drink what do
people order
diet coke and
rum and coke ramen diet coke is
definitely a thing that's a perfectly
fine idea right almost all the calories
from the rum come from the alcohol or
all as far as i know and then you know
the rest is just like um you know just
liquid so it's totally good to go which
you do want to really avoid is like
margaritas and super shit like that
because that can just be like oh there's
120 grams of carbs in this drink what
the fuck am i eating kids cereal and
they're like oh yeah by the way you'll
get enough alcohol in there to get you a
slight buzz like there must be better
ways of doing this so if you're really
intending on getting a little fucked up
then yeah straight liquors etc point
number one and point number two don't
gel very well and i'll have some very
good caveats for you once i tell you
point number two is to drink on an
emptier stomach
why
because drinking on an emptier stomach
allows you to get substantially more
drunk or feel the effects of alcohol
more which is why you're drinking
alcohol
uh then if you drink on a full stomach
okay and that's just a thing
so if you're going to go to the club and
you want to be like partying with your
girlfriends and you want to be feeling
the music so to speak
being drunk
i just wouldn't eat like five burritos
before and be like i've had six drinks
nothing's fucking working like
and it won't for some time
so
empty your stomach is a good idea if you
want a small amount of calorically
impactful and otherwise negative for
your body alcohol to have the biggest
effect on your mood or whatever it is
you know when you're getting tipsy
here's the thing you must be very
careful with this i joke all the time in
this channel it's all for entertainment
etc
but you will fucking die if you fuck
this up people die all the time from
alcohol poisoning and it's a fucking
shitty thing so remember
that because you're on a fat loss phase
this adds to the mix by the way because
you probably haven't drank in a while
because you were doing straight liquors
in the system and because you were
drinking on an emptier than usual
stomach
prepare to not have to drink as much to
get fucking rocket rided up into
uh being super fucked up if you're like
oh yeah i normally have eight shots no
big deal and you take all eight at the
same time they'll see the hospital if
not the fucking morgue don't do anything
stupid set yourself up like this and
then start getting to the drinks in a
calm and steady manner which brings me
to point number three
this may sound pedantic to you my
apologies it was not meant this way but
i was younger once and i made all these
fucking mistakes so hopefully if you're
younger and you're watching this maybe
you don't have to check this out
have as few drinks
as gets the job done
as gets you to that fun alcohol driven
place that we all want to go to when
we're clubbing on a saturday night it's
a real place
mentally
socially
as far as mood and interaction go as far
as your abilities go
there is a place where you want to be
which i term in the mix
right that's there's a rank system for
this so i gave you a bunch of clues here
so
if you start drinking first drink half
drink if you're a real lightweight you
are feeling it okay so that's how you
drink it with someone you're like hey
what do you think like i'm feeling it
like that means you can tell you're
feeling the effects of alcohol but
you're not going to go clubbing the
night away if you're just feeling it
the next one is tipsy in my in my
totally random categorization tipsy's
like oh i'm like really feeling the
effect and it's it's doing something but
like tipsy is usually a thing people say
when you ask them if they're drunk and
they say no no i'm not drunk i'm tipsy
great that's fine but you're on your way
up the third state is where we want to
get to and ideally stay as long as
possible is what i call in the mix you
have maximum fun your groove and you're
jiving your inhibitions are lowered your
social sense is elevated you are still
able to connect words together to make
sentences and you're having fun and
you're fully aware and you're not at
medical risk of death
great place to be
if you continue to drink too much you
become drunk which is like can be a fun
time it can also be not a fun time right
you don't know where you are you lost
your keys you broke up with your
girlfriend by accident you got back
together with your grandma same five
minute phone call oops and that's not
great
next point you get to is sloppy that's
when other people around you are like
god damn it jim again
fuck we're gonna have to take this idiot
home
please don't throw up on that girl she's
trying to hit on you oh there's vomit on
her dress good job jim you fucked us all
nobody wants the thing is
you only ever want to be in the mix
that's where you're trying to go with
getting drunk
contradiction in terms but uh a lot of
times people overshoot and end up going
to sloppy because they make a big
assumption which i'm going to talk about
just a sec let's finish out this little
little board game here we have uh after
sloppy is college night
that's when people i think trying to
commit suicide with alcohol and most of
them luckily failing and then the last
one after that is hospital like you have
to be pulled out of the club at a
fucking stretcher they have to pump your
stomach and all that other stuff
here's where a lot of the stuff comes
from not all of it but a lot of this
comes from this
people assume that fun and alcohol or
his linear relationship the more shots i
have the more fun i have bullshit it's
curvilinear with a very very pronounced
peak
and that occurs when you are
in the mix
right
so if you were an inexperienced drinker
continue to drink intelligently so that
you know how many drinks it takes you
for this to happen or how you feel in
your own head for like
i know i'm good here and if my friends
are like shots again you'll be like oh
yeah let me wait another 30 minutes or
an hour and then you're fucking golden
because you're doping it out and you
keep being this level of drunk that is
just a great time
what you don't want to do is be like i'm
having so much fun right now in the mix
after three shots i should for sure have
five shots because then i'll be the i'll
be the most popular person of all time
and i'll just be able to shoot sex at
people closed in fact and you get there
you're like
yeah
and the girl's like what the fuck are
you gonna die
and you throw up everywhere and she's
like oh my god
nothing anyone wants so just remember
points one and two will take you faster
up the scale than you may be used to
going
take your time and the big thing here is
once you get to the place you want to be
with your night
spread the drinks out have a drink have
a non-alcoholic drink like you know a
diet coke or something have another
alcoholic drink
stay where you are don't just go
overboard
good thing about this is that it doesn't
take a ton of alcohol to get you feeling
your best that means you don't have to
expend a ton of calories affect your
sleep as much etc etc to be really in
the in the mix of the night where
everyone's having the most fun hopefully
you're one of those people
so just remember that because a lot of
people say well i want to drink when i'm
on fat loss phase it means i can't drink
that much well good you stupid
motherfucker you shouldn't be drinking
that much because most of the thing
after five or six shots for the average
person is an illusion you think there's
unicorns there but really it's just you
throwing up by a 7-eleven and the cops
are like sir go home
point number four
in this journey to make alcohol a little
bit more um
less deleterious to do the fat loss
phase is to be reasonably active
right uh if you're really on a fat loss
phase and you really don't want this
night to quote unquote set you back
then like dance motherfucker yeah god
damn it there's music on for a reason
dance remember uh just for you folks
with you know insufficient amount of
self-confidence you can dance anywhere
at all times and nobody can do a fucking
thing about it if you have enough balls
to dance you've got enough balls to do
all the kind of shit people notice i
happen to be an expert dancer i'm
actually world class i don't let me
compete at the worlds anymore
doping misunderstanding but i'm the best
so
yeah of course i'd say that but you guys
already know i'm the best at a ton of
shit um if you're not the dancing type
fine i'm also not i have no coordination
whatsoever you can at least work the
room like don't just sit there and take
shots and sit there get up walk around
talk to people
if there's any aliens or lizard people
talk to them be like so what's up what's
next for the world how is joe biden
doing seriously how's he doing i'm
concerned
point number five
this is a fucking big one and folks
i'mma be real with you
this is heart
do not binge eat afterwards
fuck
good news is if you did point number
three correctly
and you topped out at being in the mix
and not super fucked up you'll be able
to have a higher chance of being like
you know what fellas i'm gonna skip
going to
long john silver's how's that for a
post-drinking spot scott don't throw up
um
long john silver's is a no for me fellas
i'm gonna go home and eat my uh clean
meal that i made it sucks to even say
or maybe you're at the club and girls
are talking to you so you don't want to
leave and you're like hold on ladies and
you pull out a protein bar and you pull
it back and hey you might strike a
check a great conversation because the
two girls you were talking to are like
oh my god what a weirdo i don't know a
third fit chick comes up and she's like
oh
what like random protein bar is that and
you're like um it's pure protein it's
really good it's the peanut butter
chocolate chip one and she's like can i
like see your protein bar and you're
like yeah right here she's like i don't
mean that one and you're like finally
fit chicks i knew it was the protein bar
as it was going
bring these bitches in in any case
it's tough to do you can bring your
protein bars to the club that's fucking
weird but it works you can have a meal
or a shake made for when you show up and
you look at your fridge like this and
everything's spinning you're like oh
yeah clean meal clean food doesn't even
fucking taste that good of your drink to
be honest but if you really want to make
an impact on your fat loss don't fucking
go to taco bell afterwards because all
that shit is a wash
if
you have to go to a food cart or some
shit
just try a couple things you like eat
someone's breaded shrimp one shrimp and
let me get a bite of your burger shut up
boom it's happening it's over stay calm
your burger's fine minus my bite and
then you're fucking good like if you can
do that great because people just want
to graze and feel the float and you
stuff themselves fine but the less
damage you can do here the better and
this is the biggest culprit and the
biggest one to fight it's really hard
here's another one
stop drinking two or more hours before
you hit the sack that'll encourage more
of your sleep to be of higher quality it
is really hard to do
if you're in the mix and you never get
super fucked up you can actually pull it
off because at some point you realize
that you don't want to be hungover the
next day the party's about as good as
it's going to get it's actually on its
decline the number one worst thing you
can do then is drink even harder to try
to make the party more fun that never
works
what you want to do is back off the
drinking and just chill and talk with
your friends and then you're not so
drunk anymore and then you're pretty
sober and you walk home and you look at
your fridge you eat your clean meal you
watch a couple of you know episodes of
justice league or whatever if you're an
intelligent sane person that's what you
do at night and then you go to bed and
you wake up fucking fresh as a cucumber
as we say in russia and uh you run a
mile and punch rocky balboa in the face
all the same shit you did the day before
when you were on a fat loss diet so
you're good to go tough to do but if you
can pull it off it really really really
is worth it
and point number seven
not really much of a point but it's
valid don't drink super often uh save
most if not all of your drinking for
when you're not on a fat loss phase and
i know that sounds
itchy
i know that sounds weird to say because
it's like duh asshole that's fucking
implied but i think a lot of people have
trouble delaying gratification in the
sense of like when i'm in a fat loss
phase
or when you're in a fat loss phase you
have to understand that it's not a
permanent situation it's temporary and
you can be without drinking i sure hope
if you can't you need to go to a fucking
psychotherapist or a fucking addiction
counselor if you can go without drinking
for like the last eight weeks of your
fat loss phase
you're just gonna have a fucking great
time in your philosophies you're gonna
accomplish what it is you need to
accomplish and then once you're lean and
you're fucking off to you know go use
your new lean body for sex then alcohol
is back and it's great you don't even
have to do all the stupid bullshit i
just talked about
anyway be safe do anything stupid
uh and have fun god damn it that's an
order see you next time
you
