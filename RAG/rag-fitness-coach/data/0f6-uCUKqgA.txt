hey folks it's me dr mike welcome to the
targeting the muscle series
incline dumbbell presses to target the
upper chest how do we do them to get the
most out of them here we
go
[Music]
what
bench angle height
is optimal for hitting the clavicular
upper pectoralis
you will find at least one and i believe
at most one study actually examining
this
one study tells us almost nothing about
the real world just a little bit of a
clue but it found that a lower angle
somewhere between 10 and 30 degrees
actually targets the upper chest the
best but i'll give you guys a much
better trick than that
play around with a few different angles
and figure out works best for you it can
be a reality that if you
go and take the angle
one up from normal your upper pecs are
fried they're sore a day after they're
pumped everything's amazing it could
also be that you do this and for any
number of human anatomical differences
or technique differences that we'll
discuss in a bit you're actually just
feeling your mid and lower chest for the
most part in that case you can take it
up one
and then up one and an upward and up one
and see where it fits best the last
thing i'll say is variation is okay you
don't have to look for the optimal angle
you can do a few weeks of training a
mesocycle or so at a low incline see how
that feels do it at a high incline see
how that feels do it at a moderate
incline see how that feels and then all
three might be just different variations
of awesome and you can incorporate all
three in future training and get an
awesome variety and most importantly
gigantic upper packs
[Music]
if you're having trouble feeling your
upper chest and getting a good workout
out of inclined dumbbell presses one
place to look maybe hilariously not even
on the upper chest at all
i feel like a shitty marketing scammer
looking at what your feet are doing can
be important specifically are your feet
in a position that allows for a lot of
stability
so
for example
a not so wise idea would be to load up
the dumbbell press and keep your feet
dangling and then do some number of reps
and realize that when the movement gets
difficult
you start to
wobble back and forth and that is
terrible but why wouldn't you wobble
you're totally unstable
the best thing you can do is put your
feet down
whole foot into the ground
connected to the ground but connected to
the chair upper back connected to the
bench and now you are
unstoppable fright train of stability
and strength amazing if you're a short
king like me
it's totally fine to just put your toes
in as long as you feel stable but if you
have the option
whole foot is the best if you do that
you set up all the stability to generate
as much strength up towards the top of
the chain as possible and then big pecks
will be your eventuality even if you're
short like me hey maybe you'll still
even get laid a few times i haven't but
i'm trying
all right often for many chest exercises
the two really good cues to use
are to arch your back a little bit and
push your chest up and also to retract
your shoulder blades this pre-stretches
your pecs and keep your shoulders tight
tucked and nice and safe makes the chest
the real bonus of the movement however
if we were to do this
in incline dumbbell pressing
because we have retracted our shoulder
blades we're forced to press up and out
and that's weird and really
limits how much weight you can lift and
it's just super strange to do so i'm
going to do it for you guys let's see if
i get killed so
start here chest up that's good we don't
want to do this chest nice and up
but we don't want to retract our
shoulder blades a ton
because then we press
and then i can't actually press any more
than this without under attracting my
shoulder blades because i'm out of room
i would have to press out which is super
 weird so what you want to do is
chest up but actually relax your
shoulder blades and allow them to move
so that you can lock out fully
come down deep
and lock out fully just like that
because if we arch we can't lock out
anymore and that makes the movement
really really weird
[Music]
what we want out of this movement is to
hit the chest
one of the best ways to hit the chest is
to stretch it super super deep at the
bottom
if we touch the dumbbell to our chest we
actually limit the motion because the
dumbbells are often using bigger
dumbbells they're going to have an even
bigger
ratio of sort of handle to actual uh
plate size you're going to limit your
range of motion so for example if i'm
touching my chest with the dumbbells on
the bottom i can go to here and that's
cool not a big stretch for the packs
actually less of a stretch than with a
barbell but dumbbells can afford a
bigger stretch if you touch to the
outside of your shoulders so instead of
doing the dumbbell press like this and
touching your chest which limits the
range of motion and can let you use more
weight instead
touch to the outside of your shoulders
and you'll have to use less weight for
this but it works super well come out as
you go down and touch your side delts
and even your biceps if you can
all the way back out out and down and oh
my pecs i can feel it i'm gonna do a few
more reps just because it feels so
amazing and it feels like such a big
stretch especially if you slow that
descent
gently touch at the bottom and come all
the way up amazing pec work
here
yeah you're doing stuff
but it's more triceps less chest and if
you don't have a deep stretch in the
muscle that you're training
it's just not the same
[Music]
next tip and last tip
what should you do with your elbow angle
should you do the following
should you keep your elbows tucked in
and press like this maybe should you
keep your elbows super far out jared
feather style and press like that maybe
the real answer is where does it feel
like your chest is getting hit the most
the answer is usually somewhere in
between but where exactly in between is
up to you so try a bunch of things what
i like to do is just go in a natural
position that's just a little bit south
of elbows flared and that feels really
good for me it feels good on my elbows
feels good on my shoulder joints and it
feels good on my pecs no big deal if i
go here that feels fine but i don't get
a big tech stretch if i go here i get a
crazy pec stretch but also my shoulder
joints don't feel all that amazing so
it's really auto regulated it's really
up to you try a whole bunch whatever it
gets your pecs hit the hardest and feels
the best on your elbows and shoulders
that's probably the right answer and
there may not be one right answer but
many
all of those could feel good and then
you just built yourself a few more
variations you can do over the months
pepper in that that change and it's
awesome all the way around folks
thank you so much for tuning in see you
next time
