hey folks Dr Mike here for Renaissance
periodization and today's BS episode is
to claim that the idea that walking is
perfectly good exercise for everyone is
BS walking is not exercise
has it been 30 seconds yet I'll save the
BS for later
I had to get the Arnold BS in there so
I'll save it for the end of the episode
but
for now all I have to say is point
number one the issue is a little bit
nuanced I did oversell that walking is
not exercise so let's figure out how
walking can be exercised and for who and
for folks that are low in activity that
get fewer than 5 000 daily steps for
example on average if they start walking
especially at 10 000 or so or maybe 10
000 Plus
daily steps walking absolutely does
count as a type of very important
exercise they should be getting
it's great exercise it's easy to do
and it's a great way to ease into the
fitness thing for people that are way
out of shape or just completely out of
touch and fitness altogether absolutely
now for folks that are already
walking a lot and for those who are not
over fat or very overweight a lot of
older people especially
walking is just not hard enough
on the body it doesn't present enough of
a challenge to your physiology and your
Anatomy
for it to check all of the main Health
boxes we want exercise to check thus if
you are older in your 40s 50s 60s Plus
and you're walking plenty and you're not
over fat
you should be doing more
because it's actually inaccurate for
someone to say hey do you exercise
you're like oh yeah absolutely they're
like how you're like wow I walk a ton
but that's not enough to check all the
boxes walking is great exercise for
someone just easing into their Fitness
but for someone who wants the really
core elements of checking the boxes to
make sure you're doing everything you
can to be reasonably
fit in every capacity and healthy we
need a few more things and here they are
a holistic fitness program should
include plenty of Baseline walking
something like 10 000 steps a day on
average is great
in addition to that you should highly
consider doing regular higher intensity
cardio where you're breathing very heavy
for at least 30 minutes per session
something like three times per week and
you can do much more than that and get
even healthier but that's kind of the
minimum
and in addition to that not in a
trade-off with that
regular resistance training lifting
weights with machines dumbbells cables
whatever
at least whole body twice a week and
then more is better
after that
so if you're an older person if you're
new to Fitness if you have family and
friends hint that's why I made this one
that are saying look I walk a lot and my
diet is good I'm out of a weight I'm
good to go you can kindly direct them to
do at least two things one is have some
hard cardio where they really challenge
themselves regularly a few times a week
heavy breathing you know breathe heavy
when you walk I sure hope
and two some kind of resistance training
be it just two times a week builds bones
it builds muscle and it enhances your
health in a way that no number of just
daily steps can get you to
give that some thought because the idea
of it for everyone wanting their best
health walking is enough to count as all
the exercise you need is
as the great Arnold Schwarzenegger would
no doubt say no you can just
walk you've got to run and you've got
the bike and swim and yeah and yeah and
do the thing with the the arms they go
like this yeah it's called the the
elliptical yeah and it looks funny but
you're going to be a Superman yeah and
then you lift weights yeah in the gym
and you're coming all the time in any
case I've talked myself out I'll see you
next time
