hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
muscle gain dieting made simple video
number one
standardizing your intake we're going to
have i think 10 videos total here
very similar to our earlier series of
fat loss diet you made simple some
eerie similarities here but
if you watch this whole video series you
will sort of at a very fundamental level
understand the basics
of setting up a muscle gain diet and
executing it well so that all your heart
training in the gym is
really going to the right place by
giving you enough nutrients to actually
gain as much muscle as possible
super simple stuff here but even
sometimes super simple stuff
can be a little mysterious if you don't
zoom in on it so here's the deal
election number one is standardizing
your intake
you want a diet to gain muscle duh
that's why you're watching this video
and of course we're going to welcome you
in advance to club huge
where you can see i'm trying to get
anyway i think we all are you're never
really in that club you just think
you're on your way to it
and we're going to do things right
because look i've done a ton of things
wrong i'm sure you've done a ton of
things wrong
and in order to do things right step
number one is getting to know where
we're
at as far as our actual intake most
people when they start a diet they want
to plan
they want to tell me what to do but
before we tell you what to do in order
for that what to do part
to be specific to your goals and to your
conditions and to work the best
we have to make sure to figure out where
you're coming from right like
what's hard what's a lot of food for
someone is not a lot of food or someone
else
what's hard workout for someone is not
hard for someone else it depends on
where you're coming from so
our first priority is going to be to
figure out where you're at
by tracking macros regularly there are
many ways to do this
myfitnesspal is a great tool to do this
i would say the rp diet
coach app that we have is cool but it's
really not a tracker
it can work as a tracker not the best
tracker of all time it's a diet coach so
actually
towards the end of this video series
i'll tell you like when it's a good time
to download and use that if you're into
that sort of thing but for now free
version of myfitnesspal works great
if you're new to counting macros and
you're real confused about the whole
process and myfitnesspal looks like
you know matrix code to you you can give
some thought to
our healthy eating made simple series
watch those videos and then after you
watch those videos then tracking will
make a whole lot more sense even just a
few of those videos
on basic macros and stuff will would put
you really far along the way now
once you start tracking here's what
you're doing you're just eating
basically to hunger like you normally
eat whatever however you normally eat
and you track everything okay every meal
you track proteins carbs and fats
or at least for every day total so that
at the end of this process which is
going to last so a week or two of just
tracking and pretty much doing nothing
else
if you're more advanced you can skip to
some of the other stuff we'll talk about
in later videos but
for at least a little while you are
going to track protein carbs and fats
and you're going to know after one or
two weeks how much
average per day protein per day carbs
and per day fats you take in
that is super important because that's
going to serve as the foundation
of how we're going to construct your
diet and then how we're going to change
your diet to make sure you gain weight
appropriately and gain as much muscle as
possible
we have to know where you're coming from
and the best way to know where you're
coming from is to measure where you're
coming from
which is exactly what we're doing here
we could say hey like do this for a day
but look it could be a weird day you
went to the chinese buffet that day or
you studied really hard for an exam and
you're like i had a protein bar and
coffee today
that sucks guess my mass intake is going
to be 500 calories because i only had
200 today
that's not gonna work so a good week or
two average will give you a stable
baseline of like oh look i eat like 150
grams of protein 400 grams of carbs and
100 grams of fat per day
that we can work with and you're going
to take that number
you're going to bring it over next week
to video number two in which we'll
talk about choosing the actual foods
because right now you're sort of eating
whatever you want
in the next video we'll talk about okay
the foods that you're actually eating to
make those protein carbs and fats
let's talk about which foods probably
help muscle building over the long term
a little bit more than others
and choose more of those we'll see you
then next week for that next video peace
you
