hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
let's talk about determining your
hypertrophy volume not a theoretical
concept discussion in general but how
you go about determining how much volume
you need to maximize your muscle growth
and then adjusting it from there based
on how your body adapts
so we're going to talk about how to
establish
quality of training first to make sure
the volume you're doing is good
stuff not crap we're also going to talk
about frequency because it's always a
part of the discussion how often you
should be training each muscle group
per week then we're going to talk about
the benefits of starting
low on the low end of volumes because
there's tons more benefits than starting
on the high end
we're going to talk about normative
references which means just like you
know what what is everyone else doing
like where on
average should you start giving a
certain muscle group because you know
all this talk intellectually with auto
regulation can leave you really in the
dark to where to even guess
and then lastly we're going to talk
about probably the most powerful tool in
determining your own training volume
auto regulation that is doing something
detecting feedback from the body
and then adjusting it as your body
feedback gives you information to do so
so quality and frequency first
before you choose your per session
volume even go on this journey of
exploration you have to make sure
that each set because when we talk about
volume we're going to talk about number
of heart sets you do in your training
each set has to be of high quality what
does that mean we have a few videos
before this one that
address exactly that but just as a quick
review you have to have good technique
okay the sets should be in the 5 to 30
rep range like how many sets of one
do you need to do to grow who knows like
80 or something right how many sets of
50
well it's too light and all the sets are
crappy quality and then lastly so 5 to
30 reps per set and lastly
you know somewhere between three reps
away from failure or at failure or zero
ups from veil
uh so you know hard training right is if
you
uh do all of your sets like beyond
failure and someone helps you out and
you just crush it
then the amount of volume you're going
to do is much lower because a huge huge
fatigue in position you won't be able to
survive a
higher volume than that on the other
hand if you're training every set like
six reps away from failure you're gonna
be able to do a whole lot of sets and
actually not get much out of it
so your number of sets recommendation is
gonna go through the roof and it's just
really crappy work
really really poor efficiency so you
wanna make sure you're training with
good technique in the right rep range
and training hard
once that's the case we have to make
sure you choose our your frequency
correctly because if you
choose like a one time a week training
frequency that's so far away from what's
probably optimal for most people
that the volume recommendations are
going to get really kind of wonky and
then the
auto regulation at that training
frequency also has problems
because like a soreness is a very
different variable if you train once a
week you get really really sore and
can't use soreness as much as a of a
guide as you could
all this kind of stuff we don't want to
do and at the end of the day so
frequency is complicated and that's for
another discussion another time and i
promise you we're going to have tons and
tons of videos we already have a few
basic ones we're going to have tons of
advanced videos on frequency periodizing
frequency all this other crazy stuff
for now just make sure you're training
like two to four times per week per
muscle groups if you train legs train
them two three or four times a week
right arms chest back same thing and
that's a great range to start with know
a range that you can easily recover from
okay so like for example let's say
you've been
training chest twice a week and you want
to really like hone in on your volume
and you know you can recover from
training chest with reasonable volumes
that you've been doing twice a week
you're not like crushed all the time
don't like start this process and be
like i'm gonna go four times a week with
chest and then discover my volume you're
not used to it
it's not your universe yet start with
something you know you can recover from
in the two to four time a week range and
go from there don't train like once a
week
and for now until you're more advanced
until you really explore this
sort of space don't go to like five or
six times a week per muscle group
and that literally means like training
chest five or six times a week
don't go there yet because uh there's a
bunch of nuance there and there's a
chance of overreaching and over training
that's a little bit higher
nothing you want for now two to four
times a week and then
we begin to think about per session
volume so in each one of those sessions
how much how many hard sets should you
be doing
to start your process of your best guess
at the highest growth that you can have
well there's a huge benefit in starting
your exploration
on the low side okay so for whatever
volume range we end up talking about in
just a bit and
don't worry we'll give you specific
numbers and much more information on
where to find out even more specific
ones
whatever we end up with starting on the
low end of that is a much better idea
for a few reasons one it minimizes
injury risk
okay the more volume you do the more
chance it is that you'll get hurt from
at least two mechanisms one
there's a chance that you'll get hurt
any one time doing anything and the more
of it you do
the more chance there's getting hurt
it's like going out into
a thunderstorm once versus 10 times what
is your chance of getting struck by
lightning over the
you know once versus 10 times fucking
higher for 10 times because you're more
exposed to lightning as any one set
can hurt you and the more sets you do
more hurt you can get also
higher volumes create a lot more fatigue
cumulatively
and in a high fatigue environment your
chance of injury goes up again it's kind
of like
the analogy would be like if you stood
in a storm for long enough you both
simultaneously get more and more wet
which hypothetically would make you more
conductive
uh and you know you are exposing
yourself to longer longer durations of a
storm same kind of idea right
i guess the point of this whole video is
don't go outside and stand on your roof
and get all wet during a thunderstorm
unless you just unless you've seen the
movie powder
please comment in the comments if you've
seen the movie powder it's from the 90s
it's weird but kind of good
but kind of fucking weird let me know
what you think about powder that's
really the whole
crux of this issue now all right powder
aside minimizing injury risk really
really good idea
why we want to perhaps start lower than
otherwise
next volume generally from just a
snapshot perspective
relationship to gains is a u-shaped
curve okay which means that you can
train a little bit and get decent gains
you can train a moderate amount get the
best gains
and you can train a lot and still get
decent gains that you got from training
less
if you start on the low end you're much
more likely to get this
easy gains from lower volume if you
start on the high end you might get the
same gains but paying double the cost of
volume for it
fuck would you do that right it's like
someone to tell you like hey these two
burritos taste equivalently good and
they're equivalently large
one is five dollars and one is 15 which
one do you want you're like uh
15. why would you do that okay maybe the
ideal burrito costs ten dollars and it's
bigger and tastier than both
but you're not you know you don't know
which that exists yet because you have
to start at one end or another
start at the lower end it's better in
every conceivable way
all right and cool news point number
three here
you might be surprised how low of a
volume you grow from okay
a lot of folks have been doing tons and
tons of volume for months
shit years and they're growing pretty
well and sometimes not so well
and you tell them they send you a
program or something you're the coach
and they're like well this is what i'm
doing and you're like hey you know like
let's experiment with less
and they get freaked out of course
because you're like wait hold up i've
been doing like 10 sets per session for
chest
three times a week you're telling me to
do less and i'm gonna grow more what
kind of voodoo is this
right but maybe you're on that other end
of the u-shaped curve and you've just
been training really really hard for a
whole lot of
not much people think they have to train
a lot to get the best results
but once your quality is good that's not
really necessarily the case
and you may be able to get like 60
of your gains that you've been getting
at the same 60 percent of the rate
but like with one third of the volume
holy crap
and you might be able to get 120 of your
gains or something like that with like
half your volume or something that would
be incredible
right but you just have no idea because
you've been chronically doing a little
bit more it's
often very surprising how little high
quality volume you need
that might not be the case you might
need more but if you start on the lower
end and see that you're not really
growing that well it's easy to move back
up that way you cover the entire range
on the other hand if you start
really high and you get good gains you
never can tell
if less would have been even better and
a really good chance that it is
so starting really low because you'll
have to do that anyway if you don't
conclude anything starting too high
all right so we know we're going to
start low but
low on what range and that's where we go
to normative references just basically
ideas about what the average training
volume is for muscle group for people so
on and so forth
i can't do anything better in this video
than we've already done
in the renaissance periodization dot com
or whatever the hell the website is
uh hypertrophy guide central hub you can
just google that there's gonna be a link
in the description
make sure you see that because it's
every single muscle group
we've got the minimum effect of volume
maintenance volume maximum recovery
volume maximum adaptive volume
all that stuff mapped out like crazy for
each specific muscle group
the preview here is that it's roughly
the best volume to grow
somewhere between three hard-working
sets per session per muscle like three
sets of chest monday wednesday friday or
something
and ten okay now that varies there's a
lot of differences a lot of new
nuances that i won't cover here so you
have to go read the article if you want
the tip top
uh information on this topic all right
but like roughly three to ten you'd
probably start closer to three
and see how you responded right so if
you're really in the dark you have
absolutely no idea where to start
you're at your wits end with volume go
read that stuff
and it'll it'll really give some good
recommendations you want to start at the
minimum effective volume area
of that range and then move slowly up
right now these are just
averages a lot of folks say you know hey
mike you said the mrv for delts is xyz
but it is not for me like yeah that's
they're just averages
right if someone you go to a restaurant
and they give you a meal that's like a
big meal it's supposed to get you full
there's a chance you won't be able to
eat it all
you're like holy shit who the fuck can
eat this there's also a chance that
you're like wow this is really great
they just weren't lying at all there's
another chance if you're a big eater
that you're like what i need two of
these
right humans differ responses differ
situations differ so no one number can
ever tell you what you need to know you
have to do an exploratory process
yourself which is where autoregulation
comes into play big time
so how does that work first step in auto
regulation you start
at a given low volume of training okay
don't be scared
because maintenance volume is way lower
than anything that your minimum
of volume remotely would be so you're
not going to lose muscle doing this
again
unless you're playing with this on a
really extreme hypochloric fat loss diet
don't do that do this on a maintenance
or in a muscle gain phase you'll be much
better off
you're not going to lose muscle almost
guarantee you that 99.9
so start nice and low don't be afraid
and then
every session okay during and sort of
right after the session assess
what happened after you have completed
that volume
specifically on three different little
mini metrics one
how much strength and function loss did
you experience
in the muscle at the end of the session
like
were your biceps at the end just as
strong as normal and like totally felt
fine
were they like super zonked out you're
like oh my god like
i can curl like only 60 of what i used
to for reps at the end of the session
and my muscles feel like weird like it's
some something's off
right one of those indicates that you
probably provided a pretty robust
stimulus
the other indicates that you may have
not done nearly enough vault right
imagine doing one set of curls and going
like five reps away from fail
and someone's like fucking toasted your
arms right like what are you talking
about and then imagine doing like eight
sets of curls all the way
to failure and someone's like pretty
good warm-up huh and you're like no i'm
dead i'm going to die right so that's
kind of what you want to rate it on
next you want to figure out how much of
a pump you got you know there's a
spectrum here but it could be no pump
you know a little baby pump could be a
very decent pump it could be like mega
pump that you think your veins are going
to blow up on your face
you're covered in blood by the cable
curl station you're like ah
ah you look at the girl across and she's
like ah and she passes out
fucking chaos that's the ideal workout
by the way
so the third one is how sore did you get
and is that going to affect you in your
next session this one
you can only best assess in the next
session so for example you train chest
on monday
then you train it again on thursday okay
from what you did on monday
are you on thursday completely healed
and actually you never got sore
are you completely healed and you got
sworn stories lasted a couple days all
the way up to the day before the workout
on thursday
or is it you're so fucked up for monday
that you're still sore on thursday okay
that's really the kind of
the general sort of landscape of that
one all right so you figure out where
you are in all of these and it
you know there's all kinds of different
choices
and then points three four and five are
kind of the algorithm of what
to do with your volume based on average
general responses you get
okay so if
the following things are true about your
session that happened during your
session
you probably want to subtract sets the
next week you do that same session so if
monday
this shit i'm about to describe happened
next monday
you cut off one or two sets from that
session for the muscle so you did six
sets of chest this monday
if what i'm about to say happens you're
gonna do like five sets and maybe even
four sets okay so what has to happen for
you to do that well
the session left you almost crippled
okay someone's like more chest work
you're like i can't move i can't even
touch my own face what the hell are you
talking about right
uh no ratings on pump here you don't
have to worry about the pump but almost
always if you're crippled uh
pump is gonna be massive but it's not a
bad thing but if you're also crippled
and maybe a bit much
and lastly you got so sore from the
session that you didn't even heal by the
next time you train that muscle group so
monday
you got so fucked up the thursday you
were like what am i supposed to do with
my chest
i'm like somebody shot me in a shotgun
all the way across my chest that's what
i feel like okay
if that's the case the amount of damage
you're producing is probably so severe
that it actually takes recovery adaptive
resources from your cells
shuttles them to healing that damage and
away from growing you because there's a
trade-off there
right it's like saying you want to do
remodeling on a skyscraper
and instead of just pulling out some of
the floorboards and replacing them and
replacing the tvs
you just take a fucking wrecking ball
and just go and the shit falls and
you're like remodeling
here we go you know whoever's in charge
of that contracting jobs will be like
you just cost us like two billion
dollars and we only got paid one billion
to remodel a skyscraper
you're an idiot okay don't do that so
there's such a thing as too much damage
okay you're remodeling a skyscraper you
only pull out what you need and put back
what you need and that way there's a net
benefit
same idea with muscle growth so if you
think you're gonna grow your best
wrecking your muscles like crazy and
never recovering you're absolutely wrong
there's tons of science to confirm that
so it's a theory to confirm that
direct research the whole lot all right
so
to get this fucked up next time subtract
some volume
absolutely and then next time you won't
get as messed up you'll grow more
and that'll be really good so now if
this next thing happens you want to
maintain
sets which means just doing like
probably the same number it's just
really good just don't change anything
all right
what has to happen for that well the
session left you pretty weak and pretty
messed up but nothing too crazy like you
could still brush your teeth afterwards
but you're like damn
my pecs are pretty messed up and you're
definitely not as strong as you were at
the beginning of the workout
after all this volume at the end of the
work second you got a good pump or a
great pump
right because if you got a little crappy
pump maybe it wasn't enough but you're
like damn okay
holy shit shit's happening right and you
either didn't get sore at all
or you got sore enough to heal on time
for your next workout
so either on monday you just tuesday
nothing didn't get sore everything
felt great you got a great pump and
session left your week and then thursday
you're back to the gym
everything's fine or you got sore right
but
it healed by the time the thursday
rolled around so you wake up thursday
morning for your chest workout again and
you're like oh i'm fucking golden
right then gee you know you're really
checking all the boxes
and you don't need to move your volume
up or down because it's clearly
not too little and it's clearly not too
much right perfect
fucking goldilocks volume you know what
i'm saying you come in there goldilocks
is in the house
three bears mauling the fuck out of her
and she's still alive which is super
messed up because animals eat you while
you're still
living right she's like oh my god count
me you don't even have a gun you're like
this is just a farm house what am i even
doing
third thing third possible scenario okay
you raise sets if the scenario hits by
like one or two usually just one set
per muscle group per session so if you
did six sets of chest
and this what i'm about to say happened
you just add a set or add two
okay two is it's on the really really
low end of this so let's just get into
what i mean
the sessions seem to barely impact your
strength or not at all like
at the end of the session you're like
dude i could hit a pr right now like
i'm really just not that messed up i
feel more warmed up than anything okay
part b you got no pump whatsoever barely
any pump your friend's like dude pump
you're like
honestly i would be lying to you if i
said yes or you're like i don't know
yeah i guess
a little bit right not good enough and
see you didn't get sore at
all or just barely barely right just
teeny's a little bit like the next day
or just later that day you're like yeah
i guess there's something there
and then the day after that nothing and
you're like right
that's very likely just not enough
volume to have
the best gains now it would be amazing
if you could just grow your best at this
kind of volume that would mean training
would be fucking super easy
and you could do a frequency of like six
days a week all the time and survive
unfortunately it's just not the case
right so if that's the case then you
just
add one set usually two if it's like
really didn't feel anything
in the next week and then you go from
there and then the real question is what
do you do the next week
the same exact shit so
you'll notice that as you do more and
more sets or sorry uh as you do more
more weeks
week one two three four your body gets
used to shit
and maybe the six sets that used to give
you a great pump and used to make you
sore and all this other stuff and that
really like weakened your muscles
through the session
it might like start getting into that
point number five area where it's like
you know it's just really not really
doing much then you add sets in order to
fix that problem of a now insufficient
volume to your level of adaptation
to your recovery ability into your work
capacity all right
so this way volume is always adjusted to
exactly what you need or
close and it's never like oh i should be
doing this no your body will tell you if
you should be doing this
right people ask me all the time like
how much volume should be doing in the
gym randomly have a conversation
and i'm like do you get sore from this
they're like yeah do you recover on time
for work i was like yeah
do you get a pump like yeah totally
right or do you muscles feel like
they're taxed at the end
like yeah yeah for sure like i wouldn't
change anything and usually people are
not looking for that answer they're like
should i just like progress up to
infinity like why why if you're getting
great workouts why the fuck would you do
that
no good reason so auto regulation
there's a lot of wiggle room in these
interpretations i gave you three
scenarios
for a reality that's spectral like
there's an infinity number of
combinations here
all right because all these variables
are graded variables like there's no
good pump or bad pump or no pump it's
no pump slightly detectable pump all the
way in a graded manner to the biggest
pump of your life and that's when
earlier i said your veins explode and
the girl across starts to pass out
that kind of thing right so there is a
ton of wiggle room in these
interpretations
but do your best i mean this is not
rocket surgery
and you just want to air on the low side
of the additions to begin with and then
see how your body responds and then
challenge your body if it's clear that
you need more of a challenge
right as you train
and slowly add or maintain volume or
sometimes reduce it over the weeks and
weeks and weeks you're going to
accumulate fatigue
and eventually that means your rep
strength because you should always be
adding a little bit of load adding rep
here and there to try to progress
your wrap strength is going to peak and
just no more additions happen
which is probably when you should cut it
off and or you start to get a little
weaker which is
definitely when you should cut it off if
you haven't already
when that happens you want to deload and
put yourself at maintenance volumes like
a third of what you were doing normally
really recover really relax and then
start back at what your estimate is for
your minimum effective volumes which was
the same estimate you used last time
right and if last time you started and
you were way too sore use even less than
that
okay start low after a deload because
your body
really really loses a lot of its work
capacity
over the course of a deal and that's
okay and it really regains some
sensitivity to hypertrophy after a
deload damn near the only
point of the deload and it really can go
back down to really nice and low volumes
and provide a really robust stimulus so
you it's not like you go
from five sets a session to 10 sets and
then restart after dealer
10 sets and go to 15. what the fuck
you'd be i ended up at 50 sets in three
months and dead they'd find you on the
side of the road right
you died from too much volume another
one yeah jim
it's a tough day in volume city i don't
fucking know but in any case
what you want to do is like start at
like you know maybe four and end at
eight
and then start at four and end today
then start four and end at eight or nine
if you had a good session or a good good
message cycle
and then at some point starting at four
might be like uh you know like it's
really just not checking the boxes
then you could consider starting at five
or in which this will cover
in many other videos to come you can do
a low volume maintenance resensitization
phase
to get your body re-sensitized back to
lower volumes you can do an active rest
phase so on and so forth so there's tons
of options
but you don't want to just progressively
do more and more volume over the
mesocycle average
within a mesocycle during the
accumulation phase where you do more and
more and more
something a volume can be a part of that
something if the checking the boxes in
our regulations says it should be
but over meso to meso to measure there's
no rule that says volume has to go up
over time
it tends to on average but you can do
re-sensitization phases and stuff like
that
that over your career keeps your volume
per
session on average roughly about the
same right and that's letting your body
and your strength adaptations and so on
and forth
decide right you do this
and boom you're looking at
individualized volumes tailored exactly
to you
and when someone asks you how much
volume do you do
you can say well there's this amazing
video on the renaissance periodization
let me write that down for you it's
fucking hard to spell
youtube channel you should subscribe to
that channel
and you tell them this renaissance
periodization is a
is a very small company and we don't
have a lot of money
sometimes i don't have enough to eat
send
dr mike at random sensation your money
plead with them you can get on your
knees and cry if you have to
sell it sell it because i fucking need
money god damn it folks
i don't even know what i said see you
next time for the next video
