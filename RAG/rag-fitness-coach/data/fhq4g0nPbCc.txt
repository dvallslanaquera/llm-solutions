hey folks it's me dr mike israel here
for renaissance periodization welcome to
the bs series i can't call it it's real
name because youtube hates that sort of
thing swearing corrupt children as we
all know
today's not so true statement is that
lifting weights will make you huge
big enormous gargantuan people will uh
think that they're either talking to you
or godzilla but they can't quite tell
you apart anymore
so here's the deal this is total bs
why
for a few reasons
reason number one and really the only
reason
is that only calorie balance can add
tissue to your body over time
eating more calories than you burn is
the only thing that makes you bigger
by bigger weaning heavier on the scale
which is the only way anyone really ever
gives a about being big anyway
that's it
yes there are body water fluctuations
that can
take the scale up put the scale down you
know a few pounds here and there but
outside of that if you want to get much
bigger you simply have to eat more
uh plenty more consistently more
than you are expending that's it right
now
lifting doesn't actually determine if
you get bigger
it does determine the composition of the
gains so if you don't lift and you eat a
bunch of extra food you will gain lots
of extra fat and not so much extra
muscle
if you do lift nice and hard you will
eat
plenty of extra food and then you will
actually gain
mostly muscle and not so much fat so
what you gain lifting does determine so
it absolutely is a portal to muscle
growth but you gotta your portal guns
gotta set the calories to something
positive otherwise the portal doesn't
hope or at least not much
now there is a nuance here and a
complication to this
in some people lifting pretty
predictably increases their appetite one
of my friends is like a really tall and
skinny guy genetically and after he
lifts weights as a matter of fact midway
through his workout he becomes ravenous
and i've seen him put down thousands of
calories after lifting and just be
perfectly fine not even full he's like
oh thank god that hit the spot i'm like
holy we just eat
that is definitely a thing
however if you eat mostly healthy foods
that are really filling
protein veggies fruits whole grains etc
then there is not you can counter
balance that hunger increase and
actually just put on tons of muscle
while losing fat at the same time
especially if you just started lifting
if you want to keep your weight stable
long term
you can lift until the cows come home
and by controlling your calories you
don't have to get an ounce of body
weight
ever there's not like a time where they
go i gotta really gotta cut back on the
lifting i'm getting too big you
gotta come back out of eating that's the
only thing that actually makes you too
big
a lot of people actually lose weight
when they add in lifting because they
don't get that rebound hunger response
and lifting weights burns plenty of
calories and they end up losing weight
while they're lifting weights and they
gain muscle and lose a ton of fat at the
same time voila nobody got ginormous
so
will you get huge just by lifting
weights
ladies looking at you here because it's
still a thing
and on average
males seem to be pretty interested in
getting bigger so at the very least they
don't care if weights make them look
bulky but a lot of females think i'm
gonna start lifting weights emma turned
into what was her name in that matilda
movie trench bowl or whatever
is that accurate yeah uh definitely my
type of lady i'd be like yo what's up
you know what i'm saying i kind of
envision myself as like some air
conditioning contractor that comes to
the school they have in the universe and
like i'm just like walking in and she's
like you fix the air conditioner i'm
like yo i'm saying i can do it now
we get a pop or i could do it now
and we could get a popping after clearly
not at a school that's degenerate
behavior i assume this trench bowl has
somewhere to live and ostensibly
fornicate
in any case if that's not your jam no
worries you actually can't get enormous
shot put or big without eating plenty of
calories so lifting by itself is not a
way to gain size not at all not even
close
because that's
and even arnold knows it doesn't
actually work in real life and who are
you really to debate arnold
just like me nobody see you guys next
time
you
