hey folks dr mike for renaissance
periodization here again with another bs
video series heads up
disclaimer i have coveted
again
i had it uh like a year and a half ago
and
it sucked but it wasn't the end of the
world i have it now it's hopefully at
the tail end and it sucked but not the
end of the world um
if i cough a deathly cough and scott the
video guy doesn't edit that out you guys
know that i've got as my sister says the
vid
i got the bid
she's got the bid new music video yes
it's in the works so
unrelated but actually the topic of this
video is health at every size
apparently it's bs
don't worry i'll do the arnold
impression impersonation later
why
so first of all what is the central
claim
of health at every size there is the
claim
and there's actually a movement and even
an organization
called hayes health at every size
and slightly different
the his organization is insanely
political i'll dig that rabbit hole out
later
but um
generally
the underlying current of claims behind
that organization and all the
organizations around it
is that and when i say this it's going
to sound a little nutty so to many of
you and it should because it is but it
is not an exaggeration of the position
of the folks in that organization and
that sort of line of reasoning it sounds
like an exaggeration because it's
fucking nuts
but this is the actual claim
that a person's body weight doesn't have
any meaningful or predictable effects on
their health
even if their body weight is uh
excessive
people who are you know in the mid five
foot range weighing two three four
pounds
the claim is that
it's not actually the excess weight
that's causing the health maladies
but other things that are causing the
health maladies um one of the central
tenets
of a lot of the movements associated
with this claim again this is going to
sound insane
my apologies for caricaturing it that
way but you'll hear in a sec
one of the central claims is that the
health maladies are caused not by the
excessive body fat itself
but by
an anti-obesity
bias that exists throughout our entire
society
and is particularly pernicious in the
medical establishment whereby people who
just happen to be obese but also happen
to have unrelated
terrible medical problems
the doctors focus so much on their
obesity and trying to get them to lose
weight that they don't get the adequate
treatment that they need with their
actual medical problems
and the claim here is that the medical
problems have nothing to do with the
obesity
about five percent of that makes some
sense you do get some old school doctors
that will not prescribe blood pressure
medications and
cholesterol modulating drugs and a
variety of other things they won't even
be compassionate and listen to the
patient where they're coming from
and they'll just say well you need to
lose weight and here's this coffee and
fish diet or some stupid shit that
worked back in the 50s worked
and that definitely happens a small
small tiny minority of cases still
happens and it's unjust and it's stupid
and it's fucking wrong
there's a very very big gulf between
that
and the idea that
a high level of body fat and weight is
actually not deleterious to your health
so let's dig into that claim
here's the reality point number one here
on the slide
high adiposity which is like high amount
of body fat tissue
is one of the central factors in
modulating risk for almost all diseases
certainly the biggest killers in the
united states
especially cardiovascular disease and
definitely cancer and all the other
diseases and metabolic syndrome diabetes
etc
it's an unbelievably enormous factor it
affects disease
your degree of body fatness it affects
your quality of life
sometimes in non-obvious ways sometimes
in very obvious ways like you can't
fucking put on a seat belt
and of course longevity outcomes in
which it is massive there's a number of
people that weigh over 600 pounds
that make it into their 40s and 50s you
can count on like one hand
it's a huge killer
as you get older
continuing to be in a state of high body
fatness
gets even more and more and more
deleterious to your health and even
higher risk for you
having really fall off the cliff health
outcomes anytime
the research on this is
decades old
it is compounding in an exponential way
where we get more and more research and
more and more and more research all the
time to confirm these ideas
it is methodologically as close to rock
solid as we have for almost anything
else in medicine
and by experts in the
body
in the medical community especially in
the obesity specialist community
it is not controversial
it is controversial only to a relatively
small but very vocal
minority of folks
not even really in the medical community
that are primarily
interested in social activism
and that's how this kind of stuff gets
popular and you'll scroll through
instagram and people say oh you can have
you can be healthy at any size body
weight doesn't matter it's a myth
and
that claim is claimed number two
the claim is that you can be healthy in
any size and then if you're bigger or
smaller it doesn't really matter health
is something that occurs sort of
independently of how large or how fat
you are
and that is actually true for a few
cases one is a tiny minority of younger
people
who just have that for lack of a better
term there are better terms for it
youthful invincibility
like when you're young your skin is
perfect
your health is perfect you can eat
fucking mcdonald's every day
and you're fucking have abs somehow and
your blood works amazing
and then as you get into your later 20s
and your 30s and your 40s all that shit
goes downhill
so there are younger people in their
teens to early mid 20s that are very
over fat but on straight up just
youthful energy and all of the youthful
processes in the body working
at 100 percent they don't feel the
consequences of their uh obesity in
their blood work or in their systemic
conditions
imagine they're already in the minority
because most people even in their early
20s that experience a high degree of
obesity
they're in very poor health relative to
their cohort of other people that age
some people they can skate by for a
while and that dovetails into point
number two here or a and b
point b is that in the short term
you can get people if you bring them
into the hospital and test the living
shit out of them
some of them are very over fat but their
blood work and systemic inflammation
markers and everything else look
actually very good
and
this research came out maybe about a
decade ago
and they it was like there it was like a
conundrum
publication of like
fit but or fat but fit fat but healthy
did we miss something and of course the
health of every size people ran the fuck
away with that oh my god this is it this
is living proof
the problem is multiple other studies
that followed up with the same people
and with different people that also had
good blood work and everything earlier
found that months and years later almost
everyone took a tumble off a cliff
and all of a sudden they're health
degraded from very predictable
obesiogenic body fat related cause
and then after just a few years they
looked like everyone else who was that
fat in very very terrible health
so
the really nasty analogy here is like
if there's a delay here
that
being fat
way over fat degrades your health under
the hood
and sometimes you can't see her to
detect it but eventually it catches up
with pretty much everybody
similar idea to you know if you pull a
pin out of a grenade
there are a few seconds there where
you're not you're not blown up yet
you're safe and you can say look it's
fine bang
and then someone later could be like it
was not fine there was a delay so it
turns out that yes you can for some time
be healthy at
many sizes
but the bigger you are the more body fat
you have relative to what your body is
more or less designed to hold by
evolution
the
more likely it is that that cliff of
degrading health happens faster
and the way health and the human body
works especially systemic health not
like i have an ouchy right here
is that it's very intertwined
in that for example if you as a result
of your high adiposity
start to exhibit chronic high systemic
inflammation
that starts to affect your lipid values
it affects your glucose dynamics
it affects delivery of nutrients to
various structures in your body
the whole system
starts to get pinched hard and start
crashing down
you know it's almost like if you say
look if we blew up 90 of the roads in
the united states how would the economy
work poorly
because they're so critical to the
entire delivery of everything everything
everything
so it's a bad deal and even if you're
okay for a while it will catch up to you
in almost every single case so it is
actually true to say that you can have
health at every size in some cases
for a little bit of time
but to that end you can also smoke
cigarettes in your 20s and be fucking
totally great
and then in your late 30s they spot
something in your lungs like that's
fucking lung cancer and you're like god
damn it i thought this was safe like it
was for some time but under the hood it
was doing tons of damage speaking of
which
oh yeah
when i'm sick i reach for ascent casing
actually it's in hot water
casey and alicious it's actually pretty
good
you guys can just witness me die right
here on the screen
it's got the video guy if i die from
covet on video you'll still publish this
yes
i had to all clickbait it click the beat
the fuck out dr mike dead three question
marks in parentheses yes period
if you don't do the second parentheses
um you're not really a youtuber that's
what we've come to find out so okay
back to the serious stuff
yes
high adiposity now or later
will destroy your health and potentially
kill you much faster than anything else
however
because we know that that does not mean
that yelling at fat people and telling
them to lose weight is a good idea
why is it a bad idea
the fundamental reason is that it just
doesn't work very well there is a
category
take all the people that
could lose weight and get a lot of
health benefit out of it
if you yell at all of them and say you
stupid fat fucks shut up put the fork
down typical instagram comments when
anyone of a fat or size post some kind
of picture of anything
the fraction of fatter people that will
respond positively to that and actually
lose weight and be like man thank god
somebody yelled at me because otherwise
i wasn't going to change my life around
is teeny tiny
and the fraction of people that will
hear that stuff and either just become
much more sad and their life gets worse
or become recalcitrant and be like if
anyone ever tells me shit about my weed
again i throw up the middle finger i
block the fuck out of my i don't they're
not even in my life
that fraction of that people is probably
like an order of magnitude larger than
the fraction of people you're helping
so while
to somebody who's not over fat or to
somebody who's been over fat and has
done some fitness things and gotten to a
leaner state it may be very fulfilling
for you to yell at people and tell them
their pieces of shit and they're fat and
should lose weight
but
the first problem with that is it's not
very effective it's by no means the most
effective thing you could be doing to
help them ostensibly you are doing this
to help them
if you're not doing it to help them
you're just yelling at people to be mean
and like that's fucked up
like why would you just go out of your
way to be mean to people
almost everyone is fat knows they're fat
and almost everyone is fat doesn't like
it so if you come up to them and you're
like you should lose weight no shit
motherfucker you know how many times
i've heard that right it's not helpful
and it's also mean
now if it was very helpful but mean we
could put up like a tough love sort of
thing but yeah shit happens cool
but it's not very helpful it does help
some people but a tiny tiny fraction
there are way more helpful things you
can do that helps the vast majority of
those people right
so it works way too influentially for us
to do it and it's really really mean so
it's fucking stupid
but that doesn't mean you go back the
other way
it doesn't mean you say hey it's okay
you don't have to lose weight
and it doesn't matter what you weigh
you'll still be healthy because that's
just straight up bullshit
not being mean to people and not doing
ineffective things to help them
is not the same thing as tacitly
accepting that hey it's okay because
it's not okay they are very poor and
constantly chronically degrading health
so we don't have to admit
that oh they're okay in order for us to
stop harassing them ineffectually right
there's a middle ground there somewhere
that has a
much more effective approach
and here it is
some people
may just not be ready psychologically to
look at the scale
a lot of the stuff with body fatness
it's just people who don't give a fuck
i eat food because it fucking tastes
good
and i come to the doctor once a year and
the doctor is like you're too fat you
need to lose weight you're going to
fucking die
in my heart of hearts i don't give a
fuck
my personal hypothesis
is that that's probably the vast
majority of obese people in the united
states
i got all the love in the world for him
fuck
live your shit out so you live for 60
years instead of 80. you have a good
time doing it
food tastes fucking great if you're like
hey dr mike you want to be like a
starving
fasting vegan for 90 years or do you
want to like live 60 years like a
fucking party animal
i don't know it's not clear to me which
one of those is the right answer and i
totally respect the fuck out of people's
personal choices
so those people we just fucking just try
to do your best to
being nice to them and if they seem very
unaware of the fact that body fatness is
bad for the health you could very gently
tell them about it and be like
you could be living a better life
but if they don't want to hear it no big
deal
there's another subcategory a very large
category of people
who they know that being fat is no good
for the health
and
they have some real hang-ups about their
body image which is totally fucking
understandable by the way because most
of us do and if you look
a certain way that most people don't
consider attractive including yourself
it fucking gets in your head
it's fucking tough
and some of those people are just not
ready to look at the scale
and when you tell them lose weight lose
weight lose weight it implies get on the
scale and watch it go down get on the
scale and do things and watch it go down
some of those people are so
for lack of a better term like
allergic or sensitized to the scale just
yelling bad things at them and they
fucking hate it and say you're a failure
failure fat nobody loves you that's what
the number says to them they're just not
ready to step on the scale
which is a lot of the people
who end up finding the health at every
size movement and philosophy appealing
because if i tell you you're okay no
matter what size you are
you're probably willing to hear that if
the scale tells you your piece of shit
all the time in your head
some people are not ready to look at the
scale and that's so fucking totally cool
i can't over exaggerate the point more
you don't need to look at the scale
those people we can still reach them
by introducing them to healthy habits
and we don't have to look at the scale
until they're ready because like if
you've dropped like five dress sizes
you might be interested in looking at
the scale and being like oh my god i'm
180 it used to be 250. this is
unbelievable and then the scale turns
from a bad thing to an unbelievably
great thing
but some people will never be ready to
look at the scale or not for a very long
time and we don't actually ever have to
address
the approaches to enhancing someone's
health
that don't require you to lose weight
are called weight neutral approaches and
they're fucking amazing they work really
well
because if you think about it you don't
actually really need to look at the
scale much unless you're like in
physique competition
or unless you're in a place where you're
going from like 160 pounds 150 pounds
and it's not obvious from your opinions
if it's working or not but if you're
super super fucking obese
it's kind of obvious when you're losing
weight especially on the month's order
of scale in which it actually matters
we also know another thing
people
almost always are not obese by accident
or by some sort of dint of their
metabolism being weird my metabolism's
low that doesn't actually happen very
often
most people are that are very grossly
over fat i don't mean gross in a sense
it's disgusting gross in the sense of if
it's a lot
picking all the wrong words here
those people almost never get that fat
by just following healthy habits and
having a little bit extra walnuts oh
these walls are so good i have them at
night and i'm just 900 fucking pounds if
i got here
most of those people have preposterously
unhealthy habits
like eating the fucking kitchen sink of
almost exclusively junk food
if you're interested in seeing the
extremity of this
watch i think it's on hulu my 600 pound
life
these people eat exclusively junk food
and i mean exclusively junk food unless
you count chinese food and pizza as junk
you do
so they eat exclusive junk
and a lot of it
if you can reach some of these folks
and just get them to eat
more balanced meals more healthy foods
healthy foods are so satiating relative
to their calories
it's almost impossible to sustain
weighing let's say 300 pounds eating
almost exclusively healthy foods how do
we know this power lifters strongmen and
bodybuilders have tried this and it's
fucking awful
i have clean mast
mostly clean mast to 250 pounds
i would look at food and be like if i
never have to eat food again it'll be
amazing
i can't fucking do this anymore
now if i had to mass using twinkies and
m ms and pizza i could get 350 and not
bat a fucking eye it'd be tasty and fun
until my health degraded enough for me
to be aware of it
but what we can do
is introduce folks to these healthy
habits of eating more veggies eating
more fruits
eating whole grains and healthy fats and
all that stuff staying away more from
junk food and more towards healthy
options
without ever having to tell them to look
at the scale without ever telling them
hey you're fat you need to lose weight
you just introduce them to this idea
that they could be eating healthier and
maybe becoming a little bit more active
they lose
dozens of pounds in the course of months
just from that alone
we can help in a major way without being
mean or psychotic or snubbing their nose
like a dog that pisses in the wrong
place into the scale and being like
you're too fat that number says three
something it needs to say one something
we don't have to do any of that in the
vast majority of cases we can help tons
and tons of people
because in order to be the most
effective
at helping people
we need to meet people with compassion
right
like any time you're on youtube and you
don't have any friends and you
masturbate half the day and you decide
you're going to go on videos of fat
people and comment how fat and pieces of
shit they are and that they need to lose
weight
you're not being compassionate but
ostensibly you're giving them valuable
advice
because if someone's like dude what are
you doing you'd be like it's right isn't
it yeah
but why do you want to be right why not
just tell them wrong things and have
their heads spin if you're fucking with
them anyway why not just fuck with them
hard like well like i have their best
interests in mind it's good for them
like oh you know your best interest in
mind that means you're compassionate
right local yeah i am right but
compassion
we can do a better job
like the doctor can perform heart
surgery on you and then not sew you up
and be like i did the fucking surgery
will sue me up motherfucker it's a
closed loop
if you're really actually being
compassionate
you could say shit nicer in a way that
makes fucking sense to them and doesn't
tell them to just go jump off a bridge
because they're too fucking fat
so
meet people we could do a better job
meeting people with compassion
meet them where they are they tell you
look i don't want to fucking look at the
scale
no problem no problem
do you want to try like just eating a
little bit differently and you're still
super filling you won't be hungry it'll
be really awesome they might be like
yeah yeah maybe i'll try that right
and we have to approach people in ways
they can benefit from not just ways that
make us feel good on instagram when
we're insulting fat people
in the privacy of our own homes
i like to envision the scene with
jizz rags everywhere
and like a really dirty monitor
you're fat
you know
that was my childhood
in any case we can approach people with
compassion we can meet them where they
are we can help them in ways that most
benefit them for example through weight
neutral approaches of just helping
people change their lifestyle because
lifestyle is what changes everything
else anyway it's what does the weight
loss
and we don't have to lie to people
about how okay their health is at every
size
because it's fucking not and because
that's bullshit
controversial episode maybe tell us in
the comments thanks for tuning in see
you guys next time
unless i die of coping then i'll see you
never
