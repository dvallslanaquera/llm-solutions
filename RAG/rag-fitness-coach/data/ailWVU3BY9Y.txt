folks we're back weekly webinar
answering those youtube questions dr
mike how's it going i am alive
um getting ready to finish out this cut
today is actually my last day of the
hypocaloric condition
and i have been hypercaloric more or
less for 20
weeks straight so yeah it's been fun
but uh i'm alive enough to do a webinar
let us uh alternative yeah dead too dead
to do a webinar
let us go to the first question which
comes from john
the john just john got it
[Music]
so john says if we generally build
muscle during a cut
why train over mv slash
don't build muscle right if we generally
don't build muscle during the cut sorry
i must have said something else um
y train over mvmev so
you probably shouldn't uh now so
what happens is is at the beginning of a
cut
you can actually do some recomposition
and build some muscles at the beginning
of a cut it's
probably okay to go from mvv to mrv um
or that is to say go quite a bit beyond
your mv
i think that's fine there is an
alternative approach where you start off
the cut really easy with training you
just
don't get a lot of fatigue but sometimes
some recomposition does the body good
later into your cut you actually get
into the situation where this question
becomes
no longer relevant and here's why your
maintenance volume starts to climb so
high in a hypochloric condition after
so much train fatigue and so much lower
body fat that your maintenance volume
starts to be more like your med used to
be and starts to push up into your mrv
at the end of every muscle
so just by staying ahead of maintenance
volume you end up going from nvp to mrv
and d-loading anyway
now does that mean like if you're
getting good pumps getting good uh
soreness and your performance is going
well
in the last week uh of a cut or the last
two weeks before deload should you push
it that little bit extra
to get those gains and have that fatigue
come down and so on and so forth
probably not in a cut it's time to just
be like i'm getting high quality
training it's enough for sure
i'm just gonna just do what i do uh
we're on a mass
it's like if the question is should i
push it a little further and there's a
legit question
like you're not already super fucked up
the answer is probably yes it's worth it
so on a cut yeah that little nuance is
there but in general
uh at the beginning of a cut training
meet mrv is fine because it has some
recomposition effects especially if you
did proper periodization and you started
the cut uh
relatively sensitive to volume and
fatigue reduced
and at the end of a cut it's a non-issue
because just staying ahead of mv is
what you normally would be between your
medium
that's a really good answer and i think
there's some personal um preference into
that so some people would just rather
not push the systemic fatigue boundaries
too hard during cuts because they're
sensitive to it and they might
hang a little bit closer to mev more or
less the whole time
and that's going to kind of creep up as
you go as mike already kind of mentioned
um but some other people just like to
train hard and that's perfectly okay too
so
what we this is kind of one of those
great areas where we don't necessarily
have to take a hard line and say
you should train any v to mrv or you
should only train at you know mev
mav levels either one is kind of fine
like me personally
i hate doing like mev training because
it's like it's like a tease
it's like you like opened up pornhub and
then never got to the stuff that you
were looking at right you're like damn
now i'm just horny this sucks um so for
so for me i'm i'm more on the mev to mrv
window
because i enjoy training because i feel
like it's just more worth my time
and personal preference but uh am i
potentially paying a higher fatigue cost
in doing so
yes absolutely but for some people they
just enjoy training like myself
other people uh the fatigue they're
really sensitive to fatigue factors and
they might
dial it back a little bit and that's
okay too i do think
that for kind of your late beginner to
kind of maybe late intermediate crowd
there might be some transient benefits
from training from mev to mrv even
during a cut that might manifest later
on i don't know that that's true i
suspect
that it's true i suspect that it's true
especially for beginners
um but for advanced lifters like dr mike
for example uh there's probably
nothing doing going on there so you're
probably just better off taking the mev
style training because you're
realistically not gonna have any
transient effects
now just to mention one more thing
that's coming to my mind i think james
may be allowed to agree with this
estimating mv is actually quite hard um
it's a lot easier to get somewhere
between mvv and mrv because all the
indicators are there pump soreness etc
performance
uh mv is tough uh to estimate and if you
mis-estimate mv
when you don't have a bodybuilding show
coming up it's just a regular cut you'll
regain the muscle no big deal
uh but most people want to look really
good at the end of a cut
and some even transient muscle loss is
maybe not something you want
so if you train above what you think
your mev
is possibly cycling to mrv really you
just the mrv comes down to you anyway
right because of the accumulated fatigue
uh
training a little bit higher than mv
probably has some consideration just put
in your head
because if you err on the side of
fundamentally it's just really hard to
hit that dart board you don't know where
the bullseye is and if you hit a little
bit to the left of it
you don't quite reach mv you're going to
lose muscle put this in a very specific
circumstance like if you are like doing
a
bodybuilding show you want to place as
well as possible you're like okay i
don't want to fuck up my quads and i
want to train super hard i want to want
to
have systemic fatigue like i'm going to
train at mv and it turns out like you
lose a little bit of quad size
at the show but right at the show that
matters it could be the difference
between first and third
and uh you might not want to do that so
in stranger situations like a hard cut
you might want to put the cherry on top
of like the same applies to the deficit
like you know in a cup when it's
seriously time to get lean
you have an estimate for what you think
the deficit is make sure you're
either right at that estimate or a
little bit below that in calories
on average just to make sure like yeah
for sure i know i'm gonna deficit and
that's 99 problems but
you know calories ain't one it would
suck to do weeks and weeks of cutting
and realize you're really kind of
estimating your deficit because you just
wanted didn't want to shut down your
metabolism
and it turns out like you spent a lot of
time uh running in place
now uh especially that's the case if
you're preparing to look really good
and order a bodybuilding show just like
four weeks out you look at your physique
so does your coach you're like
we're behind that's not a place you want
to be on the other hand if you're four
weeks out and you're ahead
there are some things you can do for
sure to slow you down and it's not
nearly as big of a cost
yeah that was a really good response too
and just for any of you so i know some
of you have been listening to us for a
long time and you might be thinking like
how are you gonna miss the mv i thought
you guys said it's so low it's always
lower than you think
the problem in this situation is that
you're doing a really hard diet and your
mv is going up over time so it's easy to
miscalculate
based on what you would normally do
under like a normal cut or like you know
maintenance
kind of conditions that's where the
problem is
next up is henrik anderson
mr anderson
got it he says hey doc last week i asked
three questions and one comment which
you shouldn't have done
so here's the question i really want to
be answered for small muscle groups you
got upvoted so it worked this time
for sure for small muscle groups uh
smaller muscle groups like adults
is it possible to rest too long if the
burn starts to go away
can it negatively impact hypertrophy so
my best answer to this is the following
the predominant source of hypertrophy is
tension
uh assuming you're going closer to
failure uh at every cent
um but there are other pathways those
that have been pretty well confirmed
including the metabolite pathway and so
on and so forth
so it's also likely or at least possible
that different muscle groups muscle
fibers and potentially even like
individual muscles
respond a little bit more to one pathway
versus another so the pump we know
literally grows muscle you know
metabolites grow muscle and we know
tension grows muscle
uh tension does the most of the muscle
growth but the other ones may account
for quite a bit of muscle growth
and if they're not present so if you
rest a long time metabolite
sequestration
doesn't really happen nearly as much
because metabolites get flushed out they
don't have enough time to sit around in
the cell and really poke the fucking
mechanisms to be like hey i'm here
grow the pump if you lose the pump
between every set or a lot of it that's
that might not get us maximum of a
cellular volumizing effect and
transiently and that might not uh
accrete enough of the ribosomal proteins
et cetera to do what you wanted to do
not as much as much growth so because
it's one of the situations where some
muscles
may respond really well to those
metabolic pump pathways
you may find that if you wait a little
too long and
uh the pump uh and you know the burn
should go away completely between each
set
but like i think i think you mean like
the pump and like you just feel
completely fresh again
if that goes away uh maybe like maybe
that's a little too long right and
try it and if your adult training
results in worse outcomes then it's like
yes that's confirmed
for some muscles uh just examples in my
body like hamstrings and chest
and stuff like that they're super fast
which the longer i rest kind of the
better
and the only reason i don't rest super
long is because i just have to be
somewhere else
at some point i'm not spending 20
minutes between each exercise also
there's a cooling down effect i don't
want to recool down
but look look if i do high bar good
mornings ideally i rest five to eight
minutes
before the next set and have another
fucking ball or a set of hybrid mornings
and that makes me stronger and stronger
and stronger and more attentional for
weeks and weeks and weeks and i get the
biggest hamstrings
that i possibly can but that's not the
same for all the muscles and for some of
my muscles i have that very same
experience doubts free biceps forearms
if i rest too long between the sets of
forearms i feel like i'm restarting the
process the entire time
and i i survive that it probably doesn't
result in optimal growth
another really quick caveat is a lot of
people mess this up much worse
they'll have their reps from last week
and it'll be 10 8 7
right this week they're going to do a
little bit more weight
but again 1087 because we're trying to
match wraps a little bit more weight
which is
strategy but this week they'll talk to
people between sets more and they'll
rest much more
so what they end up doing is still 1087
but the rir because you get so much rest
the
reps of reserve is much higher the
proximity to failure is lower and the
hypertrophic effect of each set
probably isn't as great you get the same
amount of mechanical tension
total over the workout but you obviate
almost all the pump effects and almost
all the metabolite effects and those do
add up
and that's where our ir really comes in
handy and sometimes even the tension
effects
because a lot of the reason we go close
to failures because the big gnarly
faster rich motor units only maybe
really turn on the most
close to failure now you're not even
turning them on like that set of eight
was hard the first week because you did
a minute rest
this week it's a minute thirty rest in a
set of eight is like you guys ever had
that where you match your reps you're
like i'm done that was easy
like this shit shouldn't be that easy it
should be a little harder than last time
so uh or as hard so that's something
else to keep
a track of and be aware of so if you do
rest long
for something like delts and a muscle
that like if it loses its pop is not
great make sure you make up for that
long rest by doing the true rer you
targeted which could be like
i've done james you've done like a set
of 12 on delts and then you rest a
little too long check your emails and
then you do a set of 14
and like as you pass 10 you're like last
week i did 10 but like i'm not going to
stop this is ridiculous i got me like 6r
and you actually go to 14 and you're
like oh that was a proper set and then
you get back a lot of the pump in the
burn
that you would have never had because
you're training appropriately hard
i have absolutely done that and it's
actually a really good segue to the
point that i was going to make which is
for something like delts in particular
like if you are resting so long
that you you don't see any meaningful
performance drops
in reps from set to set you're probably
resting too long right if you're
one of our stimulus processes by the way
yeah so if you do like a set of 15 and
you're waiting long enough to do like
another set of 15 like
that's too long right and just because
for all the reasons that mike already
said so mike used like the pump is a
really good example
of a good timeline to keep and i think
performance is another one that you can
look at where it's like okay if i did
15 15 14 14 like you're probably resting
too long at that point for dents
totally peter
wingler that's not really his name
wait a second see if i
yep there it is all right
he puts the wang and wangler you feel me
see that wang son so yeah peter send us
pictures of your penis
okay peter english says asks all my life
people told me to do 8 to 12 reps for
biceps but for whatever reason it never
worked for me
so i always had underwhelming biceps due
to quote genetics oh my god story of my
life
yeah my life too it was only until i did
uh sets of four to six
reps that they started growing why is
that personal trainers yeah for the same
period
but same same exact concept as we're
talking about um why is that personal
traders always told me four to six for
strength and eight to twelve percent is
that not the case so it is the case uh
four to six makes you stronger than
eight
to twelve but the hypertrophy effects
can be similar and or identical because
anything
roughly between five and thirty reps per
set close to failure
roughly over the average is equivalent
but individuals have a very varied
response some people grow a bit more
from tension some people grow a bit more
from high tension absolutely
some grow from the same amount of
tension but spread over more repetitions
some people grow more from metabolites
in the pump so you really have to find
this is why our stimulus proxies our sfr
thing uh is a little ghetto calculator
such a cool tool
because like if you probably peter i'm
gonna make a guess that when you were
doing sets of eight to twelve for biceps
you probably didn't get a big pump
you probably didn't get a big burn you
probably didn't feel a whole lot of
disruptive
tension in your biceps and set to such
as that they probably didn't tire that
much and you probably didn't get that
sore
now you're doing such a four to six
you're probably feeling a fuck load of
tension your biceps are holy shit this
shit's gonna rip my biceps apart
you're probably getting at least as good
of pumps as you were from sets of eight
to twelve
and you're probably getting a little
sore maybe like a retired really tired
beat up feeling at the end of the
workout if not sore
so you have to follow those proxies and
of course do all the rep ranges to some
extent
but bias more of your training into the
rep ranges that give you those proxies
like if you're doing chest flies and
sets of 25 because some pro said that's
how you chisel it in
and it just makes you tired you don't
feel pumped or stretched or burned
but if you do sets of chest flies like
cable fly somehow you do sets of six
and it just fucking destroys your chest
i mean man you're probably onto
something you know like
no one ever is going to tell you like
when you do something and it really
fucks you up and it really gives you a
crazy
crazy bird and you're able to add load
to it over time and it's growing
that it's the wrong answer so the
personal trainers were right that on
average sets of 8 to 12 are really good
sfr for hypertrophy on the very very
average
but that absolutely comes with tons of
exceptions that that's why you got to
find your own best rep ranges which can
change over time
sometimes it's this another variation
sometimes it's that always a mix always
a combination
actually the pleasure of training a guy
who could have been on the olympia stage
eventually he just literally didn't want
to get
any bigger because he would have to buy
new clothes lame excuse i know but he
had like
literally phil heath shaped arms again
i'm not joking it's not an exaggeration
but they weren't that big
he was drug free but he was like 180 and
like five seven and he just had that
shape that was just like what the fuck
is wrong with your biceps triceps and
i remember programming sets of 10 to 15
for biceps for him and he's like i'm
just
getting tired like hmm so we did sense
of five to ten and he's like my biceps
are going faster than i can fucking
measure my arms and i'm like oh shit
okay
so those are faster switch biceps which
is probably why they were big to begin
with and had that fucking gnarly shape
um and it worked so it's all
it's all really personal damned james
yeah yeah really good uh so just
a funny anecdote i had this i have the
same problem where i did
the sets of 10 ish for my arms forever
and also i have a giant wingspan i have
fucking
long arms and i have had chronic skinny
arms
my whole fucking life and only recently
do i feel
remotely uh confident when i wear like a
tank top
showing off my arms now because i've
been doing better arm training the last
few years and for me
uh kind of slightly different in that
the 10 to 20
was the zone that i just completely
overlooked for so many years and then
once i started working in that range
more
my arms became much more responsive so
as mike said it's very
inter-individual and then even within an
individual you might have some pretty
greatly different responses across
different muscles so you just kind of
got to figure out what works for you
i will say even for fast twitch you know
superman like yourself
i have a hard time recommending going
super heavy on biceps for uh
injury management reasons so i think
like five to ten
is kind of is is on par with what we
normally recommend
but i do think that's a good guideline i
really wouldn't go
using weights where you're actually um
uh
training your biceps any less than five
reps no i don't mean that like
i mean like you're you're doing things
that's like a heavy four like
man that's that you're pushing your luck
in my opinion that's not to say that you
won't respond to it you might respond
but you also might
pay the price and injury later on so you
probably want to strike a balance there
just be careful
totally payton downs
payton also with an a
pay ton got it
in a maintenance phase will stifle like
a deadlifts alone or ham curls alone
maintain my hamstrings or do i need
both a curl and a stretching type of
lift i mean by a long shot the unanimous
answer is
anything that generally remotely
stimulates your hands is good enough for
maintenance phase
i actually couldn't hit pinch for a
while because i had some weird like
sartorius injury that's now just now
resolving
i just started hip hinging again i
didn't hit hinge at all
for like four months five months of the
last and my hamstrings are the biggest
they've ever been
and i've been cutting this whole time uh
because i've just put my fucking mind
into the leg curls and fucking did
enough sets and enough failure proximity
my reps
to make it happen is so like you know
clearly if i can cut
and not lose any muscle or ability uh
you know you can
absolutely maintain the thing is what's
needed for maintenance is so
basic like i'll tell you this you can
maintain your arm size
for like a month doing only like
pull-ups and dips
like you don't even need isolation arm
movements like yeah a couple is a good
idea
but for hamstrings and quads and stuff
nah
yeah and i think like and i totally
agree with dr mike here and i think
there's also something to be said for
kind of your training age so if you're
somebody who has been training for a
long time and you've got big fucking
hamstrings that you've
earned uh you might find that you might
have some movements that are just you
just kind of keep
at least in the mix a little bit more
because they just work a little bit
better and uh
i find that like if you if you're
somebody who can you know stiff leg a
deadlift you know over 405 pounds
for reps you might need to keep a hip
hinge movement and a leg curl movement
just for fatigue purposes and for
deconditioning purposes
right so it's one of those things
whereas if you're kind of like a normal
intermediate male and maybe you're doing
you know sldl variants with like you
know 165 to 225 range like you're
probably good doing a 45 degree back
raise hamstring curls
hip hinge whatever any of those are fine
i think the more training aids you got
the more fussy some of those things will
become so you might end up having to
keep like one of both
potentially maybe maybe not um but i do
think as mike said
the requirements for maintenance under
normal conditions are so low it's it's
pretty hard to fuck up and at that point
it becomes more of a performance
monitoring thing
less of like a muscle maintenance thing
i think just because
your strength your strength is a skill
right and if you're not using that skill
in that particular movement then it's
going to decondition
et cetera yeah after your stuff looks
like another four or five plus and you
do only hamstring single leg curls for a
month coming back to that it's like
i don't know every now and again you
might need a break but unless you need a
break don't take it
antoine
thank you for the great content and
insights here is my question from a
purely hypertrophic standpoint
isn't the stiff legged deadlift
preferable in comparison
i read that weird in comparison a plain
old deadlift when it comes to full
glutes and hamstrings development
when would a person truly um purely
interested in hypertrophy choose the
deadlift over sld
well so for hamstrings absolutely for
glutes that's not clear to me at all
um glutes often respond to very high
force movements you can deadlift more
than you can stuff like a deadlift
the hamstrings are inappropriately done
stiff like a double the hamstrings are
every time the limiting factor not the
glutes
so again the glutes aren't really being
stimulated although in a regular device
the glutes can absolutely be a limiting
factor
and all you have to do is change the
deadlift into something in which the
glutes are really for sure the limiting
factor
uh which is a the best way to do that is
a deficit
sumo stiff-legged deadlift oh sorry
deficit sumo deadlift
uh and then all of a sudden it's a
fucking unbelievable glute exercise and
then you're good to go
uh the regular conventional deadlift is
like honestly there your spinal erectors
in
almost all people yeah is limiting
factor like if you had spinal erectors
it simply wouldn't quit
many people who currently deadlift two
to three hundred pounds would instantly
be able to develop like four or five
hundred pounds like it's
that big of a limiting factor uh which
is why people say like deadlifts for
back like yeah back is your limiting
factor on deadlifts almost all the time
but if you do something like sumo
deficits yeah your glutes are a living
factor and then you're well on your way
so glutes
no hamstrings yeah totally training
regular dell a deadlift for uh
hamstrings is like
really kind of dumb and nothing anyone
does in an advanced level
or your intermediate yeah and just to
play devil's advocate here a little bit
for discussion purposes i think when you
when you have somebody who's maybe like
a beginner and they're
going from beginner to intermediate you
could probably look at the regular
deadlift and just say well
it's just such a raw stimulus magnitude
exercise you're just getting overall
growth
everywhere so in terms of economy of
time
deadlift might be a good choice because
your hams get big your glutes get big
your quads get big your back gets big
like okay that's a pretty
great thing for a beginner but you know
everything's great for a beginner so at
that point we're kind of splitting hair
so i think once we're talking about the
intermediate athlete i think
everything that dr mike says completely
applies because then at that point
you have to be more specific in your
body part training yep
inti castro anti
like i n i n t i
oh that's another good name god amazing
he's got a cat picture yay i thought it
was a dolphin
an orca um all right no it's a cat i was
like wait is it
no it's yeah so uh really actually have
a very simple answer to this so the
question is
obliques to trainer uh to train them or
not for physique purposes also is there
any benefit to doing serratus focused
exercises
or will they be hit uh well with regular
training i have a real actually
super straightforward answers and i like
i i i'm not trying to wave my own flag
here but i love it when
your own brain or anyone's brain comes
up with a really eloquent answer to a
seemingly complex problem
because there's a lot of potential
answers to this but i think there's only
one really obvious easy answer or maybe
not obvious but easy super simple answer
here it is
get super fucking lean and see what you
look like if you want bigger obliques
as an artist then you train them same
goes for your serratus question
but before and until you get very very
very lean
like veins and striations and stuff like
that
uh you just don't know what your waist
is going to look like
and you might like it smaller with
smaller obliques or you might get
a waist so small that it looks like a
little feminine almost and some
sometimes guys without a lot of
muscularity in general they get a small
waist and they're like great i feel like
i could be fitted for a dress like i'm
gonna fucking man waist with those man
fucking
you know like the v though you know
whatever the brawny man
has uh like i want that and then train
obliques but you may
actually realize that a lot of people
especially a lot of you folks that
follow us and our subscribers channel
you do a lot of power lifting strength
stuff
a lot of motherfuckers have big ass
obliques just have no idea when you get
super lean like boom there they are
right um so i really just have to get
lean and find out james
yeah great answer um the those muscle
groups also just get a lot of indirect
work like the sarat i get a lot of
indirect work from like your pressing
and scapular heavy movements
your obliques actually get a lot of
indirect work from any of your trunk
heavy movements and any direct ab work
so if you're just training like regular
ab stuff you're actually getting a
little decent amount of oblique work in
there too not not to un but a little bit
so
what we find is that if you're generally
doing most kind of normal training
practices you're usually hitting those
sufficiently enough
indirectly to at least have a presence
and then as mike said
from that point on it's a matter of like
how much of it do you want
yup uh do you mind if i just shut my
dogs up real quick
yes uh carry on i'll i'm just gonna be
like a minute
okay so
good question from zimbor
interesting name um
zimbor asks wouldn't it make sense to
wear a lifting belt on most isolation
exercises when appropriate
for example barbara curls to limit
systemic fatigue and therefore allow a
greater amount of volume
surely the stimulation of the core gets
from movements like barbell curls is
quite worthless anyways
since the core has a huge rer barbell
curls compared to what the bicep
experiences at the end of a meso most
people have to deload due to systemic
fatigue
i wouldn't say most some and therefore
anything to lower systemic fatigue
during a measure would allow for more
volume in the muscles
groups and uh we are perhaps focusing on
drawing the meso during the uk lockdown
i have tested this
this is embarrassing to wear belts
isolations at the gym and i experienced
significantly less systemic fatigue
uh james we're on zimbor uh x-i-m-d-o-r
what the fuck right exactly zymbor
um uh wearing a belt on various
isolation movements for example curls
push down over her transfer extensions
lateral
etc so it's a really good point uh so
zimbor is talking about wearing a belt
on isolation stuff
if it manages to reduce systemic fatigue
because the stuff for the core is just
not
worthwhile because it's so low or ir and
stuff it's a very good point it's
definitely something to consider
that the uh contrary opinion would be
that you may not actually lower systemic
fatigue at all
because putting on a belt doesn't lower
systemic fatigue
it just lets you get further closer to
rir
of the actual muscles that you're
training so for example
you may stop curling because your core
gets tired but if you have a belt on
you may get more curl reps which
actually would result in pretty much the
same amount of systemic fatigue
but more of that fatigue directed and
more stimulus directed to your biceps
so put it another way if your core is it
all a limiting factor
in how many reps you can get and your
performance on biceps triceps shoulders
etc
you should absolutely use a belt or at
least consider it you guys will notice
um
now that i do super round laterals i
don't wear a belt anymore but back when
i did a lot of regular laterals i think
i got up to like the 55s for 720 or
something like that with like stroke
laterals
um i was wearing a belt every single
time the people like why the belt dock
and like you pick up the 55s and fucking
try to lateral raise them
if you put on a belt you're just so much
stronger you can do
more lateral raising with good technique
and then the actual rar you get to the
shoulder muscles is much lower
and the systemic fatigue is for me
probably higher
with the belt because i can push my body
so much further my core doesn't give out
because the core doesn't really give out
stomach fatigue wise it's just like
you're done like i'm not even i'm not
stable enough to get you going here
so i think it's less of a systemic
fatigue issues and more i think it's
more of an issue of are you pushing the
muscles
that you are targeting very close to
failure if you're doing 90 pounds on the
cable tricep extension and you're a
woman or something or 60 pounds
and you put on a belt we take it off
nothing happens sweet don't wear a belt
if you're on the hack squat and you wear
a belt or not and it increases your rep
account by five in each set
or lateral raises or upright rows or
anything you've got a real good argument
for wearing a belt and i think a lot of
the
really big ifbb pros the jared just
farted legitimately in my face
piece of shit um yeah it's awful post
his post contest he turned pro yeah he's
post contest so he's fine
um so basically uh you know a lot of the
pros and really big bodybuilders they
wear belts on a lot of isolation shit
and probably because they feel like they
can just do better
that's the real answer to why uh wearing
a boat may be a good idea and
if it's one of those things where you
put it on it feels cosmetic it doesn't
improve your performance then you can
feel free to take it off because it's
not doing shit for you it's like guys
james you ever see there like old guys
for some reason do this a lot
they'll wear a belt in training and
they'll walk around with it they'll
never unclip or
re-flip and you're like you know if you
never unclip your belt i can tell you
for a fact it's not tight enough to do
dick to improve your performance
so absolutely one of those guys and some
people that's that's enough of a reason
not to wear the belt
because it's it's just so constricting
and so distracting
uh that's a very good case you could
make even if it did help you eke out
maybe a couple of reps here or there it
ends up just being this massive
distraction for you the whole time
don't wear it another thing that people
will do is that they'll assume that
like before let's just take an example
where they'll say like oh well i heard
dr mike mention this this lateral raise
thing so i'm going to give that a go
and they put a belt on and then sure
enough they had a performance increase
from their lateral races and they'll say
well that means that my core
is really weak i should be able to do
these lateral raises without
any kind of assisted device and then
they'll spend a whole lot of time doing
core stuff which
ends up just being a waste of time so in
this case i would say sorry i'm trying
to get a good angle here the sun is like
blasting through it oh no worries i'm
trying to
there we go let's try this um some
people will use that as a
kind of like a justification for saying
you need to do more core work which is
really just a
an excuse to do a bunch of bullshit and
not actually train hard
so totally totally
so don't do that
next up samuel turner
i'll have a samuel turner there is an
adult film star named
paige turner oh
paige turner like a dirt herder yeah
exactly
like a fucking dirty mag in it i believe
she's
she's from the you know a kingdom all
right
the uk brav samuel turner says how come
when you become advanced
elite and you stop training your
baseline is much bigger than what you
were prior without training what is
going on
well actually i would go to stronger by
science ragnuckel's website
and write a read his latest um
discussion of a big review that came out
on uh
muscle memory which is your ability of
your muscles to sort of bounce back
quicker or never get that much smaller
after you train him a certain amount
turns out my nuclear domain and
satellite cell addition have some role
to play probably a big one
but there's other factors the nervous
system probably is heavily involved in a
bunch of other stuff
but through an agglomeration of multiple
factors
even when you lose muscle your ability
to rebuild it
is greater if you've built a ton of it
and kept it for a while
and losing muscle is harder when you
become more advanced just like losing
skill is some of that stuff just sticks
around
maybe not forever but for a long long
long time
months years some some of it decades
it's like a sliding scale of what sticks
around for how long
so that's really the answer is there's a
bunch of biology that's designed to do
two things one keep you in pretty decent
shape if you've ever gotten a really
good shape and held it for a while
and two allow for you to uh get that
shape back
way faster if you've ever gotten it
before which is like funny because you
see some pro bodybuilders who take some
time off three or four years
they look like whatever they're like
these are big guys but they're like way
out of shape and they're like what
got a 20 week prep for you know the
first pro show and you're like what 20
weeks my ass motherfucking
10 years and in uh 10 weeks later they
post a progress photo you're like
you look like what and it's like a
steroids like i don't know men people
take steroids before it still takes them
10 years to get that big
how's this guy doing it well there's
latent sort of quote unquote muscle
memory that is a really really big deal
tons of tons of mechanisms some of which
i mentioned many of which are currently
being discovered tons of which will
to be discovered but it's a big deal and
it's a real real effect
yeah and sometimes we kind of joke about
like people having old man strength for
example
that's an example of something where you
have somebody who has accumulated muscle
mass throughout their whole lifetime but
they've also
been adapting to that muscle mass over a
very long period of time that's why
grandpa can fucking take a whole barrel
full of you know rocks or sand and just
move it himself where normally
somebody else would ask for help why
well
slowly over time like grandpa's been
accumulating strength
nervous system strength muscle mass and
the changes that intertwine between
those two things
and he's also been probably adjusting
their lifestyle so if you have gained a
lot of muscle over your lifestyle
you're just more inclined to do things
in your activities daily living that are
more
strength demanding because it's easy for
you to do it and that's another reason
why you don't lose it so instead of
you can move the trash can so you do
move the trash cans exactly that seems
like such a minor thing but it's one of
those things like
go back and look at your life like i
know i do this all the time where
i was cutting a tree that had fell
falling down and my neighbor was like
fuck this thing's going to be a pain in
the ass to move i was like watch this
and i just moved it he looked at me like
what the fuck's wrong with you i was
like dude
i'm jacked like what do you think right
and you can just do stuff like that and
you don't think about it you just do it
and that's just that's just how your
life becomes so it's one of those things
too where
your activities and the things that you
do in your life start to be
more conducive of the strength and
muscle mass that you have and you don't
lose it because it becomes kind of more
of a routine thing
jr not a question this is just a real
quick comment i had to
screen cap says
where are jace j space r oh damn it
got him dr james
burp compilation intro i've been better
i've been better
i got scolded i got in trouble with with
with
big papa yeah stop
burping hey hold on there was another
funny one that i saw i think it was at
the bottom oh yeah steve tate
your aussie accents are an abomination
what's funny is he probably sounds like
exactly how we fucking do an aussie
exactly we're we usually shoot for more
of like the queensland
brisbane kind of thing ever not like you
yeah steve's probably from melbourne
he's like
my butler doesn't speak like this i need
some fresh coffee
yeah they love their coffee in melbourne
um all right
scott the scott
got scott got what
i don't know let me let me see how his
name is spelled again
got it scott sco scott p got actually
after
there it is dear mike and james i have a
question about lap pull downs i have
given them up for a little while because
i didn't feel they were productive no my
muscle connection pump etc recently
added them back in after some form
changes i'm now getting some eye muscle
connection it's really good
the issue i'm running into is that at
any reasonable weight the first seven
eighths of the movement
flies and i have trouble getting the bar
down to my chest maybe the last two
inches with
no slowdown of the rest of the movement
my hands are about 1.5
x shoulder width apart pronated pull the
bar to the bottom of my sternum and
leaning back about 30 degrees
i keep hearing mike's words in my head
that if i can't do full rom that i just
need to get stronger okay they've
actually never seriously said that but
we'll get on to that a sec
but i guess i'm wondering if that very
last part of the movement was a
different muscle or different part of
the muscle it can be trained in
isolation
or is it really just a matter of keeping
a lighter weight uh until i can complete
the pull down with full round
consistently
i'm thinking of getting a mag grip and
changing to a neutral grip to see if
that helps
so i wouldn't chase rom like that like a
crazy thing so ram is designed to
increase your sfr
and most of the time it does if ram
really reduces your sfr it's too much
rum
um and that's totally fine just make
sure you're not ignoring an entire part
of a movement
so what you might want to do is this
continue to do your current
technique stopping the bar an inch or so
or two inches above your sternum and
getting badass
lat sfr awesome and then maybe every now
and again maybe at the end
throw in one or two sets of much lighter
load
where you go all the way down to your
sternum or your chest and you pause and
hold the bar for two or three seconds
and then you let go and come up and then
pause and hold and squeeze that make
sure you train those squeezing pausing
muscles because it could be slightly
different muscles or different parts
of muscles you check them off the list
but it doesn't interfere with you
training
the predominant uh large swath of your
lats which the lat pull downs are
designed to train
so no religion here and if your sfr is
not great with full rom partial raw may
be the better choice that was good so i
got immediately distracted because i
read the sentence that says the first
seven to eight
of the movement flies and yeah you can
see where my brain is because i
i had had a fly problem in the house
that i've been dealing with and i was
like yeah those fucking flies get in the
way
fuck those flies and i was thinking
about them doing lap pulldowns and like
flies distracting him
had nothing to do with what he was
actually talking about i just had like
flies on the brain and i read that and i
was like yeah those fucking flies get
them
well i suppose my analysis is decent
yeah
yeah no really good i think many people
have especially like if you alter
a lot of people will do you know their
their typical lat pull down will be like
two kind of like chin
level and then they might hear somebody
like dr mike talking about full rom and
they might change their technique to
lat pull down to like sternum and they
start doing that and they can
they can only do like five of the 15
reps that they plan to do at that range
of motion and act surprised like
am i just weak like what's going on and
it's literally another
uh kind of a specificity issue where you
just you haven't trained
the muscle at that terminal end of that
range of motion and so you really
don't have any functional strength there
you will once you start doing it
um it doesn't mean that you're
necessarily weak on like a holistic
standpoint it just means
it's just something you haven't done
like it's one of those it's the same
thing as saying like
well i can juggle two balls but i
haven't juggled three balls and when i
try to juggle three balls it's really
it's really hard but of course it's hard
you haven't done it yet right it's just
just it's
you can literally think of it very much
like a skill and that you haven't
rehearsed that same movement throughout
that same range and as you increase the
range it gets harder that's why like
classic example same problem exact same
problem
person squats to parallel and you say
why don't you try going all the way down
they break parallel with the weight that
they can normally handle and they bomb
apart yeah they fall apart why because
they haven't trained that range of
motion could they
if they had a couple weeks under their
belt sure right same idea here
so don't be discouraged if you're having
that issue where
the range of motion feels kind of wonky
when you get to the bottom just keep
practicing and as mike said
the lighter sets with the peak
contraction and like
slow eccentric coming out of the bottom
man can really make a big difference and
all of a sudden
you'll start getting a few more reps
week after week after week on your top
sets
and then next thing you know after a
while it's just not a thing anymore
you're doing full range of motion pull
downs without having to think about it
yeah yep yep yep as doc stone would say
notepad is up next and this is just a
funny comment i had to throw in there
and we have an outer question after this
notepad two words
ah oh here it is
oh no our docs made me amused to know
that kino body one of my very favorite
personalities in all the fitness youtube
and probably there's two from the sound
of their immediately tickled reaction
uh uh heavy sarcasm there also says that
big quads look rounded and feminine
and that his program will give you
thinner less developed more masculine
legs
uh that he has uh and that women so
adore
uh you know what i'm saying you gotta
tell yourself what you got to tell
yourself
i mean skinny legs yeah like man
i hate the whole man card i don't
develop legs but like
that motherfucker be given that man card
uh give it to someone with big legs
jesus christ pussy pussiest shit i've
ever heard in my fucking life
oh man each their own to each their own
yeah yeah
hate it hate hate all right last stop is
andrew atkinson
got it uh our last question for the day
andrew asks hi docs what considerations
would you give
when increasing the number of sessions
per week from say four sessions to five
or six
so my first consideration is to make
sure you only ever go up by one
so don't go from four to six only ever
go four to five and do at least one
mesocycle to see how that works
second consideration is make sure your
exercises are alignments that your way
that they don't interfere with one
another
you might have never had any sort of
rear dot recovery problems because you
did back then reared off the back of the
rear delts
you added another session that's another
session of rear dots and all of a sudden
your next back workout you're like oh my
god my rear delts are feeling like
really sore and tired what the hell
ah shit they haven't healed and then
they have back and forth tobacco
rebounds so you really have to go in
and look at your program that you're
making and make sure there's not a ton
of overlapping
fatigue situations where you get
overlapping soreness overlapping
performance reduction so on and so forth
that is my two big recommendations that
i would start out with um
james what do you think what else you
got yeah this one might be kind of
obvious and goes without saying for many
people but always
start a new mesocycle with the
adjustments don't do it midway
through the mesocycle that you're
currently in start anew
and preferably in an ideal situation
start a new block
at that point finish out whatever you've
been doing well
i mean i understand you might be at a
point where you're like i've been doing
four days i want to go up to
five days and i have the time to do it
now so why should i take a little active
rest
yeah why should i sit around and wait
that's fair enough um i think in an
ideal situation
you'd be able to track it as like a
clean slate brand new clean slate in a
more practical
sense just wait until you finish out the
current message cycle and then switch
over
and also like if you've done multiple
messengers pretty hard of like four
and you go up to five and your five
doesn't work because it's too fatiguing
maybe it wasn't the five that was too
fatigued maybe it would have if it was
four it would have still been too
fatigued because you just need an active
rest so it's really good to clean the
slate and really be like okay it's like
when you're tasting different foods
you like actually like food tasting is a
real thing
you wash out your mouth between tastings
with water or whatever as you're
drinking
because you don't want one food to spill
into the other and be like oh that mac
and cheese sure has all tasted like
onions like that's cause you had an
onion dish right before idiot like
okay i guess you're right so make sure
you really do a clean slate if you want
to
not just benefit but find out okay is
this something sustainable is it
something i can benefit i've done many
times in my adult life
i was already dr mike and supposedly all
smart shit about training
many conclusions i've come to were wrong
because it was just the spillover
effects of a previous phase
yeah totally i've done wine tasting
before and you know they give you a
little thing to spit the wine out
damn motherfucker i don't spit that out
i just drink it i'm here to get drunk
they're like how's it taste like like
wine i hate him taste shitty i'm here to
get drunk
what do you call it it tastes like uh
like like bread that's gone bad or
something
pea bread p bread there's james's big
wine endorsement
i'm like a fucking sommelier over here
what does this go good with anything
that tastes like pee
yeah you really are man of culture
all right folks that's all we have james
any announcements
uh no no no that was a fun one there was
a bunch of really fun questions um
i've been working on the content
feedback that i've been getting from
jake jake had a bunch of really good
edits for me so far so i'm continuing to
work on
that um on my book well
that's about it over here mike how about
you that's it
working on the last little bits of the
uh the hypertrophy book and that should
be out in a few weeks
oh yeah okay uh question for you about
that after
let's wrap up for now though okay uh
folks keep sending in those questions
make sure you guys like any comments
that you think are great um and then
we'll be sure to answer them every
single time
