hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
today's topic is should you eat tasty
foods on a
fat loss diet i mean the answer to
should you eat tasty foods at all is
duh but the fat loss diet presents a
couple of
interesting quirks and we're going to
talk about the power of the food
palatability reward hypothesis what the
hell is that
science i was going to say a swear word
but the youtube algorithm doesn't like
that
science stuff we'll swear later when
youtube can't hear us anymore
stupid machine learning
replacing taking our jobs he's going to
swear again after that
again i can't do it leave all that in
please
all right what are we going to talk
about specifically a couple things
first we're going to talk about the
purpose and mechanism of how fat loss
dieting happens
after that we'll talk about some upsides
of eating tastier foods than you would
normally eat
on your diet then we're going to talk
about the downsides of trying to do that
now we're going to talk about the very
advanced sort of emergent topic
of actually adjusting your food taste to
hunger and cravings a lot of really good
stuff there
and lastly how to individualize the
process so that you personally
get the most results out of it so here's
the deal
the purpose of a fat loss phase
is to lose fat okay now i know that
sounds crazy
but i can explain why am i saying this
because a lot of folks
will start a fat loss phase this may be
their first time at organized dieting or
maybe the 10th
and it's easy to get lost in thinking
okay like
i i love eating tasty foods i'm gonna
focus on that and i guess to lose fat
but
if you don't keep the eye on the prize
you can start doing a lot of weird stuff
that just has all of the cultural
elements of fat loss without the big key
ingredient of actually losing fat
remember the purpose is to lose fat it's
not to eat as tasty as foods as possible
it's not the challenge to make diet food
as tasty as possible is to lose fat
it is not to challenge yourself on the
other end with eating a crap ton of
bland food
some people will eat the blandest crap
ever hate the whole diet
and they're like oh i wish i could eat
tastier stuff but it's a diet bro you
got to do what it takes like
we just got to be losing fat which means
well preview you've got to be at a
deficit
and if you're doing that it doesn't
matter how tasty the foods are unless
they affect you in some other way
right so people get caught up in both
extremes of trying to eat super tasty
food or trying to stay the hell away
from it
for no good reason and then it's just
like look it's a fat loss phase the
purpose is to lose fat and lastly
it's not a fat loss lifestyle that
doesn't make any sense if you had a fat
loss lifestyle you would die when you
lost all your fat and body weight
you know several years in it's just a
phase it's temporary
eventually you go back to maintenance
where you you eat much more normally
so anything we're going to be
recommending in this fat loss phase is
temporary for the fat loss phase it
really really bears to remember that
when you're dieting
sometimes it's pretty hard now the
mechanism to which we use to accomplish
fat loss
is a hypocaloric diet which is where our
problems start to happen
by definition it is not enough food
which means
that your hunger and cravings levels all
almost every time
go up over time no matter who you are
now they might not ever go up for you
to a concerning level and sometimes
people start diets at a pretty
concerning level
but hunger and cravings is just a matter
of time for them to creep in
it's like if you're running 10 miles if
you're in unbelievable shape
fatigue will creep in a little bit and
you'll get a little slower if you're in
terrible shape you might not even run 10
miles
but it's a fact that as anyone runs 10
miles
their fatigue goes up same idea as you
go through a diet you will because it's
never fundamentally enough food
by definition right you're losing body
mass your body's hormones are going
help start eating more what the hell is
wrong with you right that's what they're
designed for it's designed
as energy regulators to make sure you
don't lose an inordinate amount of
weight
you forget to eat all the time you're
never really hungry you'll eventually
disappear enough
right the longer you diet
the leaner you get and leaner you start
in many cases
the higher the hunger and cravings will
eventually get
right and the thing is is that adherence
to the diet how much you can stick to
the diet
is huge in a fat loss diet and a lack of
adherence can absolutely destroy any
results
you guys know the stereotype and it's
true the weekday diet weekend question
mark
weekend binge it doesn't matter there's
nobody in heaven giving out stamps for
how many
monday through fridays you did well in
your diet it doesn't matter if your week
overall
is not at a deficit because you ate 10
pizzas on saturday and sunday
you're not losing any fat you're not
losing any weight you're going to fail
and if the hunger and cravings are why
you failed we got to do something about
them
because they're not really going away we
just have to manage them somehow in a
really good way now here's the deal
you might not crack or you might have
just iron willpower
and all the way through your diet you
never cracked and you never cheated and
you lost all the weight however
hunger and cravings are psychologically
really nuisanceum
they generate plenty of cortisol plenty
of other fight-or-flight responses
and tons of stress they're independent
stressors okay
any given situation of training food
lifestyle
add you're hungry all the time to that
same situation just hungry let's say we
give you a magic pill to reduce hunger
and they do exist
right they're not magic but they do
exist all of a sudden
your stress levels are going to be lower
if you're not experiencing hunger the
less hunger and cravings you experience
the less stress you have and stress
affects your sleep it affects your
hormones it affects your training
responses
so if you can find a way to eat that
doesn't allow
radical hunger and cravings to ever
enter your diet even if you're strong
enough psychologically to take it
and not cheat it's that much better
because then you're not
under as much stress and physically you
lose more fat
your performance is upheld the better
you sleep better and you lose less
muscle
those are all pluses so
tasty diet foods let's say that we want
to eat lots of
tasty foods on our fat loss diet and
somehow fit them into our macros so
not a discussion of the do they fit
macros for sure let's say they do
what are the upsides couple really good
ones first of all they're really fun to
make
right people like to control their diet
journey they like to decide what they
eat
and if you're making a bunch of food
that's really fun to eat and fun to
prepare
you're going to have a really good time
a lot of times this creates buying
if you're just eating regular bland crap
that somebody else told you to eat it
doesn't seem like you're in charge of
your diet and you're like yeah i'm doing
somebody's diet that they told me to do
but if you start to figure out really
fun recipes and really cool little
tricks and you make tasty foods
you're like this is my diet i own it i'm
in charge and all of a sudden
you're bought in and you're doing that
much better your adherence is that much
higher awesome
next point tasty foods are fun to eat
okay at the end of the day uh if you
diet for three months
you know and you're just miserable that
entire time the results are cool but
you're also miserable for three
finite fucking months of your life where
you know you can go back and be like man
i wish i wasn't miserable that time
and someone tells you you could have
lost just the same amount of fat eating
tasty foods
you'd be like what damn it
like i thought i was supposed to eat
clean and eat like oatmeal with no sugar
or no artificial sweetener no salt and
just have to just
smash dry oatmeal into my face and
nobody told me i could get lean
eating actually a lot of foods that
taste good it would suck right so if you
can have the same amount of fun
doing something with the same results
that's probably a good idea
right in addition to that for many
people if a diet is fun and you get to
eat a lot of tasty foods it's more
likely to stick to it
like if you get to eat like lower
calorie versions of the same tasty foods
you always ate like it could be a
delicious diet
and you're like two and a half months in
and someone's like pretty miserable huh
dieting right eating a lot of broccoli
and chicken and you're like actually no
no i feel great and i've lost 10 pounds
that can be a reality so there's a big
upside there
and to that point lots of tasty
lower calorie options can really make a
fat loss diet
feel like a maintenance diet like
someone's like so your fat loss huh
you're just
restricted to just you know steak and
sweet potato huh and you're like
actually i had a low calorie pizza
um i had some ice cream so for example
enlightened ice cream which is
amazing it doesn't taste like regular
ice cream i'm not gonna lie to you
but you know what when you're dieting a
little bit hungry and cravier
shit tastes good as fuck and you really
can't tell the difference
mid diet did you have these hazy
memories of ice cream tasting good
but right now enlighten taste they're
damn good and it's like a quarter like
literally a quarter or half
of the calories of regular ice cream it
is packed with protein and fiber and
you're like what
like if someone said like look you can
fit two cartons of enlightened ice cream
into every day of your diet and just
lose fat
you like no nonsense ice cream isn't for
me be like are you sure
you try it you're like there's a trick
here right there's no trick
right so if you can manage to eat
essentially like you were
on maintenance but trade some of the
foods in for lower calorie options
uh good god like you're winning at life
so there's a huge upside here so we
don't just want to snub our nose with
the drake thing like
right we don't want to do that for uh
foods that taste good
because potentially we can just have all
the foods we taste good you know
the little diet versions of them but
still damn good except
you know we can have an awesome for
example just as a really super example
of no
um distinct uh pre-packaged foods
someone says okay you're on a diet you
tell someone and they're like okay
so we're gonna go to lunch where do you
go to like like a special health food
store do we need it at home you're like
no we can go to chipotle and they're
like
ah i thought you were on a diet you're
like yeah
i usually order a buttload of guac
cheese and sour cream
what i do now is i order half guac no
cheese no sour cream but i still get the
steak beans blob line i have an awesome
delicious burrito look yeah i'm not
gonna lie to you
it's not the burrito the end all
burritos because the sour cream and the
cheese are missing
right but you put a little more corn
salsa in there the calories fit the
macros fit and you're still eating
burritos for the love of god
so if you didn't know that that was an
option which
so many people don't you'd be like no
can't go to chipotle i got to go to just
the whole food top bar and get the cubed
dry
cold chicken and eat that with brown
rice that's an option for sure we'll
talk about in just a bit but if you
don't have to take that option why would
you right lastly this is a small concern
but nonetheless a thing
especially for bigger bodybuilders
sometimes at the beginning of their
diets especially
they have to eat so much clean food that
it's just hard to get it all in
if you start a bodybuilding diet eating
like 700 grams of carbs from brown rice
you are going to be looking down the
barrel of a gun within several days like
i can't do this anymore
i can't even and you start under eating
which is bad because you want to keep
your metabolism nice and high
keep your hunger nice and low and build
some muscle at the beginning of your
diet if you're eating more tasty foods
at the beginning of a diet
then you not under eating at all and
you're setting yourself up for a later
uh part of the diet where you have to
eat less because you're not hungry your
metabolism is fire in all cylinders and
when you have to cut the food to lose a
bit more fat you have
tons of food to cut from you didn't just
go there earlier because you couldn't
stuff yourself with oatmeal too much
all right those are the upsides now as
always there are downsides
so here we go first this is especially
if you feel like you have to eat tasty
foods on a diet okay some of these
downsides become apparent someone told
you like i
have wham you got to eat candy bars on
your fat loss diet or else you're not
hashtag science and you're like okay got
it first
downsides of tasty diet foods they can
be tough to prepare
okay like some of the stuff like
requires you cooking and
flavoring food and fuck that like you
can just eat brown rice and plain
chicken it'll be totally fine but you
have to
start cooking stuff especially like you
have a lower bandwidth when you're in a
fat loss diet towards the end you're
like oh we have to do extra stuff i
don't know about that right so downside
number one
downside number two some of them are
expensive to buy look look i'm a huge
enlightened fan the shit is not
cheap it's not free it is not cheap it's
not terribly expensive but damn you know
it dents the wallet a little bit
and so do a lot of the diet foods so
that's a thing right you if you just
eat uh you know regular diet foods a ton
a lot of time they're super super cheap
like to buy bulk white rice or brown
rice at the store oh my god that's damn
near free
but if you start buying like all these
like super protein packed pancake mixes
yeah it can cost you a pretty penny next
and here's the huge kicker and the
central organizing principle behind this
entire presentation
tasty foods in a deficit can
radically increase hunger and cravings
what that sounds backwards but the
research backs it up
one thousand percent the easiest analogy
homology it's actually an example is
try eating one potato chip if you
really didn't want hunger and cravings
honest question
would you eat zero potato chips you got
two hours you're in a laboratory
scientists are measuring your brain and
shit and they're trying to measure
hunger and cravings let's say they
can electrodes in you and they actually
can tell what you think um
and if you're hungry or you know or a
craving and
then you know they're like do you want
one potato chip for the next two hours
and then you're free to go or do you
want zero
and you're like okay what's the trick
they're like we want to see you know
you're trying to keep your hunger and
cravings as low as possible
what would your answer be the correct
answer in almost every case is
keep those potato chips the fuck away
from me because if i have one of them
shits
i get i want more right it's like you
walk into
um for folks who happen to be hispanic
this won't work for you as well because
you're used to it
but you walk into a hispanic friend's
house and that that
maybe their mom or aunt or something is
cooking mexican
food or guatemalan food or something
that shit hits your nose
i want to eat everything i'm going to
fucking start eating the furniture
shit's also goddamn good
why did i walk into this house right and
if you eat a little bit
oh my god it's tough to stop so
in a lot of cases eating some tasty food
makes you want more think about fast
food how many people have half a
cheeseburger and then put it down what
like if i'm going to mcdonald's i'm
fighting ronald mcdonald for the title
you feel me
because the food is good and i want to
eat a ton of it that is not the case
with food that is bland
okay if you walk into a mcdonald's and
fucking bizarro world
and they're like here is plain brown
rice
steamed broccoli and slices of chicken
breast you're like
whoo cheat meal and you eat it
and someone's like watching ether you
don't you just want more of it you're
like no
i didn't want any of it to begin with
right bland food that doesn't taste that
great does not
cause a an increase in cravings as
you're eating it
tasty food does if and that's
hold up and that's in a maintenance
condition okay you can eat more food
when it's tasty in a maintenance
condition
what happens in a hypochloric fat loss
diet condition
is just insanity and if any of you have
experienced that it's the real deal
you get a potato chip try fit into your
macros
deep into a fat lost diet you're like
then all of a sudden you wake up covered
in potato chips
severed heads clown bodies it's good you
killed clowns along the way at least you
did a
good human service and you have no idea
where you were i blacked out
right shit is so good tasty food is so
good especially in a fat loss diet
if you eat it you have to resist
mondo cravings in order to stop which is
a stressor
if you don't eat it out of sight out of
mind it doesn't really bother you so
there's a huge downside
to taking that tasty diet food way too
far because if you include a ton of
tasty food in your diet
as you're dieting you're almost
enhancing your misery on purpose
i'm gonna make i'm gonna make a really
shitty analogy
that's gonna it's gonna uh catch me here
it's not professional but i guess it's
youtube so hopefully it'll slip away
if you were gonna do something stupid
like try not to
try to be celibate including jacking off
for like 40 days remember that dumbass
movie from the early 2000's four days
four nights whatever josh hartner
he's dreamy if you were to try doing
nothing sexual
for 40 days let's see would you
look at a ton of porn and sort of start
doing sexual stuff and then back off or
would you just push that shit the fuck
away from you it's out of sight out of
mind if the answer is obvious
and to some extent deep in a diet that
same thing can happen with tasty foods
i hope that shit goes through i can't
even the youtube comments on this are
going to be completely insane people are
going to
think this is a porn video uh they're
going to
know what it's about but in any case i
hope that i hope you guys uh hope that
made some sense so now
we have this nasty combination that ends
up happening point a
from the last slide food is fun to make
okay
combined with point c here which is
increase in hunger and cratings
due to the food palatability reward
hypothesis right
combines into potentially a kind of an
obsessive element about food
you end up anticipating eating these
tasty meals you can't wait to craft and
you've got them in your fridge and oh my
god tomorrow's gonna be amazing
right and you're hoping and planning and
there's anxiety
like okay at 3 pm i get my awesome super
amazing ice cream meal that i made
and it's like 2 55 and you're like
and then three weeks from now you're
like 3 p.m meal what time is it it's
like it's 12 15 you're like ah
it feels like 2 59 right it can really
really get nasty
and the worst part is towards the end of
this phase
you get into a place where you're barely
even enjoying the food as you're eating
it because you're going so fast because
it's so tasty you can't stop
you barely even ironically tasting it at
this point
and when the meal is done you're like
where'd it go and then you're kind of a
little bit depressed afterwards and you
then the anxiety and the hoping and the
dreaming starts for the next meal
it's a bad deal it's a bad deal you
might not want
anything to do with right you what you
might want to do is back a little bit
away from that whole process
so how do we do this how do we adjust
our food intake specifically with regard
to taste
to our hunger and cravings here's the
deal at the beginning of a fat loss diet
you can probably eat as many tasty foods
as you like because you're just not that
hungry and fat loss is easy weight loss
is easy no big deal
and at this point you can try to be
creative and try to make normal foods
fit into your diet or try some
low fat recipes so on and so forth right
and the longer here's the kicker the
longer you can diet and not feel like
it's a fat loss diet you don't feel
super restricted you're not eating a
bunch of really bland foods
the better because you can get like 12
week diet you can get six weeks in
and still be eating fundamentally
awesome foods and oh my god you just got
six weeks done
with almost no effort amazing right
during that time especially towards the
middle of a diet
you got to start paying attention to
your hunger and cravings as the diet
goes on for weeks and weeks they'll
probably start to rise
and when they start to rise no big deal
but at some point they're going to be
more of a positive or sorry more of a
negative
than a positive it used to be that you
looked forward
to your little rice and chicken
concoction with all these herbs and
spices
and afterwards you felt satiated and
you're like oh this is so great i get to
eat my favorite foods
this fills me up i'm not craving for
three hours after and then i get to eat
another one of those meals
at some point in your diet this will
shift at the pluses and minuses outweigh
each other
and what ends up happening is you start
to get like really anxious for that and
then you go through it really quick
and at the end you're like i just want
more of it
yikes i'm gonna have to call an audible
and say this is too good to handle for
me for now
because i don't i can't get more of it
because i'm intentionally hyper caloric
when that negative overwhelms the
positive
you can try to blanden up your food a
little that's not a word bland enough
fuck it i made it up get your food a
little bit more bland
you can do this in a sort of progressive
manner you can do it all at once food by
food your call
so you can do a little bit less
flavoring for your little rice and
chicken concoction or you can take all
the flavoring out and just leave in the
salt
sometimes you can even reduce the salt
to some extent so
essentially you use flavorings and tasty
cooking methods and maybe some of the
specialty stuff like
the low-fat ice cream what do you do
instead
why don't you stop eating food you eat
more voluminous food you eat less tasty
foods
so for example here you eat a plate of
raw or steamed veggies with brown rice
with plain chicken versus like white
rice with spices
grilled veggies and super grilled
chicken that you got some thai recipe or
something like that like
eat more of the blander stuff and all of
a sudden you'll get back to that place
you were early in the diet where you're
like
pretty excited for food why excited
because you're fucking hungry because
you're deep into a diet
you eat the food and you know it's
pretty tough to eat all of it because
it's really bland but at the end you're
like oh
i'm fairly well satisfied in an ideal
world of course i would just get to eat
more tasty food
but like you know i'm pretty much done
and then you're not hungry for the next
three hours until your next meal
super right now when the fat loss diet
ends completely at the end do you want
to just jump into super crazy tasty food
no ideally you don't you can but
ideally what you do is you just re
re-walk that
ramp that hedonic staircase you start
walking back up
nice and slow so when your night ends
you go immediately and this would be
another video at some point
from a fat loss phase into a maintenance
phase at least if not a surplus let's
just say maintenance
that's a big ass difference in calories
right your mate is a little lower than
it was before but still pretty high my
recommendation is to add all those
calories back in in clean food
whatever blandness of food you're eating
on average add that in
after a week or two of that so first of
all you're going to love it because
oh my god i get less food look at all
those brown rice and someone's like damn
you are
fucking over diet and you're excited for
brown rice and broccoli like i know it's
crazy right
but now you get a bunch of it you're not
hungry for two weeks you're not hungry
and then because your metabolism is
speeding back up
and your hormones are all doing better
and better at the end of that two weeks
you're gonna be like
man you're gonna have like trying to eat
one of these brown rice meals you're
gonna get
three quarters of the way through it
would be like okay i'm gonna do this
shit anymore i physically can't eat any
more of this i'll throw up
and then at that point you're like oh
how do i eat all this food that i'm
supposed to
i'm gonna make it tastier and then you
flavor it up a little bit a little bit
more
and then maybe six weeks out of the rest
of your diet after you're done diet
recovery phase
then you're back eating the same tasty
food you always were except you're down
15 pounds of body fat
success and you never had a huge rebound
it's tough to pull off in real life but
it absolutely worked
i've done it a whole bunch so
individualizing the process lastly
you don't have to do any of this stuff
at all
okay some people can have tasty foods in
moderation no problem through
any kind of diet some people if you just
say that of no tasty foods even the last
four weeks you say all bland foods
because you're really freaking out
they will crack and sometimes just one
piece of candy here and there
floats them okay abstainers versus
moderators it's a thing
some people can't diet at all on tasty
foods because if they just get a whiff
they just go crazy
all right and everything in between
so all we want you to do is give the
ideas a little bit of thought
try elements of them if you like make
your diet food a little bit tastier at
the front end when you're not super
hungry you have to eat more food
and when you have to challenge yourself
by eating less food because a
hypochloric condition has to be
maintained
as your hunger and cravings rise give
some thought to maybe making the food a
little bit blander
so that you can have a better time
dieting and accomplish all of your goals
folks thanks for tuning in see you next
time
you
