hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization strength training made
simple video number seven
how hard should you be training for
optimum strength
results well first of all what does the
research say research is limited it's
mostly in undergraduates mostly on
beginners
some on advanced but it's good to sort
of ground ourselves in our research and
then work from there to more advanced
conclusions
so it shows that going all out all the
way to failure
super grinding shows no clear benefit
just yet maybe ever over going hard
but with a little bit of force in
reserve either reps in reserve
or if you're doing a certain number of
reps maybe you could have lifted a
little bit more weight
so not going all out but going super
hard
probably comparable at least as research
can tell now to going all out so this
idea that we have to go all out every
time
probably not true now
more bad news for going all out we do
know pretty well that going all out
max effort on every set lifting as much
weight for a set of three as you can
or you know you have a potential four to
eight rep max on the bar and you do all
eight reps and you can't do any more
something like that if you do that
all the time it causes a crap ton of
fatigue
now we already know it probably doesn't
cause a whole lot more stimulus but way
more fatigue it's probably not the best
way
to have the best long-term training
because it prevents you from stringing
together
the most productive workouts in a row
the way you really get stronger
is you have a great workout and you have
a great workout and you have a great
workout and you get stronger and
stronger and stronger
if you have an amazing workout that
fatigues the crap out of you
maybe you'll have a good workout after
but then the fatigue starts to add up
and you have a bad workout or you have
to take a deload and it disrupts that
process you want to build momentum by
training hard
but not so excessively hard you fry
everything and have to take
one step back for every one and a half
steps forward that you take
so how can we make sure
that we're training first of all hard
enough
and also not too hard because we know
that training way away from your limits
absolutely doesn't result in the best
strength uh abilities if you're leaving
five reps in the tank or what you say is
through it max is really 50 pounds under
it
then you're absolutely not getting the
best results but on the other hand if
you're grinding all the way to failure
all the time
and trying your absolute hardest every
single time there's a time and place for
that
then you're probably not getting the
best results so how do we make sure that
we're giving it a really good run but
not too much we can use something like
the rpe scale the rating of perceived
exertion
rpe what does it say it's on a
one to ten scale but the real meat and
potatoes of the stimulative range of it
the stuff that actually makes you
stronger
is seven eight nine and ten an rpe of
seven
is like tough but you comfortably hit
the goal weight and the goal reps no
problem
an rpe f8 is very tough but no problem
you got it done which has pushed you
pretty far
an rp9 is super tough and a real
struggle and you have to be on your a
game
to hit all the weight in all the reps
that you wanted rpe
10 is like if someone put a pin onto
that squat rep number three
you wouldn't have come up you just
barely did it
so all those seem like pretty good
places to train
which one of those is the best well what
you can do
a decent approach and there are other
approaches that work really well i think
this one's probably one of the better
ones
is to start your best guess of what you
think an rp7 is
go in challenge yourself don't blow it
all out be like okay that was pretty
tough but easily got the
the load and got the reps write down
your weight that you did write down the
reps
next time you come in to do that same
session let's say a week later or
something like that
you want to add a little bit of weight
and match the reps that you got for
example week one you did 100 pounds
let's say in the bench press or
something
for three sets of five an average rpe of
seven the average set of five wasn't
that tough
next week you do 105 pounds and
maybe your rp stays seven which is
amazing you got stronger
or your rp bumps up to something like
eight it is more weight it is more
challenging and that's a good thing you
want to be egging in to pushing yourself
a little bit closer to your limits
week three 110 pounds more weight still
that's a five now it's an rp around nine
week four 115 pounds holy crap that's
way more than a hundred
fifteen percent increase if you're
counting at home by the way again three
sets of five
and this time it's rp10 you couldn't
have done any more now how do you know
you couldn't have done any more well
sooner or later you hit failure you
won't be able to match the repetitions
given that the load is escalating so
let's say week four you actually didn't
know
that it was rpe 10 like you felt like
you gave it all but you're like
maybe i could have done more you come in
especially as a beginner an intermediate
when you don't know your body well
enough you have to try it
week five you come in you put 120 pounds
on the bar
again five more pounds again that's the
core principle of strength training
progressive overload and you hit the
first set of five
got it tough second set of five got it
holy crap religious experience
third set supposed to get five but you
got four you literally couldn't come up
your training partner had to spot you
that's it you failed to make progress
all right so we know that that's rpe 10
you gave it everything you could you
still couldn't do it
that means your fatigue is super high
week six you would do easier training
something like a deload we'll talk about
later
you recover then you recycle the loads
maybe
next week after that you start at like
105 or 110 pounds right not 100 or 105.
and you start there at again rp7
and you slowly add load to the bar and
the rps slowly fall after some time
you hit all out rp 10 can't go any
further
relax and repeat and that's it
folks see you next time for the next
video
