bigger triceps with drop sets
fink and colleagues assigned 16 men
untrained at least in the last year into
either a drop set or normal set group
both groups train the triceps push down
twice per week for eight weeks
[Music]
the drop set group each session
performed repetitions to failure with a
12 rep max load and then subsequently
performed repetitions to failure with a
20 lighter load three consecutive times
in a row
the normal set group each session trains
the movement with 3 sets of repetitions
to failure with a 12 rep max load
using 90 seconds of rest between sets
increases in triceps cross-sectional
area favored the drop set group
for those interested we have a video on
the house of hypertrophy channel
detailing all the current research on
drop set training
