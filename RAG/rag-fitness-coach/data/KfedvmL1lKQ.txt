calves
profoundly easy to use a ton of weight
to impress
dot dot dot nobody nobody is a flying
fuck with you calf raise and the people
who know shit actively look at you and
disdain almost everyone that I've ever
seen do Cavs are shit little weight with
a small range of motion avoiding the
deep painful stretch has small calves
that never change so fuck that we're
gonna try to get growth and here's how
we're gonna try to do it Go a bit
lighter something you can handle to a
full range of motion for a set of like
20 reps or so you want to milk the
painful deep stretch and even pause at
the bottom so if you're doing calf
raises okay start here and you go down
and you go slow
pause ow up
down slow pause ow kill me up just like
that milk in that deep painful stretch
