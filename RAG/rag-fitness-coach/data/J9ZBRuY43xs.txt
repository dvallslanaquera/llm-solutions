the first person i got to train with
john meadows
if you don't know john he's a legend in
the bodybuilding
community i told him he did his first
show he was 13
and he's had a ton of success with
clients and also
himself on the pro circuit and she's
just got literally decades of experience
drive it up or down squeeze two more
come on one one more time
come on drive it down put it down
there we go so what is this contraption
we're gonna put it over our head we're
gonna do bro running
broad jump jump high jumps i wouldn't
rule it out
with you i really wouldn't a lot of
people
think that training with john is just
like a complete butt
bloodbath like it's just throwing
whatever at the wall
seeing what sticks it's actually not the
way it is having trained with him it's
actually much more
well thought through what we're going to
do is we're going to work our way up
slowly
so we'll have some volume but there's
only going to be one set that's really
really difficult
okay so we'll just work up to that so
you get a little bit more blood each a
little bit more blood nothing really to
failure but then once we get to that
weight where it's
we're going to be shooting for around
eight reps okay and then once we get up
to where it's a really tough eight
that's when we kick in that
really really hard set and that one set
is it's enough man all right
let's get it come on three more
two more come on go go go one more time
one more time
there we go okay stay in there stay in
there
okay eight more more here we go
one more okay now little partials little
partials right
one two three
four five six
seven okay now hold it now hold it ten
nine eight seven six
five four three
two and good job
good job that was that was fun man so
the main thing i learned from
mom is that it's actually really
important
to work hard to work hard in a
methodical way
so i would describe this as
appropriately applied effort
we know we need to apply effort maximize
progress but we need to do it at the
appropriate time
using the appropriate way my friends and
stuff ask me like how was the workout
like how
much did it hurt even though it was like
it was probably one of the more
challenging leg workouts i've ever done
but psychologically the reason you can
get through it
is because of the approach john takes
which is basically
all the sets leading up to that last one
are not
all-out sets so they're kind of like
preparing you for that one set
and then mentally you know all you've
got to do is give your all on that one
set so it's bearable
if you had to do that on say like five
straight sets for every exercise you
would just
burn out psychologically or i would
anyway so that was what made it actually
like enjoyable is because you're like
building up to this one final set and
then you just gotta go in that like
get it mentality and then um it's more
bearable that way right
why is screencard important i would say
work ethic really matters for support
success in general
obviously there are genetic differences
that determine how well people do in
different sports
but i would say with equal genetic
footing
what separates champions from say like
third place
probably work all right come on let me
work with you let me work with you
come on three more one two
three and hold it right there one right
there
ten nine eight seven hold it down hold
on hold down hold down four
three two and done
oh yeah
oh man that's the hardest that i've ever
done in my life
oh yeah baby i think there's an effort
threshold that you need to cross
in order to maximize growth i think this
is kind of just
common sense like you're not trying to
heart at all then you're not going to be
able to maximize growth
[Applause]
cool way of doing this i haven't really
seen it
much shared at all anywhere else at
least not in the way he does it
he has like this four phase sequence of
how he structures these exercises
during training he starts with an
activator exercise so the goal here
the main goal is injury prevention does
this kind of get blood flow into the
joint
get the muscles nice and loosened up
this is usually some kind of machine so
like a chest press
for example um i could actually do a
main compound movement so this is like
the main tension stuff so let's say a
incline fireball press
lower rep work here um also still
leaving a few reps in the tank
after that you'll do the pump base so
this is this is the real failure stuff
this is what
everybody kind of focuses on and this is
when he'll do
say drop sets accentuated negatives iso
holes
all the fun stuff you know in the videos
nice one
after that will be the stretch phase
this is what finishes with
i think this is also really smart so it
makes sense to put that at the end
also finishing with a stretch exercise
feels really good after a chest day
doing dumbbells with really strong
stretch at the bottom
or like an iso hold at the bottom i
think it's a really good way
to finish this off
oh man so first of all you're doing a
pretty damn good job man that's pretty
good there's a couple things though
i want you to stand right here i want
you to watch my shoulders
okay watch this now watch this
i am not watching this now watch this
oh yeah okay when you start coming down
here on your wrist
watch what's happening to my shoulders
what's going on with my shoulders coming
in it's coming forward closing you up so
if you want to look big and voluminous
get your hand here all the way in
against your loser side now lift your
chest drop it down a little bit
he's made yourself look a lot thicker
anyway you want to grab food or
yeah yeah no yeah man i've never turned
into a food yeah we've got to refuel
kiwi dog i like it that's the new
nickname you know what man
i used to always talk about kiwi like
several years ago we used to tell people
about the vitamin c
and how it's underrated really yeah
that's crazy
did we just become best friends yeah
crazy well i like to think of myself
