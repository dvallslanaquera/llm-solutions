hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
don't
reduce your soreness if you're sore and
want to grow
weekly tip number 30. here we go let's
keep it short let's keep it sweet i can
promise it'll be sweet i don't know
about short
hopefully i tend to ramble here we go
let's say your last session for quads or
hamstrings or chest or something like
that made you really really sore in
those muscles
and
you know that when you heal again
and your muscles are healed you can
train again and provide more hypertrophy
so you're probably thinking quite
rationally of course
that hey like i want to heal as fast as
possible very good
but how you attempt to reduce the
soreness
is a really really big question
and you might not even be sore yet but
you trained your quads your hams your
chest or whatever and you know that this
kind of workout that you can tell by the
way how weak your muscles are how
weirdly they're contracting and
everything that you're going to get
ultrasource you're going to think
maybe i can make it so that the soreness
doesn't last as long and do some things
now to keep the soreness from really
hitting me
maybe you have an idea to do some of the
following quite popular things to reduce
how high the soreness gets or if the
soreness is high to reduce how much
you're feeling it and be ready to train
again faster you may be
into some of the following things the
cryo chamber cold exposure a contrast
bath which is fucking terrible a
contrast shower hot cold hot cold hot
cold it's awful it's a form of torture
ibuprofen et cetera et cetera et cetera
you can even ice the region that
sometimes works
will these things reduce the peak
soreness yes
will they sometimes bring down the
soreness after it's already at peak or
on its way yes
however
all of these interfere with growth
generally speaking
when you've been exposed to an exercise
stimulus you get some combination of
recovery and adaptation in response to
it however these types of modalities
heat
extreme cold a combination
or anti-inflammatories all of these work
to reduce inflammation by the way like
ibuprofen
what they do is they speed up recovery
but at the expense of adaptation so you
heal faster
but healing in this case doesn't mean as
much growth
because like there's tons of instances
where you heal but you don't grow if you
get into a car accident hopefully you
heal up from that but your doctor
doesn't come into your hospital bed
three months later like oh my god your
fucking leg is jacked i'm sure glad that
truck ran over it it just healed it
didn't grow
so
if we are going to use these modalities
we want to use them almost exclusively
in the context in which you need to
recover really fast and you don't care
about adaptation and hold on a sec what
when do we not care about adaptation
well in some specific sports
circumstances for example let's say
you're in a
soccer tournament and it's every other
day you play a game so long as you win
the game you go you know
standing quarter final semi-finals final
something like that
in between the days
each game is going to make you pretty
fucking sore has the potential to
if you use ibuprofen or you use contrast
or you use cryochamber after the games
to become less sore what you can do is
recover faster and then each successive
game that you qualify for by winning the
earlier ones you're not as sore going
into the game which means your
performance is higher now somebody can
say hold on a second that means your
legs aren't adapting to the soccer
training as much but hold on it's not
training yeah you get less quad growth
but who gives a shit you don't you have
the same size quads fine but those are
the same size quads that got you to
winning all the qualifying games they
got you into the finals you're not going
to add so much quad muscle size or
cellular capacity between three games
over a week that you're going to like
win the championship versus not the
recovery is 50 trillion times more
important than the adaptation so we
intentionally do these anti-inflammatory
measures ice or contrast or heat or
anti-inflammatory drugs
what that does is it allows us to
recover really fast
at the expense of adaptation but it gets
us performing when we need to
however if you're just training in the
gym regularly
and you are trying to get jacked or
strong you do not want to use these
then what do you do in order to heal
soreness faster because all ibuprofen
heat cold stuff off the table as a
matter of fact a bad thing so then hold
on we're just supposed to fucking live
with the soreness to an extent yes but
there are a few things you can do to
reduce
at least how long the soreness lasts in
a way that doesn't interfere with
adaptation here they are i'm going to
tell you then you like
this shit again
[Music]
hey do you want to like go on a date
with me
okay
hey
we're going on a date cool
yeah
[Music]
eat well and a lot healthy food lots of
protein lots of calories
sleep well and a lot you already know
the drill and yes before you ask special
sports supplements aka anabolic steroids
and related derivatives um they do
reduce soreness in the good way
time to peak soreness can be shorter
peak soreness can be higher or lower but
the total duration of soreness the time
to heal is faster with anabolics for
sure right just because i know you some
of you are interested in that sort of
thing but basically for the rest of us
it's eat well and sleep well that's what
recovers source when you say oh man my
biceps are really sore what do i do
do you want to grow biceps well yeah
eat and sleep and i wish i had some
other shit to tell you about like well
if you contrast bath and then go in the
cryo chamber and fucking freeze the
thing of ice on the bicep and then break
it off you're gonna heal and it's gonna
be great but that will cause you gains
it's not a really good thing
so
again there is another thing you can do
a really really trippy idea
to reduce soreness and that is never
allow
as much of the immune system-mediated
inflammatory cascade even gets started
essentially not allow your body to gear
up to make those adaptations how does it
do that well it allows the immune system
to infiltrate the muscle cells and just
the muscle area in general that inflames
it and that's what causes that secondary
damage you know right after workout
you're not very sore you're sworn in
delayed onset you're sore 12 hours later
24 hours later even more sore that's
when all that immune system stuff and
all the recovery and adaptive machinery
arrives essentially starts kind of
peeling your muscles open and fixing
them and making them bigger you can
prevent that from happening to a large
extent how well you can do the ice heat
cold anti-inflammatory stuff which you
can also do is train very hard
and then over the rest of the day eat
very little
very little protein very little food in
general you can do psychedelic drugs or
something like that
stay up all night and don't sleep
because if you have a good night of
sleep especially if you've eaten plenty
of that day lots of protein before you
go to bed you guys have had this
experience you wake up source fuck the
next morning you're like shit the sleep
didn't work it made me worse it didn't
make you worse it allowed that soreness
to occur because that soreness is part
of the adaptive process if you skip that
night of sleep and then get very little
the next day as well
you would probably not get nearly as
sore at all in that muscle group as you
would from that same exact workout if
you had eaten plenty and slept plenty
and not been stressed out
so we think okay how do i reduce
soreness someone's like fucking easy
brooch don't fucking eat a lot don't
sleep that next night you're like
beautiful i'll really get jacked then no
you won't and you of course you knew
that that's crazy
so when we change we think of ourselves
as trying to avoid soreness or reduce it
we have to be very careful not to kill
the golden goose that lays the golden
eggs i guess it's just the regular goose
that lays the golden eggs
in any case this is not by accident
getting sore isn't necessarily a good
thing but in the context of hypertrophy
in a timeline in which you can recover
on time getting soreness is or sorry
getting sore is a good thing
and healing from the soreness via two
things food and rest is exactly the plan
never letting your soreness peak or
healing it artificially quickly
by using ice or heat or meds or
post-workout cardio is another one if
you get uh right off of the squat rack
and your legs are super pumped if you do
like 30 minutes of incline walking it
actually flushes a lot of the
metabolites out it prevents a lot
of that hypertrophy signaling getting
into motion and then you actually won't
get a sore you'd be like oh my god i
found this ultimate hack i do a crazy
hard leg workout get the gains and then
i do hard cardio right after for 30
minutes and i'm not sore i can train you
know uh three days earlier than i would
before yeah it's nice except you
canceled out all the gains that you're
doing it's a bad idea
it'll lead to poor growth so what you
really want to do is this train hard
get whatever soreness comes with
training hard it's just something you
gotta just take and you have to
understand that in many contexts that's
actually a good thing
and then when the question is well how
do i reduce the soreness you really just
have two options one eat plenty to sleep
plenty
train hard get sore eat a ton sleep a
ton recover repeat that's the growth
formula see you next time
