hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
prioritization rp plus rpu
hypertrophy concepts and tools lecture
number
10 the multiple types of
fatigue so
here we go what is on the menu for today
first thing we're going to talk about is
why uh fatigue is relevant and really
what it is we're going to talk about the
multiple sources and list them of where
fatigue comes from
we're going to talk about all these
sources separately local fatigue axial
fatigue and systemic fatigue
we're going to talk about how fatigue is
detected in a later lecture in lecture
12 we'll actually talk
exactly what to do about fatigue but
here generally we're going to talk about
how to interpret it
and what implications there are for both
training and for direct
programming so let's get into it
multiple sources of fatigue there are
three sources of fatigue
that are relevant to training really
there are
four i'll explain that in just a second
three main sources
are number one local fatigue which is
the peripheral nervous system that is
the nerve that communicates to the
muscle and the one that communicates
back or ones that communicate back
and the muscle itself right uh sorry the
pns peripheral nervous system just those
nerves right that communicate to the
muscle from the spinal cord to the
muscle and back
and then the muscle cell itself which
actually does uh the force generation
and the connective tissue around the
muscle cell so basically the muscle and
the nerve that talks to it and gets
feedback back is
local and if that stuff gets tired at a
mechanistic level we can call that local
fatigue
axial fatigue we'll get to defining in
just a bit but
it's essentially fatigue of compression
of the spinal cord or taxation of the
back muscles
really really interesting topic and then
the last kind of fatigue or second to
last
is systemic fatigue and that's fatigue
that affects your entire body and it's
composed
of central nervous system fatigue which
is brain and spinal cord of two
different types and we'll get to those
later
physiological and psychological which is
actually different kind of fatigue all
together
and then there's some stuff that happens
with the secretion of various
chemicals generally called cytokines
when you train really hard they affect
the rest of the system
and of course other organ systems
specifically the cardiovascular system
are affected pretty predictably by
training so if you just train your legs
something called systemic spillover
fatigue that affects all the other
systems
and other muscles so very different type
of fatigue than just local
it's going to need a different treatment
it's going to need a different diagnosis
so on and so forth
lastly and this is kind of a little
point at the end of the slide here
when you're talking about fatigue and
managing it and reducing it in the
context of training
we have to realize that not all fatigue
comes from training
so there is all kinds of other
training stressors and non-training
stressors that you do walking around a
lot
running to catch the bus having a really
stressful day at work moving around to
tons physical stuff
you can do another sport tons of
physical fatigue which is not
covered by these training induced
fatigue hypertrophy training induced
fatigue sources in addition to that the
psychological fatigue
that is also has nothing to do with
training if you spend
you know a ton of time uh fighting with
an ex-girlfriend on the phone
that is a ton of psychological fatigue
that actually affects your systemic
fatigue
and thus your ability to train super
hard so yes these are the three sources
of training-induced fatigue
but we have to not forget that all the
other fatigue that comes from training
has to be dealt with somehow we'll talk
about later exactly how to deal
let's get into the details local fatigue
has three separate components first
component is the pns the peripheral
nervous system
essentially the main focus of this kind
of fatigue is
the nerve that communicates from your
spinal cord
to the actual muscle itself that says
fire fire fire
because there's another nerve that goes
through your spinal cord tells that
nerve
to talk to your actual muscle especially
close to the muscle itself that nerve
essentially comes up and there's a
junction between the nerve and the
muscle
called the neuromuscular junction here's
the muscle here's the nerve and the
nerve communicates through various
neurotransmitters by secreting
essentially very uh
various chemicals into this junction and
those chemicals hit right on the muscle
surface
and there's further communication to
tell the muscle to contract and so on
and so forth
right but just that nervous system part
especially this last part
super close to the end of the nerve it
gets tired in a variety of ways
for example you can uh you know in order
for this nerve to keep firing firing
firing if you say contract and track
contract
every time you fire a nerve you
essentially
have some chemicals flow into the nerve
and flow out of the nerve and that's
what causes
the cascade of electrical activity that
actually is the information of the
mirror
the inflow and outflow once the
chemicals that go in
go in they have to be pumped out really
quickly so they can come back in
and the ones that are pumped out have to
go back in and have to be pumped out
again
so there has to be a resetting every
single time because you get essentially
chemical inflow and then chemical
outflow
but the outflow is different chemicals
and that happens at the same time sodium
potassium
go one way and the other way they have
to re-establish the gradients which
means basically
as nerves fire you have for example
sodium goes into the nerve like crazy
and then for it to fire again all that
sodium has to be pushed back out
the processes that re-pump and reset a
nerve to be able to fire again
work incredibly efficiently but not
perfectly so after an intense bout of
firing
the efficiency of reflow is not 100 and
some of the messages from the spinal
cord for example
could not get through because the nerve
isn't actually reset when it's supposed
to be
in addition to that there are
neurotransmitters that are essentially
chemicals that communicate from this
part of the nerve
secreted into the neuromuscular junction
between the muscle and nerve
and then they go touch the muscle and
makes it do you know essentially makes
the muscle contract
right but there are only so many
neurotransmitters stored in little
vesicles and little containers
inside this distal area of the nerve if
you use a whole lot of them
rapidly intensely tons of nervous
communication fire fire fire fire fire
you can actually run low on
neurotransmitters specifically in the
muscle to the nerve it's acetylcholine
and potentially run low on some of the
resupplies
that make those neurotransmitters
potentially run low on transport
proteins so on and so forth
and what ends up happening is the nerve
firing from here from the spinal cord
all the way down
to the neuromuscular junction could be
a-okay but there could be a
neurotransmitter
problem and not all of the signal gets
through you get signal degradation
there's almost never a time when the
nerve just doesn't do anything but like
you're trying to say go 100 and it might
only communicate 90
this is a problem because it means the
muscle is listening to the nerve and
says oh ninety percent sweet got it it
just only goes ninety percent
well that's fatigue and at some point
you know the muscle goes 99 you can
still perform at a high level it goes to
90
you have a detriment it goes to 85 60 or
whatever percent and all of a sudden you
might not even contracting half the
muscle that you're supposed to be
thus the hypertrophic stimulus is
severely severely degraded
right not just the nerve that re that
gets into these problems when the muscle
cell and we get into this in just a
second
generates a ton of metabolites lactic
acid for example
the metabolites can actually flow into
this neuromuscular junction
and they radically change the acidity
and thus the behavior of chemicals in
that neuromuscular junction
and can lead to what's called excitation
contraction decoupling
excitation is when the nerve says hey
muscle contract
and contraction is the one the muscle
contracts usually that's coupled
essentially one to one the nerve says go
the muscle doesn't
but if you have a bunch of gunk for lack
of a better term a bunch of metabolites
and acids and all this other stuff
in the neuromuscular junction and
actually some of it flows into the nerve
itself and there's tons of it in the
muscle
and all of these points you can
essentially get
an interference effect which again not
all the signals get through
is there so much acid sometimes it's
like oh fire okay great but sometimes
it's like fire
i don't know what's going on the muscle
never really senses anything and then
the firing doesn't happen
so that excitation contraction
uncoupling it's actually something you
can
feel if you train to failure or beyond
failure every now and again
especially with a relatively high reps
when you have a lot of acid if you ever
felt a huge burn in the muscles
doing high rep lunges you
psychologically still feels very strong
your nervous system still feels strong
you feel like you can push
you contract your quad and you literally
feel like an emptiness like nothing's
happening
like you're trying to make it go and
it's just going it's just not doing much
that is actually excitation contraption
uncoupling in part
right so all of these things are to say
that when the muscle
isn't cooperating we can't just say it's
the muscle for sure
it's actual nerve it's motor nerve that
makes it contract may be a part of that
uh lack of cooperation so that's the
peripheral nervous system side of local
fatigue because it's local it's to that
muscle itself it's the nerve
right there at the quad that's giving us
trouble
second is the muscle cell this is the
most obvious source of fatigue
and kind of where most of the fatigue
really is centered and sort of where it
starts it's like the focal point
the muscle cell itself fatigues for a
variety of reasons one easy one is fuel
depletion
you have this much glycogen starting out
after a bunch of contractions you have
this
much glycogen left and you need a lot of
it to fuel really powerful contraction
and when you
run low then contraction is no longer
very powerful and you have fatigue
as observed in decreases in performance
and perceptive
decreases out like i feel really really
weak right
so fuel depletion super easy some fuels
replete really quickly so uh creatine
uh phosphate the phosphagens atp
creatine phosphate et cetera
they take seconds or a minute and a half
or something to replete
other sources like uh glycogen for
example
they take hours of eating to replete and
perhaps even longer so it depends on the
substrate
but you know this lecture is not
designed to determine
uh acute fatigue and cumulative fatigue
it's you know acute fatigue causes
cumulative fatigue by just summing up so
that's actually the super simple
explanation there um but this is so an
acute and cumulative
this stuff happens and how long the
fatigue takes to dissipate is something
we'll chat about later altogether
another source of fatigue in the cell
itself is metabolic presence that needs
clearance
so a cell can a muscle cell can contract
and track contract and it produces a lot
of lactic acid
and some of that lactic acid can't be
used anywhere and it piles up in the
cell
cool thing is that probably contributes
to muscle growth that literally a lot of
that lactic acid
tells the muscle like hey time to grow
but
if you have a ton of it in there it
literally interferes with every part of
excitation contraction and the actual
muscle contraction
so there's a certain level of acidity in
which the contractile proteins
themselves that make the muscle cells
contract can no longer work
they just don't nothing happens right
and if you lactic acid is that high
first of all you feel a really nasty
burn
because the nerves around the area pick
it up but second of all your ability to
contract unless your fatigue is going to
be or contraction
ability decreases fatigue concomitantly
is very high
lastly damage right you absolutely
damage the cell in a real physical sense
with high power contractions
parts of molecules crack off and fly off
you have rips and other molecules like
the connective molecules that actually
make sure to hold everything in place
and that kind of damage
absolutely sums up especially over
multiple reps in multiple sets
right so like within one set metabolites
are real nasty but between sets they
usually come down to reasonable levels
usually
damage is something that is set after
set after set you experience more and
more damage
and your ability to do any of these
things well starts to really go out the
window
right so damage in the in the sense of
literally like you know
how fatigued is your car well how beat
up is your car same idea and if parts of
it are missing
if the steering wheel doesn't turn one
way it's not going to be able to work
optimally
so if someone could test your car for
fatigue and say well how fast can you
racing around the track if you can't
turn your steering wheel properly you're
gonna have a slower time around the
track same exact idea parts of your cell
are literally broken and that's
absolutely a thing
lastly and this one's kind of super
obvious is local connective tissue
fatigue
so your muscle cell can be super good to
go and produce a ton of force
but the connective tissue sheath around
the muscle
is starting to have micro tears in it
and that's called the fascia the
aponeurosis can have tears in it micro
tears
which is essentially like a tenderness
like connection to another muscle
or to a bone or something like that from
the muscle itself
tendons of course ligaments and various
parts of joints
can accumulate literal damage as you
train
usually they don't accumulate a whole
lot of damage in any one session
but they certainly do but over multiple
sessions multiple sessions
multiple sessions join multiple sessions
multiple sessions
can actually start to come up until it's
relevant and sometimes the way it's
relevant is increases injury risk
and that's why volumes and loads have to
be managed you can't train super hard
forever
right that's all local which is to say
if you train the living crap out of your
biceps
your quads are going to have no more
tendon damage they're not going to have
any more muscle cell damage
or peripheral nervous system fatigue
than they did if you didn't train them
at all
right and if you train the biceps at all
or not no no relation
whatsoever right next so that's local
fatigue
before we get to systemic we have to
talk about a special case
of sort of local fatigue this is why we
put axial fatigue
in between systemic and local because
it's kind of between the two so axial
fatigue
really does deserve in the context of
hypertrophy training its own mention
it's nothing that we would mention
if we were doing a fatigue chapter on
soccer players or something a fatigue
discussion on soccer players
we might mention local fatigue and
systemic fatigue we might not mention
axial fatigue
axial fatigue we're not exactly sure why
it results
it's probably due to vertical loading of
the spine and the
specific detectors of that and or the
muscles of the spine
having to be uh highly highly active and
the fatigue of those muscles the damage
of those muscles
it's very likely based neurologically
because the way it seems to operate
is very neurologically what that means
is
even if your back muscles are tired why
would that make your leg muscles weaker
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense at
the local level
like if your back muscles are really
tired and you were squatting you would
start to round over
and then you could still do the same
with your legs but your back position
would suck
axial fatigue is when you have enough
spinal loading
your brain your central nervous system
seems to communicate to all of your
other limbs
hey ease up because we're beat up and
transitioning force
transmitting force through the axis of
the body
might not be a real good idea so then if
you're really actually fatigued
from lots of loading of the spine what
might end up happening
is if you load a spine during the
movement
your legs become weaker during that
movement you used to be able to squat
when you literally feel like your legs
can't lift as much okay
really really trippy effect and we'll
talk about how to test for that later
it usually occurs i mean it's cumulative
like all other sources of fatigue and it
usually
the biggest contributors are movements
that heavily load the spine and the
these their spinal erection musculature
erection i hope you guys caught that
so deadlifts huge huge axial fatigue
squats especially the heavier the more
fatiguing rose
and to some extent leg presses right but
much less of an extent the squats and
that's something we're going to talk
about in a little bit
the heaviest spinal loads those are the
ones
that cause axial fatigue the most no
surprise right
so if you're doing curls holding 90
pounds
90 pounds of tension passing through
your spine you'd have to do a lot of
curls to get a lot of axial fatigue
if you're doing standing barbell
shoulder presses
that's more weight now and a lot of
contraction of the spinal musculature to
keep you in the right position
more axial fatigue especially you have
to generate really high forces to stay
stable at the top
squatting tons of axial fatigue
squatting
low bar even more axial fatigue because
the weights are heavier and there's more
back involvement
so think of it like that and
the reason we're mentioning axial
fatigue is this
you may not be systemically fatigued
like the rest of your body is generally
fine
but pushing your training might get your
axial fatigue up to a limiting
amount before systemic fatigue gets to
that amount
so systemically might still be fine but
after a few weeks of training a lot of
squats and deadlifts for example
your leg training might suffer
significantly
because your axial fatigue is so high so
it pays to look at it as a separate
source of fatigue so that we can address
it as a separate source of
d and we'll talk about in just a little
bit how we can potentially address it
what exactly we can do about it to make
sure it doesn't get out of hand
in such a way that interferes with our
training too soon in the training
process of course it's eventually going
to get out of hand
you know six weeks after we started an
accumulation message cycle then we need
to deload duh
but it would really suck if you have
nice six week accumulation measure
planned
and you knew damn well systemic fatigue
wasn't going to hit you or local wasn't
going to hit you until the six week mark
and at the three week mark your axial
fatigue is too high right so it's
definitely something that requires its
own mention
lastly for this section systemic fatigue
tons of contributors first
physiological central nervous system
fatigue
right when your brain and spinal cord
are deciding to contract muscles or
messaging to contract muscles
this particular neurons right that are
part of the nervous structures that tell
whatever muscle to contract
are the ones that are very very active
they run into the identical problems
that the peripheral nerve runs into when
it has
pns fatigue at the local level failure
to re-establish gradients
reductions in neurotransmitter load and
thus again
failure to have a total signal
transduction right
so for example the primary motor cortex
which is the part of the brain that
essentially tells you sort of how to do
a squat how to execute that movement
if you're doing squats you do tons and
tons and tons of squats the specific
nerves involved in those communications
can become to some extent
tired right and fatigued and need maybe
a few hours maybe longer maybe some
minutes
um to re-establish their ability to fire
at 100 efficiency
so it's absolutely possible that central
nervous system fatigue
in these ways even if the local muscle
is totally good to go and totally fine
even if the local nerve is totally good
to go and totally fine the central
nervous system can be fatigued
and then you don't exactly get what you
want you can't
train in such a way that pushes the
local muscle to within
its limits which newsflash as you've
heard from other lectures
is the way hypertrophy happens so that's
one of the reasons why systemic fatigue
specifically central nervous system
fatigue
is so nasty because it
feels like you're training hard your
performance is down of course
but because it feels like you're
training hard you could say you know
while i'm training hard
mission accomplished but the problem is
it's only hard for your nervous system
it's not hard for your local muscles and
your nervous system
having a hard time at something makes
your nervous system better which is nice
makes you better at squatting when
you're tired
but it it's such a easy challenge for
the local system
because it's barely being called on to
do anything that
nothing sort of challenges it and
doesn't get better for example
if you wanted to improve the efficiency
of a local fast food joint you want the
employees to get a challenge
lots of volume of work tons of angry
customers
and so they can really improve they
watch them how they respond and you have
someone there
who coaches fast food restaurant workers
to become more efficient in their
movements you have someone there like
when they have the challenge
he's like okay here's what we learned
here's how you change yourself and then
they become slowly better over time
because they're really really good at
responding to super high volume high
demand times
if the workers are pushed to their
limits locally at that store they learn
they grow they get better just like
muscles
but if you try to do this and
the branch office uh basically
doesn't uh send you you know it stops
advertising for your for your local
store
and you have way fewer employ people
coming to buy your stuff
and buy your food then yeah it maybe is
very hard for the branch office
right it's tired let's say it's tired it
was too lazy to tell people to advertise
your your mcdonald's
but then the employees your mcdonald's
are like seems like a pretty easy day
and are they getting better at their
jobs no because they're not being pushed
to the limit
same idea with muscles it's not the
pushing the whole system to the limit
that gets you better at hypertrophy it's
the pushing the local muscle to the
limit
the only way you can do that is to make
sure the central nervous system and
other systemic factors
are not the limiting factor it has to be
the local place
itself the local muscle itself that's
limiting factor that way it gets pushed
challenged appropriately and gets better
right now
it's not all physiology here's the real
interesting part part b
of systemic fatigue the second part is
cns fatigue
psychological fatigue okay what does
that mean
here's the thing trying really hard in
training
is psychologically fatiguing it beats
you up at an almost emotional level and
all of you have felt this before you're
trying you're trying
how many sets to failure does it take
and how many weeks have sets to failure
until you're like
i don't want to train anymore it's tough
to try
really hard and it gets tougher as
fatigue accumulates so in week one you
can come in and smash shit
week two you're golden week three you
know it's tough
week four five six you might just
lose touch entirely with why the hell
you're training at all your ability to
try hard goes down the drain
over time very very very pertinent and
we have ways
to make sure that this doesn't stop us
in training because remember if you're
psychologically not
willing or interested in pushing the
biceps as hard as they can be pushed
then you're capping the psychology and
maybe that psychological challenge makes
you mentally stronger
but you know worse is a hypertrophy
lecture
we're trying to get jacked mental
strength sweet we'll do some meditation
or something
you got to make sure that your
psychology is not limiting i'm going to
have ways to make sure to do that
point number c point number three here
is cytokines so cytokines are
essentially a variety of different kinds
of molecules
that get released from a cell when it
has expended a high level of effort
and or when it's been damaged and the
cytokines are really
a lot of them are pro-inflammatory so
what they do is they essentially
communicate to various parts of the
immune system
and they say hey we're messed up over
here come help us
so the immune system infiltrates those
areas and starts the repair process so
on and so forth
but the immune system has a way of
degrading performance even further
it's kind of like you know if a building
and i've used this analogy before
plus if a building gets damaged by a
pretty gnarly storm you can still get
work done in the building
until the repair workers come in and
start fixing stuff then they take up all
the space they take all the lights
they're in the way
you can't really get a ton of work done
or as much work done so
you know if you have a huge holiday rush
and there's a storm that breaks a couple
windows
you might just patch those windows up
and just finish doing your work so you
can go on your holiday vacation after
all the business is done
but you know why would you do that why
don't you just invite the workers in
well you know the workers tend to gunk
up the works
until they're done finishing everything
and then productivity goes back up
so cytokines what they end up doing is
they essentially
in in some sense attract immune system
elements
to come in and fix stuff that depresses
local ability but here's the thing
when cytokines are secreted from a small
muscle
you know they go to other places but
they're just not that much of them not
that many of them
or a muscle that hasn't been damaged
excessively or small fraction of a total
muscle no big deal
if you're training your whole body hard
all the time which is a big part of
training in the last several weeks of
accumulation
all of your muscles are secreting
cytokines to some extent or leaking them
for
lack of a better term that creates a
systemic
pseudo-inflammatory not really pseudo a
systemic inflammatory response
in a systemic immune response your whole
system is basically like shit
stuff is wrong everywhere right it's
almost like
water leaks into a submarine in one
little compartment no big deal you shut
it off whatever we'll deal with it when
we get to shore
water starts leaking from five and six
different compartments it's gonna get
into a lot of places and especially
essentially everywhere so the cytokines
when they leak out of some muscles you
know
you can train the crap out of your
biceps and you know yeah you get some
cytokines everywhere in your body so
after a hard bicep workout
if you're gonna get sick anyway if
there's a big viral load or something
that might push you over the edge immune
or response super compensation
not likely however and you may have
noticed this before
if you have a hard leg workout or a
super hard full body workout the amount
of cytokine release is
huge and then if you were gonna get sick
that's when you get sick
right how many of you have gotten sick
right after a huge leg workout like
great leg workout you go in there maybe
like you felt sort of like you were
maybe getting sick before
you go in there and you fucking smash it
you come home
you know you feel a little more tired
than usual you have a meal you feel
great
and then one two or three hours later
you start to like be like oh nope yep
i'm
sick runny nose fever that whole thing
that's why that happens in large part is
because so much of your system has been
damaged the immune system's like oh
something's going on we got to respond
to this right remember most of the
symptoms of being sick
especially caused by your immune
system's reaction right
so that's the deal with cytokines and
they're proportional to how hard you're
training
how much volume you're training and the
total volume of muscularity
which is to say if you train more of
your body in the larger muscle groups
there's more of a systemic response
more systemic fatigue to everything else
and the bigger you are
the more the response is you can take a
person who weighs
110 pounds put them through a gnarly leg
workout and they walk out and they're
like
you know tired right you can put a
person
who weighs 250 pounds through a gnarly
leg workout and if they have huge quads
that's going to be life and death for
them right and not literal sense
hopefully
but if they were about to get sick a
huge quad workout could push you over
the edge and get you sick as hell
if your quads are so big relative to the
rest of your body that
they secrete that many cytokines that
your body's like every time your quad
secrete cytokines are like bodies like
we're dying
we're dying alert something's really
wrong our cytokine levels is not
supposed to be inside
right really really really uh pertinent
stuff
lastly and this isn't just honorable
mention this is very important
as the cardiovascular system fatigue and
other organ system fatigue you can push
your physiology so hard
it takes the rest of your body to
support hard training and
especially in a cumulative sense over
weeks and weeks and months and months
the rest of your body can become
fatigued but this also occurs in an
acute sensor for example
lactic acid is produced at the local
muscular level and usually blood carries
it out
and parts of blood very cells and
various chemical elements
uh help or various molecules help to
buffer the lactic acid essentially make
it not an acid anymore no big deal
but if you push training hard enough
with enough muscles of your body
the lactic acid load can be so great
that the rest of your body is not so
good at dealing with it anymore and
total body acidity can start to climb up
that makes you crazy crazy fatigued and
can just put you
on your ass um that some
uh some of that can be seen in uh
something related hypertrophy training
uh
you can actually do this when i perjury
training um
400 meter runners talk about hitting the
wall it's relatively rare
but hitting the wall is when you outpace
yourself and
your lactic acid levels get so high that
your entire body essentially freezes up
and you fall
people literally run and then just
bought like that and they fall over
then they can't get up usually it's not
a matter of get up and finish the race
they try to get up and they're like oh
my god
right in a couple you know 10 15 seconds
later they can still start moving again
but there's no returning back to normal
pace it just
doesn't happen you can do this through
leg workouts if you're
if you're so inclined where the total
body acidity is so high you throw up
and so on and so forth and that's really
like the cardiovascular system
just isn't powerful enough to deal with
that much fatigue and spillover at the
same time
so definitely definitely pertinent and
of course the easiest form of
cardiovascular fatigue to detect is
after a set of bench or squat or pull
downs you breathe heavy for some time
and then you breathe less heavy that's
cardiovascular fatigue expressing itself
that's you actually breathing out the
buffering byproducts of lactic acid to
some extent
pumping oxygen through taking away waste
on and so forth you can push that
process so hard that you end up
breathing much heavily for much longer
and then your performance isn't as good
especially if you're on a fixed
rest interval schedule so if you rest
for three minutes between sets but you
really push to set super crazy hard with
a big part of your body
three minutes later you could still be
like and people are like you're ready to
go you're like no i'm not ready to go
i'm going to be limited by my
cardiovascular
system right all right
that's fatigue and it's multiple causes
how do we detect them because some of
these things are pretty mysterious you
know we're not going to be measuring
excitation contraction coupling directly
so how do we know how many cytokines are
in our blood who the hell knows
we do have some clues though as to how
to measure local fatigue actual fatigue
and systemic fatigue to know when
they're there
and how big they are first up local
fatigue
fundamentally you measure local fatigue
by local muscle performance
the big thing here
is compared to what and so this third
point here
is but the rest of you feels fine
because
if your local muscles are not performing
at a high level it could be because
you're systemically fatigued and of
course your local muscles are part of
that system so they're also fatigued
what you have to show is that your local
muscle is fatigued but everything else
is just hunky-dory and golden
part of it is how you feel everywhere
else right you
for example could curl 30 pounds for 10
top set
but a minute later because you didn't
rest long enough you might only be able
to do six
is there a systemic fatigue at work sure
but a minute later
you might not even be breathing heavy
neurologically psychologically you might
feel 100 totally golden
and if you did an exercise that you
didn't just fatigue the muscle you might
be able to hit an all-time pr
but your biceps and or the nerve that
innervates them
might still be fatigued and thus even
though you feel great
stops at six instead of ten and you go
huh holy crap i lost four reps
well that's local fatigue so if the rest
of you feels good but a certain muscle
group and this can even be over time
right so if it two minutes later a
minute later you can only do six
two days later you can only do nine
that's cumulative fatigue
right so it's possible to take a muscle
depleted substrate damage it
do all this other stuff to it fatigue
the crap out of it and then it takes a
few days
to heal that fatigue and recover to
where it's back to relatively normal
if you train before then you will
experience a loss of fatigue but it gets
worse
it usually takes a few days but if you
fatigue it over and over and over and
over fatigue accumulates to where now it
takes five or six days for that total
fatigue to clear
so when you train biceps twice a week
after several weeks of doing that
monday's fatigue still hangs in a lot
and past thursdays and past mondays into
this thursday
so this thursday you try to do the 30s
for 10 you get them for eight
and that is as we'll see in another
lecture exceeding your mrv
because the cumulative fatigue of all
the volume you've been summing
is now so high that you can't recover
session a session
and then that's definitely not a
sustainable thing right
very very uh simple local fatigue and
this is super easy to detect
is joint and connective tissue
discomfort or soreness right so if
you're training your bicep so much that
your elbows hurt now
very very specific very local fatigue to
those connective tissues
that are part of the joint structures of
training your biceps super super
straightforward
axial fatigue the easiest way or the
most straightforward way to detect axial
fatigue
is difference in performance between
more and less axially loaded moves
for the same muscle group easiest
example here
is squat versus leg press if your squat
is starting to tank
or you're still hitting your reps but
the reps are way harder
but your leg press is golden as day
totally you're just grooving
kitten pr's left and right it's not your
legs that are tired well what the hell's
between your legs
and the bar in the squat ta-da it's your
core it's your axis
it's your spinal cord right makes
perfect sense
bent over row versus a machine row event
overall you have to support your own
body and their spinal throughput
on a machine chest supported row it's
really just your rolling muscles lats
and rhomboids and stuff and your spine
doesn't have to do a whole lot of
anything
so if your machine row has fallen and
your bent row has fallen in performance
clearly it's either local or systemic
it's not axial
because whatever is affecting that is
the muscle or the whole rest of the body
too
but if your bent row is starting to
suffer but you're hitting pr's on
machine rows or on pull downs and all
those other
muscle exercises that use the same
muscle clearly it's not systemic
because you're still performing really
well in those local muscles and clearly
it's not the local muscles themselves
because the local muscles seem to be
just fine if you isolate them but if you
put
the erection part in the equation again
erection part
right you have to stay upright on a bent
row loads the spine
uses the spinal rectors that's where the
fatigue is coming from
another easy one just here for example
for your own sort of modification stiff
legged deadlift versus leg chrome it's a
little bit different of a movement
different muscles are involved
but you can definitely rule out
hamstring fatigue maybe it's glute
fatigue right maybe it's technical
something or other but
you know the axial loading of a stiff
leg a deadlift is really really intense
with a leg curl there is no actual
loading
right actually loading right and i my my
stuff like deadlifts didn't go super
well today i think my hamstrings are
fatigued the way you find out if that's
true
is what are your electron numbers like
so let's say two three days later you
hit the leg curl you hit all-time pr's
your hamstrings feel great
what's the conclusion your hamstrings
are fine it's probably the actual
fatigue between that's doing that
right a really interesting further way
to confirm that it's axial fatigue
is that actual fatigue because it's
specific to the spine and the muscles
that keep your spine upright i was going
to say wrecked again but it didn't oh
there you go i said it
because we're looking at
our hypothesis that it's really the
spine that's fatigued or the spine it's
addendum structures we have to have a
confirmation that everywhere that the
spine is involved
is feeling the burden so for example
if your seated shoulder press um
or g you know your front raise
and your tricep extension are totally
fine the performance is great
but your standing barbell press
performance is tanked we suspect axial
fatigue because that's the different
limiting factor
there um but
and this is a really big butt if your
low bar squats are still really awesome
if your deadlifts are still very awesome
and if your bent rows are unaffected
gee you know it's a real interesting
hypothesis to say the spine and its
ability to stay upright or tired
but it's not evident in anything except
for one exercise
so if it's just one exercise that's
actually loading versus not that's a
difference in performance
yeah man that's not enough to conclude
that what you really
want to look at is okay suspect that
you're actually fatigued
take a look at your lifts and all the
numbers and how you feel on them
you go pull downs golden prs bent rows
problems hamstrings pr's
for curls stiff like a deadlift good
morning problems
squats problems leg presses extensions
totally fine
you have a pattern the common
denominator there is the fact that your
axial
loading abilities involved that's a very
good sign of axial fatigue
and remember it's not systemic the
systemic affects everything everything
would be down
right a really interesting thing
justin this is more of like a sort of
coaching wisdom thing rather than a
super sciencey thing
you can usually feel it in your
perception of load
right so you can feel axial fatigue
especially if you're tuned to your
sensations as an athlete
when you unrack the squat bar especially
with your working weight
if you feel nice and rigid and
everything feels solid and you feel
strong and fast
and you're probably not very actually
fatigued
if you are very actually fatigued when
you unrack a squat
or try to pick up a deadlift you get
this like whoopee cushion
feeling where it's like you try to
unrack and you're like
right not a very warrior sound to make
that's just how your soul makes it
things feel like they're crushing you
they feel heavy the the load feels
insurmountable weights just feel heavier
than normal
in the deadlift a lot of times if your
axial fatigue is high enough
the bar doesn't just doesn't leave the
ground right normally you pull four or
five for sets of eight
you put 425 in the bar for a warm-up
because you're going a little heavy that
day and you go
and nothing happens but your legs are
fine your rowing is fine
you just your back just tries to round
over all the time and everything feels
super heavy
that's a very good sign your axial
fatigue is high
lastly systemic fatigue how can you tell
in an acute sense you can tell how much
an exercise
systemically fatigues you by testing an
unrelated muscle performance right after
for example
you want to find out sort of a
ridiculous experiment because you sort
of already know the answer
you want to find out if squats or leg
extensions
cause more systemic fatigue you do
this is what you do you do four sets
four hard sets of squats
one day and then afterwards you do a set
of max
curls okay what the hell do your biceps
have to do with squatting
nothing that's the whole point okay
we see we don't do our best on the
squats and we do our best in the bicep
so we see how good we do on biceps
a week later two weeks later something
we do leg extensions
four four sets max and then we do the
same bicep
same weight and see how many reps we can
get
if one of those squats or leg extensions
is really systemically fatiguing that
systemic fatigue is going to infect our
ability to do curls and those of you
have trained very hard before know
exactly what this feels like
someone offers you a workout and says
hey do you want to do squats deadlifts
overhead presses and then curls you'd be
like
after the squats and deadlifts alone i'm
not going to be able to overhead press
anything
because i'll be so smashed i'll feel
defeated my psychology
my physiology is going to be just
ridiculously just bashed in
and someone could be like yeah i hear
you but like what does the shoulder
press have to do with squat and you're
like well it's axial load and
systemic like okay well what about just
like a seated machine curl
if you guys ever had a small muscle to
work with after after you've hit your
big muscles
like a calf raise at the end of a big
leg workout or like a wrist curl at the
end of a big back workout and you look
at that small muscle exercise after you
beat yourself to death and you're just
like
nope you try to do it and you're so
tired you can barely get like five or
six reps when you normally get 10 if
it's in another place
that is systemic fatigue so the way you
can measure how systemically fatigue and
exercise is
see how much it affects unrelated
exercise if you do deadlifts first and
the rest of your workout sucks deadlifts
are real systemically fatigued
if you do stiff like another first and
the rest of your workouts pretty good
then they're not
if you do hamstring curls first the rest
of your workout is golden then you start
to see that ratio of systemic fatigue
if okay so it's not just any one given
muscle
another big thing is really it's going
to affect all muscles so when i say pick
the biceps
pick any other muscle that's unrelated
and it'll have the same exact fatigue
because you might have like oh my curls
are off but then your calf raises go
super super well
true systemic fatigue high levels of
fatigue everything sucks
everything else you suck at that you
normally do in addition to that
especially in cumulative so this is an
acute sense in the sense of like during
one workout
and this can also happen in an acute
sense but mostly happens in a cumulative
are the psychological symptoms you do
experience this in one workout but it
is you experience it just sitting around
not working out if it happens for weeks
and weeks and weeks excessive systemic
fatigue leads to
some psychological symptoms for example
this is a very very common one reported
a lot of literature
powerlessness like in i do mean in the
philosophical sense
like you someone's like hey you know
do you think like you can beat up a
space alien if he came down here and
threatened you
you're just bullshitting with your
friends hanging out and like you sort of
like connect with your feelings you're
like yeah
yeah yeah i'm fucking a space alien yeah
whatever i got him conor mcgregor right
i'll knock him out standing up
and if someone asks you the same
question and you truthfully and your
heart of hearts
feel what kind of answer like hey could
you beat up a space alien but you're in
week six of an accumulation or system of
fatigue is crazy
your honest feeling about how you would
do you'd be like
no it probably beat me up you're like
why like man i just i don't know i just
don't you just lose your mojo you lose
the
sensation that you are a person that can
get things done
right not the greatest thing in the
world especially in relation to training
and secondarily to that your desire to
train
is very predictably hampered when your
systemic fatigue is low specifically the
psychological component of it
you feel like you just want to tear shit
apart like at the end of a deal a week
you're like
let me in i want to eat weights metal i
just want to eat metal that's what i
want to do i want to lift the whole
world
when your systemic fatigue is really
high someone's like jim and you're like
what i don't ever want to see the gym
again you look at weights you're like
those things are just meant to hurt me
you feel deflated and you don't have any
interest in training whatsoever
that's not a bad thing at the end of a
mesocycle because your systemic fatigue
is supposed to be high
but if you aren't mindful of your
fatigue and you go for too long for too
long
that's really going to interfere with
training and all those other things
if you get really in the hole or in
other words your systemic fatigue gets
much higher
your sleep abnormalities are going to
start to present themselves two really
common examples
you have trouble falling asleep at night
and you
uh oh wait so sorry so one is you have
trouble falling asleep at night but
sometimes
you fall asleep really fast at night
like you just like watch the tv and you
knock out
unfortunately you'll have weird dreams
and you'll wake up a lot
that's one of them and another one is
you mysteriously wake up super early in
the morning for no damn reason at all
and you're just awake one of the reasons
is that as systemic fatigue rises part
of one of the responses
is cortisol this is part of the
inflammatory response cortisol goes up
cortisol is a stress response hormone
and it's actually just designed to keep
you awake
cortisol is normally high early in the
morning which is when people wake up so
you naturally you know like you
you sleep long enough at some point like
even if you're trying to sleep in you're
just like
laying in bed and you're like i'm awake
you try to close your eyes you're like
nah i'm awake with my eyes closed like
there's no more sleep to be had
that can happen much earlier if you're
overreached because cortisol is just
higher
so when it just starts to edge up it
gets higher earlier because there's a
whole lot of cortisol
secreted already and what ends up
happening is you're supposed to wake up
at 8 a.m
be super rested you fell asleep at
midnight just like you always do except
it was shitty sleep for last five hours
because of the sleep problems
and then you wake up at five in the
morning and you're like wide awake wide
awake and nervous
and pissed and feel powerless and don't
want to train
not a good not a good scenario but when
all these things happen together it's
pretty easy to tell they're happening
together i've been personally through
this a whole bunch of times at the end
of her mesocycle more or less
if you have more defined metrics you
know your resting heart rate can become
elevated
um you're more more likely to get sick
again from the immunogenic response
um and sometimes you don't have an
infection of any kind but you feel
pretty sick all the time and pretty sick
a lot of you uh are gonna know as soon
as i say what this feeling is
it's that feeling of of like um really
just out of nowhere weakness
where you're like want to get the remote
and you're like uh
you get up and move around people like
hey you want to go out and have fun
you're like no i don't i don't want to
do anything
right in this physical weakness that
you're feeling and if
there are various bacteria and viruses
present in your body at certain
concentrations
at the time that leads into actual
sickness but it doesn't have to you can
just sort of feel like you're pretty
sick for
hours sometimes days and longer at a
time right
so that's how you know that you have
systemic fatigue now
now that we know all the different kinds
of fatigue how do we interpret fatigue
we can take a bunch of different roads
here not all of them are correct we
could say fatigue is the worst thing
ever
and we never want to have it the problem
is any overloading stimulus also brings
with it fatigue
so if we say we never want any fatigue
we have to eliminate all overloading
stimulus not good
so fundamentally fatigue of most types
accumulates over the mouth cycle it just
does
and that's okay but the fundamental
question there is is how much fatigue
is too much because there is such a
thing as too much
so we can actually examine this at the
level of set to set fatigue
exercise exercise fatigue session to
session fatigue
and session recession leads into week to
week doing
okay so let's take it from the top
resting between sets how do you know how
much fatigue to drop
before you can do another set well it
turns out local fatigue
not caused by the nerve but caused by
the muscle itself is actually
hypertrophic
so that's really cool so what we want to
do is make sure that
our limiting factor in the next set is
going to be the local fatigue
which means that systemic and axial
fatigue have to be lower
than the local fatigue that is occurring
at the muscular level before you start
the next set so for example if you just
finished
a set of bicep curls and you feel like
oh you feel really defeated super tired
psychologically
you're breathing heavy okay and you
don't feel strong
it's not time to do another set yet
after a couple seconds couple minutes
you're gonna feel just fine your
breathing is no longer heavy
so your cardiovascular system is
probably not limiting your performance
anymore
your central nervous system and just all
the systemic stuff it seems to be pretty
good
you're ready to do another heart set and
then when you do your bicep curls close
to failure
you feel a deep burn and a deep
lack of local force that's limiting you
you don't feel weak unless you can't
really talk to your biceps you feel like
you're talking to them just fine
but then something in them is like oh
crap like they're really struggling
that's what you want almost all of your
sets
probably all of your hypertrophy sets
you want to feel
limited even if you don't stop at
failure a couple reps short
you want to feel the local muscular
limit coming
it's on its way it's super close like i
was doing hamstrings
earlier today and i was doing leg curls
for high reps which
awful hits the spot but it's awful
welcome to training
and i felt fucking jacked and i felt
super motivated
and or towards the end of my set like
i'm pushing and my hamstrings are
contracting
but this feels like there's this like
enlarging ball
inside of them of just uselessness and
tons and tons of lactic acid it's more
and more pain and the muscles just
doing that that's how you want a set to
end
not that you don't feel any of that and
you're just doing leg curls you're like
three five and then you get to seven
you're like you just stop and someone's
like
feel that in your hamstrings you're like
i don't know no like why'd you stop like
because like i ran out of breath there's
a good one or i just didn't feel like i
could keep going which is
very very much central fatigue systemic
fatigue not what you want
right so how do we know how to do
another set when we
know and this is through experience and
experimentation and perception of how
you feel and how your breathing is
when you know the muscle is going to be
the limiting factor again
then you're good to go and like we've
been through this before with rest times
um with your calves there's really not
much systemic anything going on
so you can do calves back to back to
back every 15 seconds and every set is
limited by the muscle itself
awesome but for something like squats
you might need to do four minutes of
rest between squats because otherwise it
just turns into pure cardio or something
like that
what about between exercises it's really
the same thing
between exercises is you rest as many uh
you know sets
as many minutes as it takes between
exercises so that when you start the
next exercise
it's not junk volume and you're still
pushing hard with your local muscles
right part of that is really interesting
part of the warm-up between exercises is
to get your nervous system
attuned and to get blood flow in the
area and to get your muscle fibers to
shift in their direction a bit
to get ready to make sure the muscle
itself is performing very highly
so that it is the limiting factor right
because if you
stop doing squats and just get on leg
presses do no warming up at other than
just start doing light presses your
working weight
you're gonna when your leg press set is
over you're not going to get as many
reps as you usually do
and it's going to be because you just
kind of like sort of got tired and it's
sort of like
someone could say like hey did you get a
lot out of your quads in the leg press
you're like yeah
i don't really feel like my quads really
sort of started to feel the groove and
turn on until like 10 reps into the shit
and then i had to stop at 15 because i
was tired
if you warm up and do you know five reps
at a lighter weight or at your working
weight and then take a rest
your quads are now more primed the
nervous system is more primed to milk as
much out of them as possible
so when you rest between exercises doing
a little warm-up set and resting some
more is almost always a good idea
between sessions monday and thursday you
train chest
how much does fatigue have to fall off
the answer is very simple
enough for you to at least match your
normal chest performance or probably
slightly exceeded to provide even more
overload
so if you normally bench 225 for 10
and on monday you did a bunch of flies
and incline presses and you beat up your
chest
if you get the thursday and you're doing
225 you can only hit six or eight
is that going to be overloading the
answer is not really because you're not
even pushing your muscles past their
normal abilities
right how are you supposed to stimulate
a really awesome adaptation if you're
too fatigued to literally do so
right it's like telling someone hey get
better at soccer except you can only run
a mile an hour but now
we're not even playing soccer anymore
right i'll get pretty good at running a
mile an hour
and sort of moving super slow through
the positions that's not soccer right
same idea your muscles have to be
recovered to give themselves not
at least an adequate effort and probably
a superlative effort on top of that
so how do you know if you're recovered
enough well if your performance is good
which is exactly where the mrv concept
comes from how to detect it is a lack of
performance
if you can no longer perform at a
certain level there's a good chance that
you're doing so much volume
you just can't recover on time and that
is why you need to back off do less
volume so on and so forth
right when the performance between
sessions
becomes a problem that is when
something should usually be done about
it a recovery session a recovery half
week
or a deload something has to push
something has to change
all right so taking all this together
what are the implications
for training first super simple one you
got to be aware of all three of the main
types of fatigue in your training if you
don't have
any estimate of axial fatigue if you
don't know when you're locally fatigued
or when you're systemically fatigued
you don't know what systemic fatigue is
not good because if you don't know what
these are you can't address them
individually and solve problems
right you might have a bad bicep workout
the rest of your week was good and
you're like i need a deload for my whole
body well that doesn't make any damn
sense only your biceps are fatigued
right
you might say oh man my legs are super
tired because my squats are in the
shitter but you notice
you don't notice that your leg presses
aren't a shader and it's really not your
legs that are fatigued it's your back so
you might be able to do something
different about that
still train your legs productively third
point here
you should minimize all sources of
needless fatigue and we'll have a tip
for how to do that in programming
recommendations but
anything in your training program design
that can be done another way that's just
a stimulative
but not as fatiguing is a good idea and
anything that's needlessly fatiguing is
a bad idea because fatigue interferes
with so much
it's not just free to us right it's cost
it's cost of muscle growth
definitely need to keep tabs on your
from outside of training fatigue
right keep that as low as possible keep
your life as drama-free as possible as
worry-free as possible
uh as little pointless physical work as
you can so for example
if you're really dedicated to growing
muscle someone can say to you hey you
know
you want to come and help me like garden
you know you like gardening i like
gardening come help me
you know till my garden for a bit and
we'll have some beers after
and you're like okay i got a leg workout
in like six hours you say hey can we do
gardening tomorrow
that's a really good idea right because
if you just spend a bunch of time bent
over and using your legs up and down for
gardening
you're gonna have a crappy leg workout
so you got to think these things through
if you want maximum performance
and maximum muscle growth maximize your
recovery strategies
another point get as much sleep as you
can get where all the sleep you need get
all the food you need get all the
relaxation practice good nutrition so on
and so forth
because that's going to take any unit of
fatigue you try to sum and reduce how
much the sum is
you have crappy sleep your accumulation
phase is three weeks long
you have great sleep it's five weeks
long that's two extra weeks of muscle
growth
really really really big deal right and
always keep tabs on your performance to
know when to back off
which is one of the reasons we preach
really good technique with standardized
technique
same range of motion for all the
exercises week two week to week so that
you know how many reps
and sets you did and how much weight you
did and you can tell yourself
objectively
did i perform better or worse this week
or last week you asked people you spot
them on the bench
and you're like how many reps are you
going for like i don't know like five
you're like how many did you do last
week they're like oh i don't know i did
a different exercise altogether like
sweet you'll have no idea if you're
getting better or worse
until it's just apparently clear that
you're super weak
lastly programming recommendations
first you want to choose high stimulus
to fatigue ratio exercises
and mind muscle connection
and try to work your technique to
improve it over time
you put your feet here on the leg press
last week and your knees kind of hurt a
little bit
maybe put a little bit lower maybe a
little bit higher maybe out maybe in
your knees feel better and all of a
sudden your technique is a little
different in such a way that leads to
less fatigue over time
improving your stimulus to fatigue ratio
axial fatigue for very strong people is
often limiting so be judicious with how
you pick your accident loading movements
first yes you might want to squat for
all your quad volume
consider squatting a bunch and doing
some leg presses as you get more
advanced and stronger consider doing
50 50 squats live presses as you get
even more advanced consider doing just a
few sets of squats and then a bunch of
leg presses after
and then as you get really advanced
consider doing your leg presses before
your squats
so that you have to use less spinal
loading to get the same stimulus to your
quads
and thus you sort of get i wouldn't say
the best of both worlds
but at least axial fatigue is not
limiting you anymore
a big part of keeping fatigue low is to
not chase weight for weight
on sake okay it's not the weight that's
making you better and more
jacked it is challenging the muscle at
the local level
so if you do full range of motion in a
high mind muscle connection
to feel that disruptive tension in the
muscle you can do that with
tons of weight if you do it really
poorly or you can do that with a
moderate amount of weight if you do it
really well
really easy comparison here is somebody
who's squatting 315 pounds
could be squatting more back than down
isn't really contracting their quads as
much there's no mind muscle connection
they're usually clearly using their
glutes and lower back a lot
they're cutting their depth so and so
forth you might be able to take a plate
off each side go to 225
teach them a real proper olympic
weightlifting high bar squat technique
teach them about the bodybuilding body
muscle connection slow down their
centric a little bit all of a sudden
every time they squat deep into the hole
their knees are super forward and
they're like oh my god i feel my quads
physically fucking tearing and that's
what we want with 225 pounds you were
using 315 before
if you chase weight chase we chase
weight it's good to get stronger from
hypertrophy training but the strength
should come from the training
it's not necessarily that you're using
more weight than makes you bigger
it is the becoming bigger that's
allowing you to lift more weight
so you should be focusing on doing as
many reps as it takes to get the reps in
reserve that you want for the set
and to make sure every single rep and
set is super high quality
if you get stronger that means you're
getting muscle if you're not getting
stronger that means you have some
questions to ask
but if you sacrifice high quality just
simply put more weight on the bar you
can pat yourself all fucking down the
back to tell you so i'm stronger
well congratulations are you any bigger
like well i think so
well how do you know you're bigger you
haven't been pushing your muscles harder
you've been pushing less hard actually
and you've been sort of cheating the
system and using more leverage and other
muscles and so on and so forth
so you don't even know if you're getting
bigger like well shit i guess you're
right so keep the focus on the muscles
and the good movement practices
let the strength come versus the other
way around
on a related note psyching up getting
real amped for a set
causes an unbelievable amount of
cumulative psychological fatigue so
most of the time and also a lot of times
it causes technical breakdown which
increases injury risk and
reduces your stimulus fatigue ratio
nothing good happens from there
in the first several weeks of your
program you probably should be psyching
barely at all
maybe on the most hardcore exercises
squats that lifts on and so forth
a little bit of a psych up would
basically on nothing else
maybe else maybe actually in the
hardcore movements you can benefit from
some psyching as
long as your technique is really good
but for the most part psyching up and
training is just not something
high-level athletes really do
psyching up into competition great but
you chose bodybuilding
so you don't even need a psychopath in
competition right it's just a beauty
pageant for lack of a better term
but if you're using hypertrophy training
for powerlifting something like that you
want to save your cycles
when you're doing doubles and triples
and especially you just want to save
your cycles for the actual platform
in training you want to do a really good
job psych up enough you know be awake
and alive and have an intent about your
actions
but don't lose your mind and start
thinking of your shitty childhood or
whatever the hell gets under your skin
you guys know what gets under my skin
all right
low reps in reserve at the beginning of
a mesocycle
and lower volumes so that we're getting
a really good bang for our buck and only
layering in more stimulus when we need
it
the last thing in the world you need is
a shitload of volume super close to
failure on week one of your motorcycle
you should ask yourself the question
do i need that to grow robustly at the
beginning of a meso when i'm super
sensitive to growth the answer is no
so why am i doing it you get a little
bit more growth sure but you get so much
fatigue
you get two or three weeks into your
measles you'll have to deload again and
do you grow during your deload not
really
right do you set up any growth with your
deload sort of but the setup is to allow
yourself to train hard more
but if you train so hard that you
essentially self-extinguish it's kind of
like trying to get the best marshmallow
possible except you put it into
like an arc an arc welder every time and
it just blows up and you're like well
okay
it's all black and disgusting and i
don't know what i'm doing wrong
right maybe if you turn up the heat a
little slowly you get exactly the
marshmallow that you want and then you
can take it out of the heat and eat it
right same idea with muscles we're not
there to destroy what is the the notion
there
um stimulate don't annihilate right and
that means in the first week of training
be easy with your reps in reserve your
muscles go really real level from really
minimal stuff
if they've been detrained for a week but
as you keep going and going going then
you layer on more and more and more we
don't want to front load a ton of
fatigue because it's going to gunk up
the works for the rest of everything we
do
right keep track of which muscles are
locally fatigued
and deload them when needed and not
technically a week deload but
a recovery session a light session right
sometimes your biceps are overreached
but you have two or three weeks
left of everything in your body to still
accumulate fatigue and you're totally
fine you're not remotely systematically
fatigued and nothing else is locally
fatigued
does that mean you need to take a full
deal for your biceps no way so know
which muscles are performing how and
sometimes when your biceps have reached
an mrv
and we'll talk about this in another
lecture you can pull back on your biceps
and not have to pull back on anything
else
right lastly always keep tabs especially
in the last weeks of accumulation on
your systemic fatigue
and remember this when your systemic
fatigue is high
only a full body systemic deload
probably for a good amount of time
like a week is going to actually reduce
your fatigue to a meaningful level
if you are not eating anymore lack of
appetite you're barely sleeping so on
and so forth you hate training
deloading just your biceps is not going
to cut it what you need is a week of
all muscles delivered at the same time
to bring down the fatigue like
crazy so that you're super pumped super
psychotic and ready to get after another
awesome accumulation
folks thank you so much for tuning in
see you next time
you
