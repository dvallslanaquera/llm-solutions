folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization
it's summertime and we have turned off
the air conditioning here
so that it wouldn't interfere with the
audio so enjoy the great audio while i
sweat to death
but while i'm dying let me talk to you
guys about
how to determine the number of exercises
that you do per session
per week and over the longer term of
your training people often ask like can
i just do squats forever for legs
or what is the benefit of doing a bunch
of different exercises for different
angles and stuff like that is overrated
underrated etc
let's talk about this from the
perspective of hypertrophy
before we can talk about specifics we
have to understand what the purpose is
of doing exercises and choosing
exercises
there's probably four purposes for
choosing exercises as far as i see it
number one is easy it's to deliver a
hypertrophic stimulus to the target
muscle
so if the hypertrophic stimulus is being
delivered you're good to go which is an
argument for not having to do
whole many exercises and usually one
good exercise
checks that box at least really well if
not perfectly
but there are other considerations you
want to minimize
fatigue while stimulating the muscle so
your stimulus to fatigue ratio is
important
so for example you could say squats
really grow my quads and someone could
say like so you just do 20 sets of
squats a week like yeah i would but i
would fall apart because the fatigue's
super high
so i do leg presses instead uh 10 sets
of the time so half it's leg press
not because squats are not stimulative
but because if i do too many of them
they become excessively fatiguing
totally fine reasoning
another consideration is that you want
to stimulate
all the fibers or as many of them as
possible on all the major areas of the
muscle not just some muscles have
different parts
the pecs don't always work as one whole
unit
especially optimally there's definitely
you know various parts of the pecs lower
part slash mid part and then the upper
part at least there's at least two parts
that may need more exercises people
often say like can i build
my best packs from incline venturing no
probably not you need some flat pressing
or decline pressing or some kind of
flat or decline work they say can i
build my pecs optimally from just flat
bench pressing again the answer is
probably not
right because many muscles like the pecs
have the sort of multiple functions or a
spectrum of function and not one
exercise is going to tax
and stimulate that entire muscles fibers
lastly you want to have enough variation
uh for the longer term in the program so
you could make this optimal program that
hits everything from different angle
tons of variation super high sfr
but you may be like it's for chest and
let's say you have six of your best
chest movements
and they're all in in the same month
okay three months later when some of
them get stale what do you replace
them with is the answer like not great
chest movements because yes you ran out
of great ones
so you have a couple of months of really
crappy training and then the
best sfr chest movements sort of refresh
drop their stainless and then you get to
use them again maybe if we didn't use
six chest movements
but we used four when two of them became
stale we could switch in two that were
super fresh and our top
tier winners and for sfr and then we
could continue that process so we never
have to do crappy pack training
it's sort of like going to your favorite
restaurant and ordering all of your
favorite meals at the same time
maybe like order one today and then one
tomorrow and that way they're always
tasty but there's a rotation in there
that keeps things fresh if you order the
same thing every single time and only
that
when it becomes stale you're not going
to have anything else left to order same
sort of idea
so what do these things mean for
how many exercises you should use for
hypertrophy
in one session one training session like
a monday for chest or something how many
exercises should you use
it's contrary to popular bro wisdom
which is an incline a flat a decline
and a fly and then a burnout drop
something or other
maybe not that many okay so here's the
deal the mind muscle connection
as sort of measured perceptively by the
tension and the burden target muscle
tends to improve within the first one or
two sets of an exercise
so if you just do one side of an
exercise then you move on to a different
exercise
your mind muscle connection is probably
okay on the first set it'll probably be
okay on the second set because it's a
different exercise
you'll just be okay the entire time but
after you use an exercise for one
two three working sets through that
entire time especially
after set one and after set two your
mind muscle connection
actually goes up and it may be better
than that your perceived
joint disruption might actually decline
look at the first set of benches always
a little awkward your shoulders kind of
feel
then you get warmed up you get really
grooved into that exact technique your
technique improves
and all of a sudden the second set is
like holy crap i really felt my pecs i'm
really grooving
if you use a ton of exercises in one
session
you never hit the groove because you do
want exercise and you go on to another
one
so you're always sort of relearning the
groove and you never really really uh
get the best sfrs potentially uh or
relative sfrs and you never really get
the best
effects over you know all the exercises
you could have done because you're just
trading off too many exercises to me
it's like um you know something you're
eating your favorite food you take one
spoonful you're like oh man this is
great you're excited to get that second
spoonful and someone just rotates in
another food you're like now it's
lobster and you're like
but i was eating mac and cheese like
nope sorry next food
again there's something to that momentum
effect right
number two if you still want to switch
machines
and switch implements because for some
reason your sfr is even better if you
switch all the time
skeptical right but if that happens
switching machines
means you have to rewarm up usually you
don't just hit like if you
go and bench you don't just go hit the
incline dumbbell
press with just your working weight
usually you want your working weight if
it's your working weight you're gonna do
it for a couple of field reps a
potentiation set
or many times for things like switching
from squats to leg press
you definitely just start warming up
again for leg press and at least do a
couple of warm ups because you don't
just run into a 600 pound leg press even
after doing squats it's going to feel
fucking awkward and the first set is
just going to be pure garbage if you try
it like that
that switching machines takes time
re-warming up takes time
and it adds systemic fatigue like if i'm
squat let's say you get an option for me
squat for four sets straight or do two
sets of squats and two sets of leg
presses bro
i'm not slapping 400 pounds on the
fucking squat just to take it off
two sets later and i'm sure as hell not
slapping 600 pounds on the leg press and
then just take it off two cents later
when i'm settled in
not only is that third set of squats
gonna feel maybe the best of all the
sets because i'm grooved in
it's gonna be like i don't have to take
all this weight on and put it off and
it's not just a laziness thing
that is systemic fatigue if you take on
and put off
hundreds of pounds of weights for no
good reason you could have just stayed
with the same machine or same exercise
that's a lot of systemic fatigue that's
going to cost you in really good
training that you could have otherwise
done
now on the other hand so this paints the
picture that
if we're doing like one two three even
maybe four sets per exercise
there's no good reason to switch but
after about five to seven sets of most
exercises in my experience and
experience of many of the folks that
i've consulted with
the mind muscle connection seems to
decline substantially
right um this can be helped by down sets
so if you do four sets of heavy squats
by the fourth set you're like i'm just
kind of moving around here
if you drop the load by like 10 to 20
percent your sfr might get boosted but
that usually doesn't
buy you another four sets of squats it
might buy you like two sets of squats
so once you've done oh four five
six sets of squats usually any doing any
more than that
is like your sfr is just not going to be
that great
and now switching to a new exercise can
have a net
better stimulus to fatigue ratio because
of the novelty
because you've essentially developed a
short term staleness to that exercise
that you've been using
so within a session because of these
constraints
you know if at the end of a mesocycle
you predict that you're going to be
doing no more than five to seven sets
for the muscle group in the session like
let's say biceps you train them four or
five times a week
you're never going to do more than like
six sets of biceps you start with two
sets of biceps and you slowly work up to
six over the meso
if it's only six sets of biceps which
means by the way let's say it's two sets
on the first week
you don't have to do two exercises as a
matter of fact it's not just don't have
to
you should probably just stick with one
because you know if you get up to six
sets it's still not too many sets for
the sfr to really fall
it's up there though not super
sustainable but that's okay you deload
after that but most of the meso
your average volume for biceps per
session might be like four
four sets bro you don't need two
exercises for that that's great grooving
on just one exercise because you train
your biceps four or five times a week
you left plenty of opportunity to do
different exercises on different days
you don't need to rotate through five
different exercises every day people do
that all the time i think maybe because
it's just bored
or they think there's something magical
there but i think they're probably
missing out
however if you anticipate that at the
end of a mesocycle
you're gonna be doing maybe five to
twelve sets at the end of the meso
then you know two or three exercises
is probably what you're going to want to
pick usually two three is probably
overkill but in some instances three is
a decent idea
you want to do the exercises that you
get the best sfr from
so if that means you feel like you're
rotating exercises too much
like your back workout has 12 sets in it
you're doing three exercises and you're
like
you know man i don't need to go to pull
downs after assisting pull-ups i would
just rather do more assistant pull-ups
and more rows
than your golden but if you do four sets
of rows four sets of assisted pull-ups
and you're like man there's no way i can
do any more of these exercises then yeah
four sets of pull-downs at the end
is a wise idea so if you have a higher
volume
per session split it into two or three
exercises totally fine
if you have a lower volume procession
just one exercise is often a pretty
decent idea
you'll notice that the recommendation
for one exercise is if you peak at five
to seven sets
the recommendation for two to three
exercises if you peek at seven to twelve
cents
they say what the hell is seven there's
no correct answer for seven there's
some nuance there if you peak at seven
it could be one exercise
is a good idea it could be two is a good
idea and it's really your call
based on the best stimulus to fatigue
ratio and excess movement that you don't
want to do for your exercise your muscle
group your situation
next how many exercises should we learn
about per session
it's basically one to two exercises
often one what about over the course of
the week
and let's mind you per muscle group
let's examine what this looks like
so first of all we highly recommend you
do the same exercises every week of a
given mesocycle
so same exercise whenever you get a
single meso so this advice is per
mesocycle as well so not only does this
advice apply per week
it applies essentially per month per
four to eight week mesocycle
accumulation phase and then a deload
phase
here's the thing you want to cover most
of your muscles
functions main functions through the
meso in
each meso okay in each mesocycle or
rather
in each microcycle as well in each week
you probably want to hit the main
functions of the muscle
not a hundred percent but we'll get to
that in a second so for example
you should probably have an exercise or
at least consider an exercise
for your pecs that occurs at least once
a week
that puts stretch uh the pecs in a
stretch tense position so something deep
like pressed
you probably want an exercise for the
peak contraction like machine flies or
cable flies or something like that
because it's a slightly different
function the stretch under load
and you probably want an exercise that
uh targets not just the main
packs the sternal packs which is the
middle and lower packs but you also want
to target the clavicular packs the upper
packs with some kind of probably incline
movement
if you're training hamstrings you should
consider a movement that's hip hinge
like stephanie dad of good morning
and knee flexion like lying leg curls
seated leg curl so on and so forth
because these are different functions
and cover different parts of the muscle
if you just train one of them you might
not
be getting the full benefits triceps you
want something to extend
the upper arm okay so this kind of thing
which can also be if you lock your arms
back here
hit the long head and also the other two
heads of the triceps are hit with
extending the lower arm you should
probably have some of both
cool thing is vertical pulling already
trains your long head which is really
nice
so sometimes that means just extending
the lower arm is totally fine
but if you don't have a lot of vertical
pulling maybe you can do some overhead
tricep work
so on and so forth now here's the deal
people think okay
every single men's cycle i have to do i
have to cover the major functions of
each muscle that's not true
taking a break from overhead tricep work
for example is fine
for many many mesos because the pulling
work will do just fine
muscles don't just shrink away when you
don't use their various very intricate
parts they shrink away if you don't
train them at all
so while you may get some really good
quad results for a short time through
leg extensions that you wouldn't get
through squats and leg presses
if you don't do letting extension for a
while that probably means you'll just
maintain
that specific muscle area you hit with
leg extensions
and grow everything else so there's a
trade in and out that can occur
you don't need to cover all of your
muscle function bases every single meso
it's just that if you go like two or
three blocks without covering one of the
functions someone could say eh why don't
you do you know this kind of function
for the muscle why why haven't you done
incline processing in quite a while so
well i've been prioritizing mid packs
and low packs totally cool
but at some point you're going to want
to prioritize your upper packs because
they're going to want to be brought up
so on and so forth
now for a good structure for the week to
occur
when enough variation to happen for high
stimulus to fatigue ratios and no more
okay does that mean you have to do a
different movement every single day that
you do that
muscle group no you can repeat movements
but usually you should do it in
different rep ranges
because that allows a boost in sfr if
you do heavy squats on monday
heavy squats again on wednesday that
wednesday session the stimulus the
fatigue ratio is probably not going to
be that great
your muscles are a little bit used to
that sort of when a monday training
and it's a lot of tension on the same
same exact tension same exact joints
you're going to develop a little bit
more wear and tear but if you do heavier
squats monday lighter squats wednesday
there's a difference
through novelty and through not as much
wear and tear of the exact same forces
and so on and so forth
you could get a little bit of an sfr
boost most people
when they do a different movement will
either do when they train properly a
lighter version of that movement later
in the week or a heavier version usually
lighter
and or just do a different movement that
being said
we don't want to just burn variation
want to use no more variation than is
needed if you do barbell bent rows
monday heavy
barbell bent rows wednesday light and
machine or like let's say cable rose
uh friday light for your horizontal
pulling for your back
and someone's like shouldn't you be
doing on wednesday instead of light bent
rows like some other exercise and you
feel like dude bent rows messed me up
monday
they're amazing on wednesday and then
the little bit of a difference on friday
for the cable roses
everything i need then it's great
because all the other machine rows and
dumbbell rows or whatever
you can keep on the back burner or
actually keep away in the closet so to
speak
and when you the bank rows aren't
feeling any good when their sfrs start
to drop or the cable rose
you have all these exercises to use so
doubling up is totally fine
if you still get a high sfr out of it
don't feel like because it's a new
session you have to use
a new exercise where that leaves us
is with a recommendation of using
roughly two to five exercises per muscle
group
per week okay there are some
complexities to that
because some muscle groups are really
kind of two very different
functions and probably require more than
this the easy example is the back
two to five means you should probably be
using like
one to three horizontal moves probably
two to three horizontal moves per week
and two to three vertical moves per week
right that can mean
that it's the same exercise repeated
over and over or actually new exercises
right so this number is a little bit
higher for very complex muscle groups
like the back but for most muscle groups
chest triceps biceps quads etc
that two to five range really does apply
it's something like
two or three with lower frequencies
right so if you train quads twice a week
gee you could just use squats on one day
and leg presses on the other and be
totally fine
if you train your biceps five times a
week or six times a week
you might need to do a different
exercise every time or
every other time thus getting up to like
maybe even five uh exercises per week
because if you just repeat that exact
exercise three days in a row or
something
it's going to toast you it's not going
to be high sfr nothing good really comes
of that
so what about over the macro cycle and
we've covered this in other detail
lectures before
but this does definitely belong in this
discussion
how do you treat exercises over the
macro cycle should you be changing them
strategically for some way or another
there's
way more advanced lectures that we've
given on this but a simplified version
is this
if your exercises that you're using are
still progressing you're not being hurt
on the joints and their stimulus to
fatigue ratios are still awesome
do not trade them out keep them in i
have done
up until this meso which i'm actually
talking to you guys right now
this is the first mesocycle in
a year in which i haven't done the high
bar barbell squat
holy shit why the hell did i trade it
out sooner because it's sfr was amazing
and it's just anything i could have
replaced it with wasn't that's good
right but if you stop progressing on an
exercise especially for a mesocycle and
especially if it's not like a fat loss
phase and you just haven't progressed on
anything
if the exercise has begun to hurt you
like you're squatting and your knees
hurt and the next time you're squatting
your knees hurt even more then even more
but leg press is fine
maybe time to move away from the squat
for a little while and
if the exercise has declined in
opportunity cost
sfr what god's name does that mean
so opportunity cost is a term from
economics
that it's the cost it's not really a
cost it's
the the benefit you would get doing
something that you're not doing right
now
so the opportunity cost of going to eat
italian food tonight is that you don't
get to have chinese food right so
anytime you think oh what do i want
someone's italian like that sounds good
but
egg rolls egg rolls are opportunity
costs if you go to a shitty italian
place your friend drags you to and
you're eating
garbage fucking watery pasta you're like
fuck i'm paying five good egg rolls an
hour for this shit
right that's what opportunity cost is
but when you've chosen an exercise
that's still pretty good because that
pasta could be decent right
your bent rows are feeling fine but you
know that if you chose one arm rows
instead
because your bent rows have been getting
a little bit more stale they're still
good just more stale than they were
the one arm rows their sfr is now higher
usually one arm rows sfr is below right
but you haven't been using them for a
while so their sfr is all at full
potential
bent rows you've been using since sfr
started higher it was a better exercise
and
just dipped below so if the opportunity
cost of doing another exercise
is positive that is to say there's
another exercise you could be doing
that's better from a stimulus fatigue
ratio perspective
probably a good time to thread this
exercise out and choose that new
exercise
because if you ever say like someone's
like how was your back work hard you're
like that was good bent rows
they're like why don't you do one arm
rows you're like uh because that would
give me an even better workout
that's a fucking stupid thing to say
like why the hell did i do one arm rows
now there is something to say
for momentum which is why in that uh
little uh
guide here if you're progressing on bent
row still even if the sfr isn't amazing
but still very good
if you're progressing you're just adding
weight adding weight adding weight
adding reps
i wouldn't stop that sort of thing keep
going especially if the progress is
great
now if you could progress even faster
with antiquing worm rose that's a
consideration so if your sfr is
really pretty low even if you're still
progressing in strength i would say it's
time to trade it out but
have that momentum thing in mind so it's
not like as soon as you're like oh
that rose would be fun start oh sorry
one arm rows would be great
don't just start doing them if you're
getting great momentum and strength keep
it for a little while but when the sfr
drops
a little bit lower and the sfr of the
other exercise you could be doing is
higher it's probably time to rotate that
in
next one do this process but
through the replacements that you do
stick to your best
five to ten highest sfr exercises and
rotate them in and out for the most part
that doesn't mean you don't branch out
to new exercises
or to old exercises that you used to do
you don't do anymore
you should branch out every now and
again to give them a shot so normally
you would do squats and leg presses and
lunges
chuck man having the leg extensions in a
while let me give them a shot that's
totally fine
and it's when you do give them a shot
try to really play with the technique
especially if you start them during a
deload
the first microcycle of a meso try to
play with a technique that
maximizes sfr don't just do the exercise
and be like the extensions still suck
try a little wider try a little narrower
try to curl your toes up
so on and so forth different rep range
different cadence and like oh i actually
found a
really good way to work the leg
extension is a really really high sfr
but that being said when you are
reaching out when you are trying some
new exercises
don't think you have to do this all the
time okay you are not missing out on
crazy growth
by not trying a new exercise every mezzo
most of your exercises that you do
every single meso should be the tried
and true ones rotated in and out every
now and again
when you feel like it you can try new
exercise but don't do this compulsively
okay just squats and leg presses for
example can give you like 99 of all the
quad size you'll ever have
okay can that doesn't mean you have to
only use them but
if you feel like oh if i don't use this
new weird variation i'm never going to
be
jacked bullshit if people got super
jacked with just barbells and dumbbells
you don't need a trillion different
machines for sure
here's another consideration again
opportunity cost trying dumb shit
is time spent not growing from
guaranteed shit so for example let's say
you're visiting a gym you're all right
let's try this new weird leg press that
i've never seen before
you do five sets on it you're like my
knees hurt my quads aren't popped this
sucks
but they had a squat rack and you're
like i could've had a fucking great
squat workout
why'd i do that right so when you have
tried and true exercises
it really lowers the incentive for you
to try super different ones you should
on occasion but that occasion
shouldn't be very often but if you have
exercises you know
are awesome you've done them before
you're grooved into them you're
progressing
man it's going to be hard for anyone to
pull them away from you
and that's for the best like when i
travel to some gyms
i travel a bunch of places sometimes
like a weird shoulder machine and then
they have a pair of dumbbells and i'm
like
you know what i'm going to go with the
dumbbells because that thing looks like
a fucking disaster
and i don't want to piss away my workout
or sometimes i'll try like one or two
sets in it as a warm-up and i'm like
this is straight garbage
and i'll do dumbbells instead be like
but you have dumbbells at home yeah no
shit and they train me the best at home
and they trade me the best on the road
right
so next to last
you want to stick to your highest sfrs
right and on occasion you want to try
new stuff
and sort of thread into this whole theme
don't do it compulsively oh
i should try new stuff it has to be a
good reason has to be a reason to try
new stuff
and the way you get real jacked is
getting stronger over time on your
highest sfr
exercises the top five to 10 over the
years if you do this you will be jacked
and there's not
one weird pack exercise you're not doing
to unlock your games i don't give a shit
what some
crazy ass youtuber says about that
here are a few examples just look at
these if you want to pause the video and
look them
look at them it's not rocket science for
chest
you can cover most of your bases if you
do chest twice a week let's say monday
thursday
you do incline press on monday followed
by cable flies okay that covers the
incline portion and the peak contraction
portion
and then thursday you can do flat
dumbbell press and dips it covers the
horizontal portion
and the bottom sternal portion you're
good to go quads you could do squats on
monday
here's just another option but these are
not instructions are just examples
one of the many ways of doing things
correctly wednesday you could squat
lighter okay a bit of a different feel
but you're saving a lot of variation
and then friday you can do hack squats
this is good stuff is using the same
exercise but different rep ranges
is especially great for folks that train
in limited gyms like if you're at a
crossfit gym if you're at a hardcore
power lifting gym if you're at home gym
you're trying to maximize hypertrophy
you don't have a trillion machines to
use and some people think like i need a
new exercise every time
good god good luck doing that shit at
home or in a power lifting gym or in
someone's garage
if you're at gold's gym venice or if
you're at you know powerhouse in season
new york pop francis
you could do a different machine every
fucking year of your life and never find
the same machine again
but it's just not the case so sometimes
these strategies work and then for back
we get an example
of pretty high frequency four days a
week of back monday we do pull-ups
tuesday barbell rows thursday one
exercise of machine
pullovers right one of these and
pull-downs but the pull-downs here are
different grips
than the pull-ups monday so there's some
variation there which is really really
good for both stimulus
and fatigue management and saturday you
do machine rows again different exercise
so we have a bunch of different
exercises in this but you use different
grips than used for the barbaros tuesday
instead of like gripping the machine
like this you grip it like this
something you can't do with a barbell
and it's a little bit of variation a
little bit of bare stimulus better
fatigue
folks give this stuff some thought and
remember do the exercise number that
gets you the best
training not some magic number you think
is a good idea whether that be super low
so don't make the mistake of being like
just squat bro don't do stupid shit like
that
squatting is fine live pressing is great
too on the other hand
don't be a person looking for magic
exercises and thinking like if i don't
do 16 exercises per session
like mr olympia i'm never going to be
jacked because that's also bullshit
folks
thanks for tuning in see you next time
