hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization
i wonder how many times i can make the
same identical introduction
without uh just becoming confused as to
where i am anyway
fat loss dieting means simple video
number ten hopefully you've seen the
other nine if not please click because
every time you click we get money
and again just to remind you not to be
paying i do need more lamborghinis at
all times
video number 10 how to get exotically
lean
exotically lean what the hell does that
mean and why are we interested so last
time we took a nine video tour
through the entire process of fat loss
setting up a diet executing recovering
from one so on and so forth
and now you may very well be super sharp
at the process ha
it's a little pun there with the fat
loss in your sharp anyway
cool good enough but
what if just for shits and giggles you
want to get exotically lean
what does that mean exactly under 10
body fat for males
really exotics like in the five-ish area
and under 17
body fat for females in the 12-ish areas
usually where shit gets really crazy
that means by the way veins
usually visible veins ripped abs and no
visible fat stores at that level you do
not have love handles you just have
all kinds of interesting sculpture
shapes if you want to go that route
we have five good tips for you they're
very important because this is a
very different endeavor than just
getting lean here we go
first it's not for everyone there is no
good reason to do it
outside of for art okay if you're a
professional bodybuilder i'd say make
your money finance a career but almost
nobody is
so it's literally just an artistic
venture there's some cool shit you want
to do
you know like if you look at an artist
painting a weird ass mural you know that
if you're on enough mushrooms looks like
a donkey
you're like ah why would you do that and
he's like what's ours you're like
okay that's it it's it's own reward
okay so if you want to paint your body
so to speak into a lean chisel machine
sweet but a lot of times people think
there's this sort of rainbow at the end
uh or there's you know pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow and they think
should i get exotically lean
literally have people ask me that i'm
like i don't know do you want to and i
don't know
well i can't tell you what you want you
know um
i would say getting exotically lean is
like buying uh
an analogy for females it's like buying
a really expensive dress
okay if you really like the dress and
you want to see yourself in it
sure that's worth 800 or whatever i
don't know how much dresses cost
good god uh but if you look at the dress
and you're like
and someone's like don't you just want
to buy that you're like no should i no
of course not right
that's all exotic lena is it's just a
cool little trick it's painful it's
terrible it's terrifying it comes with
tons of side effects
it's not unhealthy but it sure as hell
throws you through your lube if it's
worth it to you for art great if not
just being lean is cool enough and just
being anything else is fine too number
two
some things to expect your hunger levels
will be insane at the end your energy
will be
super low so you expect it which means
you eat
way more bland foods than anything else
tasty foods goodbye towards the end of
that process
you have to make sure you're as active
as always because your body is just
going to try to get you lay down
sit or just like huddle up in blankets
so
make sure step tracker is a really good
idea make sure physical activity is
always there and it'll make the process
way easier way better
and of course here weight training is a
must if you're trying to go for exactly
without weight training you're going to
look like
i no offense no offense kate moss from
the 90s model from 90s or like william
defoe or something like that
uh you know gee whiz it's a cool look
it's interesting but it doesn't exactly
look like
maybe the healthiest thing in the entire
world um i'm sure william defoe is a
fine health kate moss i have no idea
so uh you don't just want to look skinny
emaciated
you want to look jacked and lean and
ripped so weight training is key
critical at least i would say three or
four sessions a week possibly more
next for most people to get exotically
lean it takes at least two distinct
diets once they are
rather lean or in just generally good
shape first diet
gets you lean and it may take several
diets to get you lean but generally
speaking if you're already pretty lean
the first diet gets you lean lean
okay striking distance and then
you take a maintenance phase to cool off
and then the next diet
takes you the rest of the way all the
way to exotic it's like a multi-boost
rocket or something like that right like
you know the saturn v rocket that pushed
the astronauts to go on the moon
there's like the first phase it's crazy
and then the first phase detaches and
sort of nothing happens for a little bit
that's maintenance phase and the second
phase starts because there's no one
phase rocket to get you to go to the
moon or at least there wasn't back in
the day
so you have to have both phases and you
have to plan for how long that takes so
here's the deal
usually it's going to take at least nine
weeks per diet to get you super lean
and there's two diets and a maintenance
phase that means nine plus nine plus
nine
27 weeks total to get exotically lean so
here's the thing
a lot of people think like i'm pretty
good shape how long do i have to diet
or how much time do i have to allow
myself in the future to get like
shredded exotically crazy psychotically
shredded
27 weeks okay uh and potentially if you
want to really take your time
36 weeks okay this is not new it's not
it's not crazy at all
the guys some of our colleagues at 3d
muscle journey i encourage you to view
the youtube channel it's amazing 3dmj
they have regularly their clients
winning bodybuilding shows in the
natural bodybuilding space
front back and center these guys are
winning shows and their total diet
length they have tons of maintenance
phases in there
is like 40 weeks 50 week diets now the
whole thing's not hypocaloric there's
tons of maintenance phases in there but
that's what it takes to get super
exotically lean
and there's nothing wrong with that if
you're already very lean can you diet
for nine to twelve weeks oh yeah sure
and you'll be on a bodybuilding stage
but most people are not already very
lean
prepare for a long time and squish a
maintenance phase in between there at
least
that is gonna get you where you go
because a lot of people start decently
in decent shape
and they get to like eight weeks out of
exotically lean and they're like i've
been dieting for 16 weeks and i'm going
to die
and then the last eight weeks just never
happens right and then they balloon back
up and it's all down the drain but if
you know to expect it you don't die for
16 you die it for nine
maintain for nine diet for nine and
voila you have
abs on your face whatever the hell
exotically looks like
next consider a coach it's a big deal
dieting for exotic leanness presents all
kinds of weird trippy challenges
your willpower is going to be this tiny
little mouse right compared to the huge
elephant it used to be
and coaches can be incredibly helpful
especially in the final weeks of the
diet keeping you
sort of in check they can guide you on
cardio
specifics questions salt intake water
intake especially
look your best at the very end because
you can look really good after exotic
cleaning fat loss phase if you're
carrying a bit of water and salt
but if your coach really helps you with
that last part and you want to take some
really awesome pictures
they can peek you in such a way that you
look unbelievable look if you're going
to diet for exotic leanness
you might as well look unbelievable at
the end versus just really good and you
might as well get some awesome pictures
so
consider a coach very much so um i don't
coach anymore so don't look at me
i'm never very good coach anyway um i
guess i just coach my friends now
i coach charlie that's why coach if you
know who that is you know that is um
but uh you know we have tons of coaches
at rp that can do that specifically
jared feather and his team jared father
samuel canola
and our physique coaches but then
there's you know dozens of other great
coaches
uh peter fitchen is somebody you can
look up eric helms and his team at 3dmj
eric trexler i could go on and on and on
tons of people can help you
look them up get a good coach it'll sort
you out
lastly you have to take a maintenance
phase after getting exotically lean
because your number one
you know just sort of rough guess at
what you're supposed to be doing
is like liquefying pizza and iving it
into yourself
that's how hungry and starving and
psychotic you're gonna be
it's a good idea to ease back into food
afterwards
so that you stop it exotically lean
exotically lean
and then through easing back in and of
course having some cheats and so on and
so forth all very much like the
maintenance phase we talked about in the
early videos
you end up at regular lean instead of
exotic lean to just back to where you
are okay cause
if you get exotically lean you can
actually get back to regular lean and
sustain it that's one of the cool
benefits of exotic leanness
but if you get back there and then just
go do fuck all
you'll end up as just regular like you
used to be and it's kind of like hey
remember when you were super lean you're
like yeah i do remember that
don't remember what it's like though
because i'm back to normal you could at
least get super lean after
not exotically and that's really really
good right
do your best be consistent be patient
and lastly and most importantly no
matter what body fat level you're at
enjoy yourself
because here's the deal being lean
doesn't guarantee happier
it just guarantees lean it's on you to
choose the things and the hobbies and
the friends and the lifestyle that makes
you happy
and if leanness is a part of that
fucking sweet and if it's not
no big deal folks with that ultra
motivational message
see you later see you for the next video
series which starts
we'll see hopefully next week maybe the
week after peace
you
