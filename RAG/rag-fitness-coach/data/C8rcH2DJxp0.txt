hey folks dr mike isratel here
today people have told me that i say my
last name too fast and might not even
know it
but i studied it real hard and i
pronounced it today
we are going to talk about how to gauge
how many reps in reserve you are in
hypertrophy training
so that you can figure out how far from
failure you are and perhaps get better
at the training process
it's a much maligned thing this rar a
lot of times people say
you know i really just don't know if i'm
at three reps in reserve or one rep or
five
how do i tell we've got first some tips
as to how you can tell
and then we actually have tips as to why
being super accurate
isn't really that necessary so let's get
into it first of all what is
reps in reserve and why is it rir
reps in reserve it's essentially how
many reps you have in the tank with good
technique
until you reach what's called technical
failure like if you have to wiggle or
something like that or break your
breaker form break your technique
doesn't count so it's how many reps you
have until you have uh
all the way to technical failure and
generally speaking this is a concern to
us at all
because researchers found over and over
and over again and also most
people who trained for hypertrophy have
found this to be very true in their own
training that
anything relatively close to failure
about three reps in reserve and closer
is just really effective for hypertrophy
and the opposite is not true that
anything further than three year
observation failure it's just much less
effective so if you stop all of your
sets at like
six reps in reserve you just don't get
very good hypertrophy relative to if you
go closer
the good news is is that anything
between three reps in reserve and going
all the way to failure or close to zero
reps in reserve
research can't even tell apart if it's
any better so we know for a fact that
for most people
it's just not that big of a difference
if any difference at all but
at least you've got to be able to tell
if you're around three years in reserve
or significantly more or less than that
so why is gauging reps in reserve
important
for a couple of reasons if we train at
more than three reps in reserve
consistently and that means
further away from failure like six reps
away from failure
then we just aren't training hard enough
to maximize gains uh this has been
confirmed in beginners there's a couple
of studies and one really really
important one
that basically showed that you take
beginners and you tell them hey go to
failure and tell us when you have like
one or two reps left in the tank
and they do benches or squats or
something and they get really tired they
go okay i like i have like one more left
and then the researchers start yelling
at them like crazy really get under
their skin they don't help them
but they really really motivate them
more more more do one more you got it
and a lot of folks got like five and ten
reps
more after that it was really insane so
we know that beginners underestimate how
close to failure they are
it's probably not as true for advanced
intermediate individuals but
you just don't want to be one of these
people that thinks they're going really
close to failure
and then you actually get pushed by
someone who you're maybe you're trained
with an old training partner that came
back and he really pushed you on the leg
press
the guy i got sets of 15 last time this
time i got sets of 22.
uh i thought i was two reps in reserve
last time that just clearly wasn't true
unless i gained like five reps of
strength i don't know where which
didn't so you don't want to be that
person that's just not been training
hard enough so it's good
to make sure you know rr relatively well
if you can't tell on the other end what
like three reps in reserve is versus
like what zero is then you may be
training too hard all the time and
that's not the bad thing
it's just accumulates a lot of fatigue
let's say week one of a mezzo cycle you
want to push hard but not too hard so
you have something to save for the later
weeks
and you know your program says like we
should be about three reps in reserve
if what you think is three reps in
reserve is actually like one rep in
reserve
then you're just gonna peter out and
accumulate a ton of fatigue after two or
three weeks and wonder why you're not
making excellent gains and wonder why
you're so tired
and wonder why you can't make pr's we've
all been around people
who like will ask us to watch a set or a
spot
and they're like i'm going for like
three reps in reserve got it you're like
sweet and then they get to like
the bar like basically stops and they
grind out the last rep and then they
rack and they turn around they're like
pretty good right you're like i'm pretty
sure that was zero reps in reserve man
they're no no i had a couple more like
no you didn't
liar right we don't want to be that
person because we setting ourselves up
for essentially just a lot of
sub-optimal training and a lot of
surprises
of like oh man i'm too much too fatigued
to keep going why what's because we've
been pushing too hard
for way too long so we need to be able
to tell a couple of things really three
things one
about what three reps in reserve looks
like because that's our sort of bottom
threshold for hard enough training
we need to be able to tell what about
zero reps in reserve looks like because
we
should know when you know when next week
would be like no bueno or when one more
rep would just fall on us especially for
things like the squat
and bonus round is it's good to be able
to tell a little bit between those two
some sort of sort of internal
discrimination there
where like you know it's good to be able
to tell what three and
one rep in reserve is it's gonna be able
to tell between two and zero reps in a
reserve
anywhere between those two and one
represent reserve you may not very
accurately be able to tell but you
should have an inkling of like is this
three or is this two or is this one at
least you'd be able to have a good guess
versus just being like it's either three
or zero or i have no idea
so it pays to know what ri are you at
so what are some ways to gauge rir what
are some good tips well the first thing
is the tips we're gonna say in point
number two here
don't apply to everyone equally there's
a really big range of differences
in how people experience reps in reserve
some people for example on the point of
velocity we know bar velocity and we'll
talk about that in a sec bar velocity is
a very very good way
to tell how many reps you have in the
tank essentially when the bar starts to
slow down
it probably means you're roughly three
reps in reserve or so the thing is for
some people
they go completely and a lot of times
very strong very big people that are
very fast twitch and have athletic
backgrounds
they'll move the weight at about the
same speed and then they'll hit
zero reps in reserve and it'll still
look great and they'll they'll fail and
just falls on them you're like what the
hell your bar speed was amazing this
entire time
how is it you just went to failure and
then there's other folks
usually smaller people usually more slow
twitch people that like their last seven
reps of a set
looks like insane grinders and then they
just keep going and you're like all
right three more and they just do three
like
and then they're like four and five and
six you're like holy crap like first of
all it's miserable to be you because you
can just keep going
but also you know what my guess at what
your 3r was was pretty wrong
so everything in between those two is
also true so we have to take these
things with grains of salt
and a lot of this comes down to learning
your own body and this can be different
muscle to muscle
like you know your biceps might just
stop completely at a halt
your triceps might be able to grind
stuff so you have to have some nuance
when you're approaching these but
in general here are some helpful tips
around three reps in reserve
you begin to experience the following
things usually on average so again you
have to learn your body
to really figure this out we'll talk
about later how to do that the bar speed
will begin to notably slow
so if you're doing benches it's like
boom boom
okay that first time it slows down on
you
you know you're not six reps in reserve
in most cases
and the first time it starts to slow
down on you in most cases it's not like
that's it that sets over
zero rar once the bar slows down you
probably have a few more reps left
a few more like three right second
in especially higher rep sets lactic
acid
accumulation in the burn will sort of
ramp like this so it'll be
sort of sustainable feels pretty good
and then right around three reps in
reserve around there
the burn starts to get really crazy
you're like ah this sucks
right another good tip and if you note
those together both velocity and burn
now you have two measurements you have a
more accurate big picture
you know if the velocity starts to slow
down but there's no burn are you really
three reps in reserve maybe if the other
happens if there's a burn but no
velocity slowed down then you got more
reps but if they both start to happen
you start to think okay i'm getting
pretty close to failure maybe about
three ups in reserve
another uh indicator is that a lot of
focus needs to be required to keep good
technique
you might have your technique locked in
place when you get to that 3r mark
your body just starts to push like you
might be able to keep your elbows in a
close grip bench
when you start getting close to three
reps in reserve you start to flare your
elbows unconsciously
and you have to be like okay okay okay i
really just gotta focus
okay really focus and really push at the
same time it gets really really tough
because your body essentially at 3r
starts to go into survival mode of like
i just have to get this weight off of me
okay so if you your technique normally
comes easily to you and you don't have
trouble focusing on it
when you push closer to failure through
episode observer so you're going to
start to be like oh wow like i really
need to keep a cap on my technique
otherwise it just goes to hell
and lastly and this is something that
for intermediates and advanced lifters
they're very good at perceiving
beginners are going to have tough time
perceiving this which is one of the
reasons why we don't even tell beginners
to go to failure
is you're going to experience a sense of
sort of psychological
and local weakness in the muscle and in
the movement that you're doing
kind of a good way to describe it would
be that the weight is pushing back at
you more
like you know you're doing again benches
the easy example from sitting here at a
chair right
you're doing bench and it's like whoosh
you're just in charge you're moving the
weight
and then three rir and this exactly
correlates to that velocity decline
feels like the weight just kind of got
heavier it's like like the weight
really starts to just grind back at
you're like all right wait i see you
you know it's no longer like you're no
longer winning the battle it's like 50
50.
and eventually at failure you lose the
battle right so in another way
like three rar somewhere taking all
these things together where
it feels like shit starts to hit the fan
like it feels cause you know if you do
something like six
rrr 10 reps in reserve 10 reps away from
failure
you could hypothetically feel like i
could just do this forever right you're
like
this is super easy but when you hit 3r
that's the sort of the first time
that you realize man you know like
this i'm not going to be able to do this
forever the time is ticking for me
so taking all these things together can
be a really really good way to estimate
when you're maybe around three r
right and of course all the lower reps
in reserve two reps in reserve one reps
they will occur a wrap or two or a few
reps past that point
so zero rir is the easy to tell
that's when you're pretty sure that the
next rep won't make it
and that of course also requires
practice because sometimes you can be
positive the next rep won't make it
but you make it and then you try another
one you make that one as well but after
lots of years of training and you know
months and years of experience
you start to know like especially on
things like squats
like when that last rep your quads come
up and they do this thing for a second
and then they finally come up and your
full body lactic acid at this point
you're breathing super heavy
leaky you know that next rep is a real
real gamble
right so that's zero reps in reserve
because it's a little bit different than
failure
failure is actually when you fail the
last drops your reps and reserves when
you know your last rep
is going to be failed and
another good way to tell that you're at
zero rir
is that not only do you feel like you
can't do another rep
but that last rep you did seemed to just
take
everything to do like you your curl was
like
you put your entire soul into that thing
and it barely moved
and ask yourself can i really do another
one of these probably not
right that's zero rar we'll talk about
in a bit how zero
are actually isn't very important to
perceive in most exercises
because you have proper spotters and
proper racks it's okay to go to failure
and you'll find out whether or not your
zero was real or not but the three rir
pretty important to figure out right now
pretty important does not mean all
important and it turns out
that rir gauging doesn't need to be
super precise because folks
really persevered on this issue like
crazy
people will say like i can never tell
3rir versus 4 rir or versus 2 rr
like i have to be able to tell there's a
good reason why you don't
and here's why all you need to do is get
around generally the vicinity of three
reps in reserve
at the beginning of your hypertrophy
mesocycle if that's four reps
you're fine if that's two reps you're
fine and here's why
after you guess three reps in reserve
whatever weight and reps you hit
you're gonna add a little bit of weight
or add a little bit of reps
next time that's it in your next week in
your next session however you periodize
and as you add weight and or reps based
on a plan strategy
what's going to happen is you're either
going to get stronger forever which is
amazing and will never happen
or you will just eventually reach
failure and then you
rinse repeat you deload and then start
that process all over again
so in essence you really only ever need
to guess three rar
like once it's not a weekly thing where
you have to be like all right this
week's target is to where i are and i
gotta guess it exactly
if i don't get it something wrong is
gonna happen because you start at 3rirr
and because you're making things a
little bit harder each time eventually
you will get to zero rar
and you'll look back on your mesocycle
and be like okay trained from roughly
three reps in reserve
all the way to zero that's the
definition of great training whether you
got that
there in four weeks or five weeks or six
weeks is really just not that big of a
deal
it's just not that big of a deal now
the ability to have a decent guess at
3rir at the beginning of a cycle does
pay off
so it does matter right we don't want to
say oh it doesn't matter eventually
you'll get to failure anyway it'll be
good well
if what you thought was three i was
really eight rir you
mesocycle could be eight weeks instead
of five and the first three are just a
total
fucking waste of time because you
trained so easily that you got almost no
gains we definitely don't want that to
happen
and if you think your 3r is really your
zero r your mother cycle might now be
two weeks long instead of five
and that's no bueno because you just
spent a whole lot of time not
accumulating you have to deal a whole
bunch so that's not really good
and not only does it help to know what
your 3r roughly is
it helps to know like are you on track
towards two ir
or one rar so for example let's say it's
your second week of training
and you did three rir ish in your first
week and you want these next reps
uh and weights to be like roughly at two
rar or so
if you do add five pounds of weight to
the bar
and you finish the set like rack match
my reps added five pounds
beta you know that wasn't two rir and it
turns out you're getting stronger faster
and yeah you could extend the length of
your mesocycle and just keep going
but sometimes when you have a
predetermined mesocycle length which a
lot of people do
then you know like okay actually i have
to do more apps or put a little bit more
weight on the bar because that was
clearly not too rrr
and the same thing with one rrr so it's
good to have just a real basic real
world gauge of if you're still at three
or even have dropped
and now at four rir or if you're like
way too aggressive because sometimes you
have three weeks left and it says you're
supposed to do to our ir
whatever planned progression you had
like you added 10 pounds to the bar
and you almost got to failure you're
like gee that's like
zero rir maybe next week i won't add any
weight
and i'll see if the rar goes back to one
or two and thus i'll buy myself an extra
week so you definitely want to have a
real world
just kind of a gut check of what rar
you're at
every time you train but it doesn't have
to be super precise
because of that match or beat system
which we have another video by the way
on that how to use the match or beat
system and
uh that takes care of almost everything
right
so final recommendations you want to do
a good job estimating your 3rr
based on the criteria we mentioned
velocity lactic acid
perception of the weight pushing back at
you and so on and so forth
you begin them as a cycle you add load
and or up slowly but surely
and steadily until you reach failure
several weeks later
now through that time and looking back
during uh
that whole mesocycle you want to note
how your three rer estimates felt like
how they felt as far as how much lactic
acid there was how much the bar slowed
down you want to sort of remember that
you want to note how you felt each week
after that all right
how two-ish rir felt or so you thought
how one-ish rar felt and sorry thought
and you want to note how long you were
able to progress if you were able to
progress
for like six weeks yeah your first week
was probably not three rir was probably
like four or five
if you were able to progress for two
weeks your first week was probably not
three rir unless you somehow got
crazy fatigue out of nowhere and you
want to know what
zero rir felt like and what failure felt
like especially the reps coming up to
failure
at the end of the progression you're
gonna take all that information you're
gonna use it to inform your next
mesocycle
because you remember how 3rir felt and
you know how accurate it was based on
how far you were able to go
in the next meso when you're doing your
first week
you have better information on where to
stop because you're now wiser as to
where 3rr
really is based on your last metacycle
of experience also
you know a little bit better how quickly
or slowly to add load or reps
to target the rar as you want because
essentially you want to go from three
rar
one or two weeks and then two r one or
two weeks in one rir
one or two weeks and zero rir slash
failure
how do you know how much weight erupts
the jump well
experience right the last meso you try
to jump 10 pounds on the leg press and
you end up grinding a failure two weeks
early
next meso you might jump by seven and a
half or by five and all of a sudden you
planned it super super well
so a lot of training wisdom comes from
knowing how many reps or how much weight
you can add on each exercise
in how many rar steps does that equate
to
does adding ten pounds go from three to
2 rar or does adding 10 pounds go from 3
to 0 r because knowing that you know on
dumbbell curls
you're not going to add 10 pounds you
know you don't curl the 40s and curl the
50s next week and be like oh weird i
i didn't even match my reps like i'm
beyond failure like
that's ridiculous because you know you
don't put 10 pounds that's not that
rapid reserve
one represents differences not 10 pounds
for curls but it could be 10 pounds for
deadlifts it could even be 20 for
deadlifts right
so gaining that wisdom is a really big
part so you always pay attention
but you don't overthink the stuff you're
just doing a good job and then after the
mezzo is over you look back and say okay
was i progressing too quickly was i
progressing too slowly
right and here's the thing don't sweat
the details
if you're two ir four ir you can always
make adjustments within the mezzo if one
set was way too easy you can put on
more weight on the next set or just do a
few more reps no big deal
i wouldn't try to go crazy crazy crazy
with okay i gotta hit everything to
where i are today
and if i'm not hitting too hard i gotta
adjust everything if it's challenging
if it's less than three where i are
between three and zero
do your shit match your weight in reps
or go up by a little bit
next workout do a little bit more that
way you'll keep going up and eventually
you'll have awesome success
don't sweat it you'll get better over
time not just get more muscle over time
but you'll get better at estimating
all these rirs and eventually it'll be
super super second nature
folks thank you for tuning in see you
next time i'll practice my last name
more
