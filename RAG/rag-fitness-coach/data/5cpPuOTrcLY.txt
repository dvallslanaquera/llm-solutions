where do you want to grab here's the
actual answer there are tons of right
answers and it all depends on two things
one is stimulus to fatigue ratio okay
some people are built a certain way that
when they grab here they're going to
feel an amazing stimulus to the back and
the fatigue is going to be low some
people they're going to grab here it's
going to be best some people are even
going to grab here and it's going to be
best the other thing is variation you
may be used to grabbing like this for a
few months it gets stale now you grab
out here it gets better
try a bunch of different grip widths
even underhand especially if you have an
easy bar you may find that it's all
winners
