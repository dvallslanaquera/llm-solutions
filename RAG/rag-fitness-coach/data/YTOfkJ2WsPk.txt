oh mama mia it's good to be back dr
james dr mike
it's the weekly webinar we're here to
answer your questions but
first quick housekeeping note guys we're
gonna have a quick format change
on the weekly webinar because of
how the liberal media controlled
algorithms work
god damn it obama no i'm just kidding um
because of uh
partially kidding uh because of how
those work we're gonna actually switch
the weekly webinar to a bi-weekly
webinar
which we're going to record on the first
and third week of every month and
typically that will mean it'll probably
air
the second and fourth week of every
month so just keep that in mind
we ended up putting out so much content
i think so quickly that some of our
videos weren't getting the love and the
attention
that we wanted so we're trying to
ameliorate that for now so we appreciate
your patience in dealing with some of
these changes so
if you are a weekly listener just a
heads up you're gonna we're gonna be
switching to a bi-weekly format so
don't get too upset with us the first
couple weeks as we transition
into this new format so thanks in
advance boom that covers it
let's get to the first yeah let's do it
okey dokey
so first up is henrik anderson
where's hanny let's see top i think top
top
it was for me anyway you there he is oh
yeah
all right upvotes i know man this guy's
a pimp every fucking
every webinar he's top tier that's true
he should just run the q a
um all right he asks he's like no you
guys don't understand i ask the
questions i don't know the answers like
ah right okay
it's a good good webinar caller on the
second week henrik will do the webinar
yeah
henrik asks the questions that's what
the show is called and he just asked
questions and people like that's a good
question and he doesn't answer it
people enjoy his norwegian accent that's
right
um all right he asks how much
hypertrophy are you leaving on the table
if you never go all the way to mrv
how big of a difference is there when
going all the way to mrv compared to
a ending the accumulation phase just
before mrv
b not increasing volume any further than
halfway to mrv
uh stopping at 15 sets when your mrv is
20.
does your answer go for all training
ages or does it vary so james
is it okay if i start on this one yeah
yeah go for it
so a ending the accumulation phase just
before mrv probably cost you almost no
gains maybe very very few gains
and it's certainly probably about even
on the risk to benefit
ratio so it's totally fine as a matter
of fact
much of the time myself jared and
charlie and james
actually will stop just short of mrv
because we kind of know like based on
how this week goes that we're barely
hanging on to performance and next week
will be mrv
but like we're basically just before or
right there and we're not gonna go over
it
so we just stopped so that means maybe
half of our weeks our
wrong guesses and we're stopping just
before mrv we could have done another
week and half of our weeks are correct
guesses
we stopped at mrv so i think that's
totally fine
as long as you aren't accidentally
stopping way early from your mrv just
when things are getting hard and you
could have potentially just kept going
um and then b not increasing volume any
further than halfway to mrv
you know um
can you get good gains like that yes can
you get your best gains
uh maybe not i think especially as you
go
into the very advanced category and
gains become
difficult i think at that point it
starts to pay to push your body to its
limits on occasion
and that means going more than halfway
up to mrv is probably a good idea
um so i would say that for beginners
it's probably fine because everything's
fine for
beginners but for folks that are more
advanced i think that you're
potentially missing out on some real
decent gains there on the other side
of the halfway point and the way it
works with hypertrophy training
is oftentimes like your maximum adaptive
volume will actually occur pretty close
to your maximum recoverable
just fatigue sneaks up on you so quick
so you might actually not even be at
your maximum adaptive volume if you stop
halfway through
i think if you like stop at 17 or 18
sets that might be close to your maximum
adapter for that message cycle
but i don't think 15 is if your true mrv
is 20.
i think with 15 you're just still still
ramping up um can you make up for it by
increasing
like intensity and stuff yeah that comes
with its own trade-offs so i i do think
that it is a cost
probably not much to beginners
intermediates it's probably okay but say
push to mrv every now and again
and for advanced folks i think if you're
really like especially if you're really
interested in maximizing your gains
not going to mrv uh is essentially and
you can hypothesize it like this uh like
you could have done another two weeks of
training where you pushed your squat
another
you know 10 to 20 pounds up for the same
reps but you didn't you just stopped and
started deloading
like man you know that that might be
leaving some gains on the table it
really may be
um and i think there's so just a really
interesting literature review came out
recently that was uh by brad schoenfeld
on failure training
and it really warmed up my innards
because it
reflected something i had predicted
years ago and something james and i have
been hypothesizing for even longer
is that training to failure is just not
really important for most people but for
the very advanced that might have a
little bit more utility
because at that point kind of nothing
really does the trick to get your body
to grow other than pushing it maximally
pretty frequently and it sucks because i
wish there was other ways to push it but
i think that's just it
and that's what the slit review showed
as the potential benefit of going to
failures greater for advanced people
than for beginners
um so i think that same thing probably
applies to volume
where if you never really push your
volume as high as it could go you may
not realize your maximum gains
so i think that that's probably the best
answer i have for that question james
yeah that was really good and take that
reps in reserve guy
hear that oh man he's great some of his
memes are really funny
and some are just like oh my god you
never have sex like
you're clearly like austrian or german
in cell
and you never show your face because
it's not the kind of face you want to
show
you may or may not train with weights
like it's it's a tough life
tough life for me he always stays he
always kind of gets really close to
kind of calling like rp people out but
never quite goes there he always is like
kind of hinting at
i think he's really funny and i think
it's all in good fun i i like that guys
yeah i wonder if it's all in good fun i
i can't tell you know but the stuff
that's funny
i at least think it's in good fun and if
he jabs at us like i don't i don't mind
because
for sure for sure yeah but yeah i think
that was a really good answer i think
kind of the option a
is completely acceptable um and i don't
think you're leaving a lot of gains on
the table
in the uh the book that i'm working on
for sport training in particular
i make the case that for training for
fitness stuff like whether it's strength
power endurance
in a sporting setting you might actually
say it's actually advantageous to never
train to mrv
because of the opportunity cost of going
to mrv and its influence on other things
for example
the amount of gain you might get from
training longitudinally up to your mav
is here
mrv's like maybe right here right but
the amount of effort
to bridge this gap is massive and so you
might make
the fitness fatigue paradigm cost and
say actually bridging that gap for the
various marginal amount of gain that
i'll get from that
is not worth the cost that it's going to
have on my other areas of training such
as
tactics and skill development etc
whereas in
hypertrophy training it's kind of up to
you
there's definitely going to be like a
more systemic fatigue limitation to
training to mrv so that might also
influence your
decision on whether or not to do that if
so if you're somebody who is prone to
calling
your mesocycles as a result of systemic
fatigue limitations
you might not train any of your
individual muscles or at least maybe the
biggest ones
never quite to mrv just so that you
don't have to cut your mesocycles
unnecessarily short
due to systemic fatigue limitations i
think option b
is probably you know i think mike hit it
on the head so like
for beginners you don't really have to
to kind of worry about spanning this gap
so much you just kind of do some really
rudimentary training
once you hit the intermediate stage now
you're considering the mev to mrv window
gap
and stopping halfway along are you
leaving some gains on the table sure
yep mike wants to chime in also as an
intermediate you guys start exploring
what that window really looks like
because you may not even know your mrv
you may think it's 20 but it's really 30
and like you may just be really shitting
yourself so that's that's something i
forgot to say the first time is like
sometimes you got to go to your mrv just
to make sure it's still where it is and
and sometimes you actually you're like
oh wow i could get i can keep going
yeah and keep in mind too like this
applies to mav and mrv as well
but those things are going to shift
longitudinally over time as you gain
fitness
across the board so not only in the
short term like your ability to generate
really big overloads on whatever
movements that you've been training for
week two weeks and that's the case of
mavs so
your mav in week one is going to look
different than your mav you know
12 weeks in because you've been using
the same movement and you've been really
dialed into it
so now you actually have to push a much
higher threshold for stimulus
mrv's the same idea you've got it's
going to keep incrementally shifting up
to a point until you get too advanced
and it might actually get back down
so getting into that idea an
intermediate yes you can you can kind of
do that and you'll make
you make okay gains but maybe not the
best gains it's a trade-off
for advanced i don't really think you
can get away with that because the mev
to mrv uh
window ends up shrinking much more
significantly as you become advanced
right
so you might be like oh i'll just go
halfway well it's like there really
isn't much halfway to go either you're
doing hard training or you're not
so there's you kind of can run into that
um that junk volume space where you
think you're doing hard training but
you're really kind of training at like
med maybe even below mev
uh in that gray zone and between mv and
mev so i would say
if you're an advanced athlete which
again mike and i always make the joke
that
you don't want to be in that position
because it's you're kind of i don't want
to say all or nothing but it's basically
hard training or not and there's not a
lot of great room
gray area in between so you don't have a
lot of room to work with there
was there anything else oh for training
yeah we kind of touched on training
all right earth savior is up next
captain plan hell of a name got it
so earth savior asks hey docs how would
you address an uneven bench press i find
that my left arm locks out
however my right arm is always slightly
bent i can also go a little deeper on
the right side and find that my right
hand
isn't as nicely stacked above my wrists
as a result the left side of my chest
gets a better stimulus
whereas on the right side i always get a
big pump in my triceps and shoulder
which sometimes leads to elbow wrist
issues
i also find that the barbell is wonky
when i squat and wurst at the bottom
i was wondering if you've come across
these sorry
you're dick games no i'm i'm wondering
if he actually has like a significant
limb length discrepancy
sure uh if you ever come across this
interest so how he managed it thanks for
all the awesome content so like
when i squat i point my right foot out
just a little bit more than my left foot
because it feels better that way and i
don't really
question it much more because it just
everything works super well when i do
that
so first is the myth that everything
needs to be completely symmetrical
it doesn't as long as it's getting the
job done and you don't have any joint
connective tissue problems
it's not a problem everyone's
asymmetrical to some extent
if you're really concerned about it and
if it is causing problems i would say
it's a good idea to do some machine
stuff or something like that that this
thing
isn't an issue with and retool your free
weights by starting a little bit lower
and really working on technique
so that failure is what you consider
when things start to turn
different so you really focus on
technique really focus on keeping both
sides pretty pretty similar
and then failure is when they don't and
you stop then
and so it gets you a lot of uh technique
training to become
a little bit more even and i think that
goes
probably a pretty long way it can make
you
you know once you work back up to
heavyweight you're just a much more even
lifter i will say though that it's okay
to make slight adjustments that are
asymmetrical because
uh you know very likely
your muscles insertions or bones
are to some extent asymmetrical and or
the innervation of them is not even
that happens all the time it happens to
everyone and there's kind of no real
making up for that in any foundation way
like if your body ends up being
like one pack is bigger than the other
you can always make up for that and i
have a whole
video on youtube about how to do that uh
bringing up lagging body parts and
another one
on asymmetries and it's just something
you can just google and it comes up
and there's a real process there that's
that's pretty straightforward
but that doesn't mean like once you
bring up your other pec that all of a
sudden your benching is going to fix
itself like it might always be weird
and that's probably a little bit you
know it's probably okay you did say it
gives
you elbow or wrist issues that would be
a reason to sort of rework your
technique
and stop a little bit short of failure
and make sure your technique is always
super spot on
uh but other than that i i honestly like
a lot of folks
who talk about addressing imbalances and
stuff um
it never really seems to work all that
well
because you're dealing with sort of
inherent
inherent asymmetries then there has to
be an imbalance for you to produce
proper movement
to begin with so that's my my thoughts
on that
yeah so i like dr mike said it was
technique should be the primary focus
when you're kind of addressing these
issues and
i think dr mike made a video correct me
if i'm wrong here buddy if uh addressing
muscle asymmetries that you can watch um
so that's on our youtube channel i
believe
i actually think since you're having
since it's not just a bench press issue
it seems like you're having kind of
transient issues with this asymmetry
i would be very curious to see if you
actually have a significant limb length
discrepancy on that side
so that would be something you could
actually measure um if you are somewhat
familiar with kind of
bony uh landmarks on the body or if you
just have somebody who's like an
exercise science person and wouldn't
mind helping you out doing that
measurement
um i would be very curious because it
seems like you're having issues uh
in other movements besides the bench
press so that might be an instance where
you have like a clinical
imbalance which normally mike and i are
pretty quick to dismiss
but this is one where okay it's
manifesting and not only upper body
movements but also in like your
positioning on lower body movements and
you're having
kind of injuries uh that are occurring
as a result so to me that that would
kind of point towards yeah you might
actually have a clinical imbalance maybe
get that checked out
and then go from there unfortunately if
you do a lot of the processes in
addressing it are still kind of the same
issue where it's you adjust your
technique accordingly you adjust your
movements accordingly to minimize pain
to maximize mind muscle connection on
the other side etc
so unfortunately even if it is like a
bony problem
um you still have to work around it
largely the same way
but you might be able to get some help
from like a pt or somebody like uh like
quinn hannock
if it is like a clinical imbalance and
they might have greater insights as to
how to work around that than
dr microwave
there you go it's tough man because it
it almost requires you
to at some level accept that perfection
may not be possible
which fucking blows yeah and it's again
you can't what it's not like you can
shave an
uh an inch off your arm you know so it's
like what are you going to do you know
all right
just want to note 46 upvotes on this one
my god
what a question he says a question about
some pains and aches due to training
first i'm fully aware
i'm another seeking to receiving medical
advice just asking for some shared
perspectives and personal experience
with that other way i'm experiencing my
best self diagnosis medical uh medial
epicondylitis
right on the inner side of the elbow on
both arms i think these
months of home training barbells and
dumbbell work only try to be too much
for my bitch-ass elbows even with versa
grips
i cannot uh tell what is hurting me as
nothing hurts while training so i have
not been able to experiment with changes
of exercise or altering technique
could be jerking off but i doubt it i'm
nowhere near my mrv there
so here are the options i'm exploring
please let me know what you think about
them
if i may be missing something or you had
success with some situations
uh option a is active rest option b is
maintenance training but for what it
would make sense to be pulling
causing the issue but i read people get
this from all sorts of pulling pushing
and flies
see fortunately the germs are reopening
in my region i could do exclusively
light machine work
which would fit nicely with my plan a
template nozzle that's just coming
i'm also waiting on my 157 and td 500
which i will try
thoughts on them i also have access to
free prp treatments
what the fuck who the fuck do you know
man that's amazing yeah
give it a shot thank you so much in
advance so i would say
that you should take active rest and you
should go to the gym after
and start to ease into hypertrophy work
and reintroduce
movements that have nothing to do with
your elbows first or minimum elbow
theoretical elbow pain induction
and see how it goes uh and you may find
that you have no elbow pain whatsoever
and then you slowly reintroduce
movements every couple weeks
that may hurt your elbows and you do
very low volumes and you see oh okay so
i started doing skull crushers again
with dumbbells
and then the elbow pain came back so i
think that's what's really doing him
introducing one or two movements at a
time can really let you figure this out
um so so that's that's the thing there
when i was training exclusively at home
during
the lockdown uh i ran into an adductor
strain like kind of a chronic strain
that i just
like recovered from probably pretty
completely just a few weeks ago
and i had done i had finished training
at home
months ago that's how long this shit
took to recover because i was doing so
many
posterior chain bent over position
things because every we were
rowing three times a week and it's all
bent over rose because there's no
fucking machines
and that caused my adductor strain just
to sort of compound on itself
and it really fucking blew so i i
totally hear you on the fact that
people like people who say like man you
only need fucking barbells and dumbbells
you know
machines like they just don't train hard
enough they're like they're like kind of
people who post like
they do like what's that shit called
james when they like street street shit
or like they do planks and shit like
that
oh remember there was like that came up
a week or two ago where somebody was
like do you know about like
power street power lifting and we were
like what right
so basically like shit like that people
say
they're all recreationally training if
you're training a bit more intently then
machines are fucking awesome so um
so that would be my best advice to you
um if
you run into a situation where that act
of rest
doesn't heal your elbow issues and or
when you start training at all they come
back
then uh then i could look into
going to a doctor to get some diagnosis
going that's probably the best
option you don't want to start prp
treatments because you don't know if
it's tenderness
you don't know what it is in general if
you take
bpc157 during active rest in the
beginning of your
recovery you will probably have very
good healing bbc 157 is miraculous
i don't have any personal experience
with tb500 but if it's anything like
bbc157
it's the fucking it's the miracle cure
so they're great these all sound like
droids on star wars
literally they are droids and they just
they open up your
your elbows and do surgery but yeah
other peptides are fractions of the
growth hormone total peptide
like growth hormone does like a trillion
things and one of the small fractions is
the tissue healing part
bbc157 is the tissue healing component
just by itself
um i've used it before it's fucking
awesome uh
so have fun again prp's cool but it's a
bit involved
and uh i would try some more minor shit
before i went and got prp and also the
question is
you know almost in every case before
going to prp
you'd like to have a diagnosis from a
medical doctor before you just go in and
start
shit shitting yourself um shooting
biologics specifically
james yeah really good advice jordan
this is my life i saw this question and
i was like oh my god
this is me this is literally me so i
have this exact problem where uh because
i
work out at home and i'm limited to
until recently mostly barbells and
dumbbells
i am constantly in and out of what i
also have self-diagnosed as medial
epicondylitis and for me i can feel it
right
right on that fucking epicondyle it just
kills me
and so um i've done a pretty good job
managing it but
as you said if you work out with primary
barbells and dumbbells
these are the types of trade-offs that
you make right you're going to have
more wear and tear type injuries just as
a result of the
the modalities that you're using so a
couple things that you can do
right mike already outlined a really
bunch of really good strategies and
active rest is pretty much always
whenever there's injuries or stuff going
on always a good place to start
for me it was narrowing down the
exercises that i could tell were
exacerbating it so
as you said sometimes they don't cause
pain while you're doing it it only
manifests like later on when you're in
like the second mezzo of a block and
you're like god my elbows are acting up
what's doing it
and so it's hard to kind of nail it down
so it is a very slow
and tedious process of guess and checks
so that's kind of the unfortunate news
in some of this regard is
because it takes a long time to figure
it out you have to kind of start
with a pretty clean slate and then make
very minor adjustments to exercises
over time so i have figured out for me
that jm
presses although seem to cause immense
growth in my triceps like when i do when
i have
blocks of jm presses my arms get
noticeably bigger they also
get blown up in that epi medial
epicondylitis guaranteed
if i do them i know that i'm going to
have problems parallel grip pull-ups and
pull-downs
same thing some variations on hammer
curls close
grip curls same thing so for me there's
like a handful of exercises which is
taking me like
years to figure out that's the end
that's kind of the downside it's taking
me like a couple years to figure out
those are just a no-no and if i throw
and i figured out if i put them into the
mix
within a few months it's going to flare
up now it might be it's going to be
different for you like it might not be
the same movements so don't copy me and
say well james said don't do parallel
pull downs no it's just
we're built different ways that's just
one that's not not good for me you got
to figure it out for you
number two you can start using more
isolation movements so
if you're doing like you know for me it
was like a lot of presses
and a lot of like pull-up or assisted
pull-up variations
and so what you might find you have to
do is stop doing quite as many compounds
and maybe
introduce some more isolation movements
one of the things that i got was the
cable stack attachment to my um
squat rack which really opened up a lot
of options for me
in terms of like i can do like cable
lats i can do
some different arm stuff right just more
options there
so instead of doing like okay i'm doing
this bench press on this day this bench
press on this day and this dumbbell
press on another date maybe think about
doing some flies
or you know anything along those lines
as mike said like if there's anything
where you just feel like direct tension
in your elbow even if it's not pain like
again for me skulk
this the jm presses like i feel it
which is good right you're like oh yeah
this is working really hard but i also
feel it like up in that forearm and
elbow area
indicating it's probably not great uh
one thing that i have used and i hate
going here and i'm
like i'm cringing and i know mike's
gonna cringe too
oh i hate to go here but it does help uh
the compression sleeves
is something that i have worn with great
success when it does flare up so the
problem with compression sleeve is
it's a it's a band-aid it'll help kind
of get you through when
it's already flared up um it's not going
to help prevent that flare-up because
whatever it is that you're doing in
training is causing it and that the
compression sleeves want to dick about
that
but if you get the like actual heavy
duty not the like you know
spats ones i mean i'm talking about the
real heavy pressure ones that are hard
to pull on
um those will kind of help and the nice
thing about those is you can
you know train wait a couple hours and
then put them on for the rest of the day
even while you sleep
and it does kind of have like a very
slow trickling effect of ameliorating
some of that
uh inflammation so those are things that
i think are good
unfortunately there's no quick fix even
taking active rest
might make them feel better temporarily
but if you're still doing movements that
are
causing the problem they'll just flare
back up again so
it's a slow it's probably being
redundant at this point but it's a slow
process
try and be as methodical and scientific
as you can don't just clump and say like
okay we've got all these different
movements i'm taking them all away
try and do them like one or two
movements at a time and figure out which
you know push or pull movements are
really bothering you
perfect next up
is philippe gramatakovsky holy philippe
got it here's a very simple question
that is a very simple answer
is there a compounding effect on rest
and recovery would resting two days in a
row during week versus two days
with training in between your recovery
recover or start in between
recover you more the same or less i
understand recovery starts as soon as
you walk away from your last set and atp
cp refilling is way faster than protein
synthesis that occurs later how linear
is the recovery after that
so the thing is is i have um
good reason to believe we'll see what
james says about this that there is
actually a small compounding effect but
taking two days in a row
recovers you to a qualitative depth that
is greater than if you just take
two days off during the week but it's
only one day off at a time
i don't take two days off at a time
because i train so much i can't afford
to do that
but if i was training five days a week
you better believe i would take two
consecutive days off
and uh i used to train like that and the
recovery you get from two days off
is really really really legit versus
kind of spreading the recovery around
and not getting as much quality recovery
if you do it a little bit more often now
mind you the biggest variable there is
how many days off a week do you take
the more you take the more you recover
but there is absolutely something to say
for that that nuance there that two days
in a row i think does offer you a little
bit of extra quality james
yeah i i that was a really good answer
from dr mike so within that so as mike
said
the primary variable there is how many
days off do you take but then kind of a
secondary variable is
can you actually take them two days in a
row or do you have other things that you
have to do so a lot of people their
schedule
is such that they have to take two spurs
interspersed
days off at different points right and
so it's one of those things where yes it
might be better to take them
two days back to back but if your
schedule doesn't allow for it and you're
trying to cram it into a routine and
it's not working
there's a trade-off to be made there too
in terms of practicality which you know
might kind of be a net zero at that
point
i will say although i agree with dr mike
that there is a compounding effect
i'm thinking this is more of a
curvilinear kind of effect rather than
like an exponential effect it's not like
you're gonna take the next day and then
all of a sudden like all everything is
healed
it's like okay it was kind of linear and
now it's like sloping up a little bit
more
as a result of taking two in a row
rather than like an exponential
you know rocket ship level of recovery
so
if it works for you great uh for some
people it doesn't work and
i don't think that you're really missing
out on a ton if you have to take um kind
of
throughout the week independent of each
other if it just works that in your
schedule
better then that's probably good in the
long term anyway
yeah all right
flu f-l-o-o no flu
says hey ducks do you have any
post-surgery tips
in a few days i have an ankle surgery
and can't walk around for six weeks
obviously i won't be able to train lower
body
but how about my upper body does it
hinder my recovery of my ankle when i'm
getting sore in the upper body
how do i manage to not lose muscle and
don't get fat since i won't be able to
move lol and train hard thanks a lot so
first thing you got to do is ask your
surgeon when you're okay to return to
um hard physical activity that does not
involve your ankle you're going to be
very specific
that you ask him that specifically hard
physicist if you just say hard physical
activity he's going to say
you mean like running around you fucking
idiot six weeks right
or more i might be like no not for a
year right like yeah for a year or some
shit but you gotta say like look
can i lift weights for my upper body i
won't touch my ankle at all how does
that work
he might because yeah there are systemic
effects he might want you to take two
to six weeks off completely of
everything so so for example here's a
mechanism
sometimes uh when you have various
surgeries you have various components
pins or whatever things that are stuck
together uh transient high increases in
blood pressure real bad because they
actually push it uh aside blood pressure
transfers to body pressure essentially
you end up kind of tearing the wound
open if you've got a lot of pressure on
it
even if it's not directly using a limb
so uh
that may be a real bad thing so you
gotta ask your doctor but so when he
says
then yeah you very slowly ease into
upper body training that doesn't touch
your ankle
whatever he says you're allowed to and
then you won't lose any upper body mass
matter of fact you'll probably gain a
shit load
and then as far as legs you can ask him
like hey like
after six weeks when you can start
walking around you say hey can i do some
resistance training for the lower body
that doesn't involve my ankle
and it'll probably say yeah and then you
can do like leg extensions and leg curls
until you're blue in the face
uh and conserve and probably build a
little bit of
mass and then slowly as you're cleared
for more and more activity you can get
back into training
with your doctors with your surgeons uh
supervision at all times
for what you're doing or not supervision
his signing off has to occur
has to occur because you can really fuck
yourself in the ass by getting in too
early
uh translate the increasing blood
pressure popping open some
of the stitching he's done and then all
of a sudden you got to get the surgery
all over again or it gets infected or
some other crazy kind of shit or heals
wrong fuck
you don't want to do any of that shit
yeah excellent answer so with the
caveats dr mike already said about
recovery timelines and doctor approval
and etc sometimes it's actually good to
once you are cleared
for exercise to train the contralateral
leg right so that you're not losing
muscle on that side
and that actual stimulation can have
that cross-talking effect that can help
you
maintain some of the muscle on your
ipsilateral surgery side
another thing that you can do which i
know you bear with me it sounds
hippy-dippy but
i've researched it it seems to be true
is that you can do
um mental practice for the muscles on
the surgery side of the leg which is
like um
i know this sounds lame but just bear
with me it's basically thinking about
training that muscle or moving that
limb in such a way that you would in a
training activity
and trying to really internalize and
mindfully think about
the proprioception of doing a particular
exercise or an activity so in the
example of let's say you were
you can't move your right leg but you
want to try and think about uh
preserving the muscle in your right leg
training the left leg is probably not a
bad idea because there's nervous system
crosstalk
and on the right leg you can actually
just do what we call mindsets which
would be like
think about what it would feel like to
do a set of 10 on a leg press or knee
extension or a hamstring curl on that
leg
and not just superficially like okay do
this like
something like this if you actually
think about your experience of what that
is
to go through that range of motion to
feel the tension to feel the my muscle
connection to feel the proprioception of
doing that movement
there is some evidence to suggest that
that mental practice can help prevent
deconditioning to some small degree
so i know that might sound kind of
hippie for some people but it's there
and if you're worried about losing
muscle
you can do it and tell you what i wish i
would have done that shit because when i
had my knee surgery i did everything
wrong
period and i would if i could go back i
would have done my pt
i would have listened to the doctor i
would have done the hippie shit like the
mental training
and i wouldn't have had a buff leg and a
skinny leg for so long it looks stupid
i uh i got you one for you james i had
umbilical hernia surgery repair i think
2008
and i pulled off
my uh medical tape that was functioning
as a stitch
because it said like in 24 hours pull
off all the dressings from the wound
i'm not a fucking doctor that looked
like dressing to me
so i was like all right i pulled off the
dressing and i was like there's a piece
of tape i gotta know they tape shit
together
i pull off the tape blood just starts
coming out i was like nah all right
i called the surgeon i was like hey like
i pulled off the tape and blood's coming
out and he like got mad he's like
what he's like why the fuck would you do
that and i was like hey check this out
man
i'm not a fucking doctor and you know
for me they assume that tape is part of
a wound dressing is not entirely outside
of its you know fucking linguistic
contextual category first of all or
second of all
and third of all i never saw you after
my surgery motherfucker
i saw a nurse and then i was sent home
you never told me shit you gave me this
fucking they gave me a fucking type out
sheet i read it i interpreted it
as i did and he's like all right i write
it right just don't muck with it anymore
i'm like all right he thanks for nothing
you fucking dick
and uh yeah fuck that guy
some piece of shit some surgeons are
real assholes
and granted like being an asshole is
probably what makes them good at being a
surgeon
but it doesn't change the fact that they
have like shitty bedside manner yeah go
hire someone with good bedside manner to
tell me shit instead of being like how
are you feeling i'm like good they're
like all right you can just leave i'm
like sweet
i had a similar thing with mine where uh
when i went in and they like yep
they diagnosed me with the acl tear he
was like oh that's what you get for
doing something like playing rugby now
you'll never do anything athletic again
i was like
fuck you on so many levels guy like what
are you talking about i'm about to do my
last athletic thing and double like the
fuck out of you
yeah you know went on to do plenty more
athletic things
yeah you went on to play rugby again
right yeah not to mention like had
plenty of lifting prs picked up new
sports and hobbies like
fuck out of here yeah it's nuts not for
nothing kickboxing
yeah for real pretty knee intensive yeah
you would think
all right next up is alejandro
mayofret got it he's for sure
running drugs but high level highlighter
that's the thing about like like if
you're a drug dealer the more hispanic
and like colonial your name is the
higher up in the food chain you are
like if your drug dealer's name is
skeeter like he's not high
up in the food chain he cooks his own
meth maybe
where he sells other people's meth but
alejandro you don't fuck with alejandro
you will get but he will disappear
mayo fret's an interesting last name too
right it's like not so hispanic so you
think he's like
super exotic like he's the guy that like
makes people
disappear he's the hispanic guy that you
go to see on the plantation and he's got
blue eyes and you're like he's gonna
fucking kill me this is it he's the guy
in the movies you don't fuck with
that's all i'm saying totally totally
with you on that
yeah all right and he always has a story
to tell
like before he fucks you up he's like my
ancestors came to colombia
with nothing from austria and you're
like see
that's the mayo friend that's fucking
austrian i knew it and then he goes on
to like
we had to do everything the hard way and
i'm not going to have my wealth taken
from me and you're like look alejandro
i know i'm just i'm just dropping off
your ubereats
he just ordered like a sob or something
like having a meltdown
he's like sorry i thought you were
someone else you're like can i leave
he's like he tips you really well all
right
but then you realize like he ordered
mayo but you put mustard and you're like
run to your car as fast as possible
drive away from no no no no no
leave your family behind anyway all
right alejandro thanks for your name
hi docs i have a question regarding
specialization phase and i perturb you
when choosing movements for the muscles
in
maintenance volume should we bias
towards exercise with low fatigue for
example
if chest is on the back burner should we
avoid barbell compounds to lower even
more the overall fatigue and maybe a
couple more sets for the prioritized
muscles
or is it insignificant those things
don't matter as much uh thank you for
the information you give us free you are
the best well it's our pleasure
those things do matter but what you
really are looking at is stimulus to
fatigue ratio not just fatigue
because if the stimulus is pretty high
and fatigue is pretty low you only have
to do like two sets and you get all your
muscle
uh completely uh no loss and also you
get a very low fatigue on the other hand
if something is like a unbelievable raw
stimulus magnitude
uh like it really grows a fuck load of
muscle but it also comes with pretty
high fatigue
yeah like you may have to do very little
work but that fatigue might still be
like ah maybe i don't want to do it
more specific answer is some movements
like when you go to mv
a lot of times it's to sort of
reinvigorate those movements or those
muscles like for later you want to
potentiate them for later gains
you sure as hell don't want to beat up
your joints during that time so like
if your idea of maintenance volume is
doing like low bar squats and overhead
standing barbell presses yeah they have
great signals to fatigue ratios
but the rusty mist magnet is so high and
the fatigue is pretty high
the ratio is still really good but you
just don't need that raw stimulus magnet
because you just want to keep the
fatigue lower
specifically to joints connective
tissues you want to come back to low bar
squats
four weeks later and feel good instead
of being like i squatted heavy this
whole time and yeah i kept my muscles
but my back's fucked up and now i need
to take time away
so yeah like for beginners intermediates
just high sfr exercises should always be
your choice
for advanced people when they go to
maintenance volume they actually can't
choose the overall
very low fatiguing exercises um to
really kind of step away from that
especially if it's
like not just specialization but if it's
like a low volume re-sensitization phase
like maybe it's just all machines and
cables to really give your joints a
break and then you get into the freeway
movements later
james what do you think yeah yeah i
totally agree and uh like if the chest
is using the chest example like you
might just get away with doing like two
sets of like a dumbbell pec fly or
something like that and that's all you
need
whereas like you might also get a really
good stimulus from doing something like
a wide grip bench press
but it comes with so much more baggage
from the increased load
and the multiple joints and muscles
involved you might get more systemic
spillover from that particular movement
which could then hinder your training in
other ways
so in that case like having the machines
or other movements which sometimes
just a little bit lower on the fatigue
side again like like a chest like a pec
deck fly or dumbbell fly versus like a
bench press
might be advantageous because it just
frees up resources for whatever
other thing that you're specializing in
especially what you don't want
and this is something that might sound
like duh of course not but i think
people make this mistake
is you don't want to pick a movement
that is for a muscle that's on mv
which is going to have systemic
spillover to the ones that you're trying
to specialize i think that's where you
really want to minimize as much as
possible now sometimes you can't
but you want to try and minimize any of
that systemic or just muscle spill over
to the movements that you're trying to
pre uh muscles that you're trying to
prioritize that would be like a
big no-no yeah yeah good stuff
all right
which means i pity you it's like vasil
who pities you
he's like he's like russian mr t
basically 100
so hey docs thank you for always being
at the community service
i would like to know a little bit about
exercise sequencing within a session
and the different outcomes that all the
uh choices yield
i don't think it's a very discussed
topic in the community what's the
difference between
starting with a machine or dumbbells for
let's say a push day and then going over
to something that's a compound movement
is that considered pre-exhausting what
am i missing uh out on if i choose to go
with barbell compound versus dumbbell or
machine compound first
also how did the rep really just change
between these two choices ps which i
changed my picture to
i don't want to steal our piece thunder
like that neither do i want to offend
mike by using his pick from the past
uh so if i seal first of all you're not
stealing your thunder man it's all
fucking jokes oh banta in it
like the british say so you can fucking
you can use anything you want you can
use picture
me currently past rp you could have a
fuck rp logo we don't give a fly fuck
dude
you're the man you do you we're just
happy to have you along for the ride uh
but i'm the note of the question so it's
a very interesting answer to this
the first thing you're all you're
concerned with is uh priority
what muscles do i want to make the
biggest in this program they should be
first
thus the exercises should address the
muscles first do you probably figure
that right so you're talking about push
day
you know if chest is number one priority
you got to go with something that really
really taxes the chest so like for
example if you say okay wide grip bench
really taxes my chest
but like medium grip dumbbell press like
taxes my chest and triceps roughly
evenly
if you're really serious about training
your chest then automatically that will
put
a wide grip bench first okay so that's
first consideration second consideration
stimulus to fatigue ratio you want your
highest sfr exercises first
because the first exercise is the ones
that give you the best yield
and then you want your best exercises
first because you so
essentially just amplify them the best
you know like if you have two appliances
in your kitchen or only one plug
you're gonna plug in the appliance that
like works better slash use more you
know
you know you use your microwave three
times a day use a toaster once a week
you don't plug in the toaster you plug
in your fucking microwave and then you
can unplug every now and again so
same idea there highest sfr exercises go
first so if you're looking at barbell
compound versus dumbbell or machine
like you asked like which one of those
three has uh your best sfr and you're
like well like
it's the dumbbell press well then that's
the fucking answer right and
so that's in the third part of the
answer is
uh which one of those have the best sfrs
and concordance with the rep range
you're targeting
generally speaking you could do a
variety of rep ranges within a week but
with any one session you should probably
unless it's the same rep range each time
through the whole session for each
exercise that's fine mostly you start
heavier and go lighter after in other
words
you don't start lighter and go heavier
that that's almost never what you do
so like you do for example if we're
going to use an example of all three rep
ranges
your first exercise will be in the five
to ten your second one might be five to
ten or ten to twenty
and your third and fourth might be ten
to twenty or twenty or thirty right you
could
it would almost never be the other way
around unless you're super advanced
you've got some weird shit going on so
we're pretty exhausting your managing
injuries
axial fatigue all this other crazy shit
so basically
if we look at your example let's say you
chose a dumbbell because it's great sfr
but you also know that you grow your
chest really well with sets of five to
ten and you know dumbbells are just
untenable for five to ten because it's
mostly instability and you waste half
your energy trying to get them up to
your fucking
shoulders so actually i'm gonna do
barbell wide grip because i really want
chest
it sets a five to ten works perfect and
then after i'm gonna do dumbbell because
it's the highest sfr
but i'm gonna do it in sets of like you
know 10 to 20 where it's really awesome
and then i move on to whatever that
isn't chest training so that's basically
how you would
um figure that out with those three
categories um
and that yields a lot of stuff now
there's more advanced considerations pre
pre-exhaust using different rep ranges
in in sort of
uh you know higher reps first but that's
all stuff for like really exotic people
that um are just uh really dealing with
a lot of axial fatigue and systemic
fatigue caps
you probably almost certainly aren't so
those three are a real good place to
start james
yeah great answer and so i think uh
where the confusion on this
lies like why why why it might be
considered like taboo to do
a machine or a comp or an isolation
before like a compound barbell lift i
think is kind of um
conflating the like traditional strength
conditioning world with hypertrophy
training stuff
so in strength conditioning you
typically are going to choose
the um the movements that have the best
transfer of training effects for that
session for whatever it is
um and those are typically going to be
your kind of compound barbell movements
so in a typical strength conditioning
setting
you're going to see usually like your
weightlifting variants and like your
barbell squats and presses kind of
pretty early on in a session
so that the athlete is the most prepared
for those particular movements and can
exert the most power or
force um and other things like your kind
of more hypertrophy based things or more
kind of work capacity things
don't get interfered with as much at the
back end of the session whereas if you
did in the reverse order
you wouldn't be able to exert as much
strength or power if you did this other
thing first so in that sense
it matters and so i think a lot of
people carry that notion of like oh i
gotta do my squats before i do anything
else
first just because they came from an
athletic background and that does take
to make the most sense in that setting
but when you do hypertrophy training
we can really just wipe that whole
notion clean and just look at
the sfrs of the movement which is what
dr mike was already talking about
so i think that's where the confusion
like there's nothing there's no you're
not missing out on anything if you say
i'm gonna do
an isolation movement first and then a
compound movement second as long as
the sfrs if those movements are in the
correct hierarchy right
whereas like if you are training to
become like a really baller rugby player
and you're like i'm going to do some
knee extensions and then some like you
know power cleans later
that would be a clear violation of
exercise order in that case
but for appropriate training you don't
have to worry about that
all right um i threw in an extra
question james because we had
kind of a couple really good questions i
wanted to hit sure
next up is kyle houser
got it not to be confused with
doogie hauser which is also like
so um who is over i think doug and i
watched the first episode of doogie
howser cause like hulu has all these
fucking weird old shows
you know like first of all it's wildly
anachronistic but second of all
what the fuck kind of a name is doogie
that sounds like an insult
it's like his dad calls him doogie it's
like dangerously close to duke
dookie like you motherfucker you named
after a piece of shit
yeah also and he's also like rude to
other doctors and stuff because he's
like 12 and a doctor
dude if i was a fucking doctor on that
floor and he fucking buffed off to me
i'd take him in the back and be like
fuck who you are i'll fucking ghost you
right in this room
motherfucker you know what i'm saying
kind of like a predator style
when uh bill cook told the guy like
whatever
uh bill duke the actor the super dark
tim black guy pulled
carl weathers aside and he was like you
give up a position once again
i'll bleed you real quiet leave you here
i was like fuck yeah
yeah he's uh that guy was kind of like
greta thornberg
with an education right yeah like
yeah but ostensibly he knew things that
actually like were real instead of like
he's gonna kill us all tomorrow whatever
there's a fucking sweet picture of like
an eight-year-old smoking or something
like that
and like it was somebody named it and it
was like greta fenberg says guys stop
sharing this picture it's not me
it really looks like her just like
smoking and singing
ouch also kyle houser is kyle dot hauser
which makes it yeah
some kind of executable file maybe he's
an ai
oh dude recently people have been doing
like this one guy on instagram is like
something
kyle. like wave file or whatever because
he's like a music producer
and other guys like abashek.jpg and just
like you're not fooling anyone like you
just just put in dot incel
and it tells us everything we need to
know james dot
porn watcher wow that really describes
you like yes i know
i'm glad we're clear connoisseur is more
accurate yeah yeah
totally um do you remember marcos knows
like all the porn stars names in their
video series and stuff like that's real
dedication
you know like that's a handy seal
because like sometimes you'll be
thinking about a particular porn star
but you can't remember their name and
you're like damn it
describe it like every ever like once a
week when i fucking jack off that's
exactly what i end up doing i'd be like
god damn it what's that idiot's name
it's tough it's hard life's hard
sometimes
life's hard yeah these are that's the
most west like first world problem
so you're like this is super fucked up
you're like a children's hospital a kid
like has no legs he's like it's tough
for like i hear you man listen let me
tell you about i was trying to find porn
right
i can't fucking remember this bitch's
name he's like yeah that really doesn't
relate
i tried then i finished and then the
next video that popped up was her ah
i just had wasted market bookmark but
it's not the same
yeah um kyle houser finally
asks new parents here about to start a
child on solid food
congratulations on acquiring a child
where is this one going oh no
it's luckily nowhere crazy he's like i
wanted to start him on bulgarian food
can my baby mini cut are they so sweet
when is the time for the first mini cut
yeah do you guys know of any
evidence-based practices that are known
to help a child develop a healthy
long-term relationship with food
there is no shortage of unreliable
information that's true
regarding feeding children on the
internet and family and friends are very
quick to share their wisdom yes
often unrequested um i'm looking for
something more scientific my wife and i
our rp veterans
feel very confident with the foundations
of healthy eating of course we see a
pediatrician regular
i'm not looking to substitute for her
care uh just looking for broad long-term
scientific strategies raising kid
that's less likely to have poor eating
habits if this is not in your wheelhouse
there's someone you can direct me to an
rp thanks doc so i got a couple of
pieces of insight for you so first of
all as you said
nothing replaced your pediatrician's
advice never ever violate
her advice unless you think her shit is
real wonky then go get a second opinion
from
another pediatrician or a dietitian that
is licensed to work with very young
children
um because sometimes pediatricians get
them like i i wish the industry was a
little bit better
it's really good but every now and again
you get a pediatrician that's like no
dairy because it's evil you're like what
the fuck are you talking like i've
literally like
had friends be like my pediatrician says
don't know gary for the kid after age
two and it's like
what the fuck i think it's just nonsense
right as a matter of fact probably
really bad nonsense so
uh she'll almost certainly be right
about everything but to the extent that
you think she's really really off go see
another medical doctor about it
um so that that is as it is uh second
piece of insight and this is something
i've actually
looked into considerably uh they've
looked at uh
relationships long-term relationships
with food and it turns out that they're
from twin adoption studies there's
almost no detectable effect of the
common home environment on
someone's long-term relationship of food
so what that means is like if you adopt
a kid
who genetically like his ancestors had
really shitty food relationships like
they just like junk food all the time
you adopt a kid when they're in your
home
you can feed them really well because
you just don't give them any
alternatives as soon as they turn like
30 you know 12 13 14 and they start
going to school and getting food
everywhere they essentially revert back
almost completely to whatever the fuck
is their genetics we're gonna point them
to
um and some kids age into their genetics
so for example
some some kids will have parents like
genetic parents that are really just
awesome eaters you guys know like some
people just eat healthy all the time
it's just what they like like my dad is
one of these people he just eats like
fruits and veggies all the time
um sometimes kids age into that stuff so
when they're like
13 and 14 or 15 or even younger they'll
just eat like only cheese pizza and
nuggets sometimes mixed together and the
parents are like what the fuck are we
doing wrong
then they turn 18 19 20 et cetera and
they start to clean up their diet not
because anyone ever told them to like
because it just doesn't taste as good
anymore and they like eating clean like
i remember a distinct time
when i was massing for powerlifting back
in my natty days when i was like 20 and
i went to get mcdonald's and i ate it
and halfway through i was like i'm
probably never going to have mcdonald's
for another year after this and i didn't
because it just felt so awful
and i just naturally like i hated when
my dad preached to me about oh make sure
you should have a food
shut the fuck up get out of my life dad
get out of my room
so uh like i never listened to a fucking
thing he said but now i'm an adult and i
eat mostly healthy because it feels good
turns out it has the fucking the same
genetics as him and my mom
or very similar right and that's how it
ended up being so
that is to tell you kyle that despite
all of your best efforts this could
amount to
absolutely dick however if your kid's
related to you and you like healthy food
there's a chance that they
are going to get on that bandwagon what
you can absolutely do
is give them really really awesome leg
up on just long-term health
by feeding them healthily in the home
when you do control most of their food
choices like and when they go off on
their own and they go to college who
knows they might just like start
snorting egg rolls or some shit like
that
but like i'm a real bad place in my diet
i don't even eat my food anymore like
holy shit
we've all been oh right for sure oh yeah
colleges i was on i was on that ramen
program for
quite a while 100 so
um what you can do so so just some basic
outlines
we do have a book at rp that starts for
for children children
more later children and teens uh we do
have a book by paul salter and it has
some really really great
insight if you want to buy that
eventually for the kid you can take a
lot out for younger children but
here are the sort of the foundational
basics first of all there are no food
groups that are off limits
none so forget about that shit okay
second of all put healthy shit in front
of them that is also very nutritious
do not feed them low fat diets don't
fucking do it okay
so you should probably have like two
percent or whole milk in the house
and whenever you present food to your
kid most of it not all of it should be
really healthy
fruits veggies some meats they don't
have to be super lean
minimum processed food is fucking
awesome now there may be a situation
where sometimes kids don't eat
uh everything on their plate try to get
them to a little bit like hey you should
eat your vegetables and if they really
don't want to it's not a big deal
in almost every case if they have access
to it if kids ever
get vitamin mineral deficiencies they
self-resolve them by starting to crave
things
that uh address those so you never have
to stuff your kid full of shit they
don't want to eat
what you can do is if the kid isn't
eating enough for dinner blah blah blah
and maybe their timing is off and you're
thinking oh fuck like i'm starving my
kid because he never wants to eat
anything and i only offer this and that
first of all
it's almost never gonna happen because
when the kid gets hungry he's gonna eat
whatever fucks in front of him
like if you you get like children that
are really in food insecure areas and
you feed them anything they fucking eat
it immediately they look up to you for
more
not that your kid wants to get there but
a really good snack to have around for
kids is
two percent or whole milk and they can
have access to it at some time
at any time they want so uh it's been
shown that even
uh as a matter of fact especially high
fat dairy wildly healthy first of all
second of all
it supports growth and development like
crazy uh full fat dairy is some straight
up it's a kid growing
like a kid growing serum literally it's
literally what it's designed to do
um so it's fucking awesome so if the kid
doesn't eat a lot of dinner he should
have the option of just
drinking a bunch of milk or some shit
before he goes to sleep and that's
totally cool
and then just be real gentle and ginger
about some shit don't make any crazy ass
rules
but when they're in your house they
really only have mostly healthy choices
and that means they can have some chips
and ice cream every now and again and
it's not crazy shit off limits but if
you and your wife are eating well
breakfast lunch and dinner and snacks
a prank fundamentally pretty fucking
healthy and a little bullshit here and
there
that's really like a great thing to make
sure your kid develops properly
and also uh you know again to my first
point or second point you don't have a
lot of saying developing their adult
eating strategies
you might as well feel feed them good in
the home one thing that can take kids a
little bit
even if they have the genetics to eat
healthy uh if they
remember healthy eating as this awful
terrible thing that was foisted on them
against their will
they may resist it longer so if it's
healthy eating it's just something that
you do and it's not like
sort of like dogmatized or there's not a
lot of religiosity you almost finished
your vegetables you're evil
and cake is bad and veggies are good
there's kind of a bunch of bullshit
develops around that that just doesn't
have to happen
so just present them with foods and if
they don't like them they can have the
fucking
whole milk if they get hungry and that's
about how that works
so james um anything to add there no
great answer
so this is completely outside of my
wheelhouse so i don't really have
anything to contribute i just double
checked uh
the book that mike was referring to is
called fueling the adolescent
and that is available on kindle for 9.99
or if you have kindle unlimited it is
say free um yeah so i i would refer you
to
um you know either a uh what's it called
what's the doc
pediatrician or a uh an rn
fuck our d r d licensed
specifically to work with children or
extra extra experience working with
children
yeah so that's that's what i would have
on that um is that it for today
no we have uh two more oh my goodness
two or three more yeah david cook
who i thought it said i thought it was
cock
what a lame vanilla name yeah
look at this this is icon's a lowercase
d
come on david come on try
he says hey docs have a question about
rost magnitude and stimulus fatigue
ratio all bulky versus cutting
should i put the best raw stimulus
magnitude while massing or when cutting
for example leg press give me great
stimulation
they also exhaust me a lot split spots
give me tremendous stimulus and low
fatigue but are not meat potatoes
exercise
should i do leg press while bulking is
plus possible cutting or something else
no i think like
you don't have to do these like sort of
dogmatically either more categories but
you're
absolutely thinking in the right
direction remember that the thing is
that we always want as much rest in this
magnitude as possible
always however it's the fatigue cost we
may be less and more able to pay
so when you're in a cut the fatigue
costs just may be too much
so your best sfr exercises for sure have
to be done during the cutting phase
now you absolutely should try to do your
best sfr exercise while massing two
but it's okay to prioritize the high
rusty most magnitude ones
because they can make that breakthrough
growth that is
okay like it's justified because you're
massing and the fatigue
can't ever get too excessive because
you're recovering so well
so you can certainly go a little bit
biased towards rsm on massing but
heavily biased towards a safari and
cutting and i think that's totally great
james yeah i think that's a great
recommendation just keep in mind
right like mike said don't do this
dogmatically like essentially
you're going to be picking your best sfr
exercises
during periods of massing or cutting and
then not while you're doing maintenance
or
active rest or just dicking around so it
you don't have to necessarily separate
them into like mass versus cut
categories
because you can also run into the
problem that at some point you're going
to switch from massing to cutting or
vice versa
and you might just have exhausted a
movement
that you've been using for a while you
have to switch it just based on
variation so
don't worry about that stuff so much as
long as it's checking the sfr box for
you
um you can use it in massing and cutting
there are some kind of minute
differences in terms of the amount of
fatigue
that you're managing on a cut but again
for the most part i think you can kind
of have at it either way
um this is
i don't want to persevere too long on
this one because we've answered a bunch
of these over the
course as diogo symbolizes
yeah uh hi docs very simple question for
you dude another lockdown and poor to go
uh i i'm butchering that because you
know it's brazilian accent we always do
i think portuguese people hate
brazilians as far as i can tell yeah
it's okay um
real super quick side story when we were
i think we were in sydney
we had that portuguese cab driver so he
was from portugal
and he was a uber driver and mel just
happened to pick up on his accent
and she asked him in portuguese do you
speak portuguese and
he i i don't speak portuguese but you
could tell he was like
oh you speak brazilian like
you speak brazil because he was like oh
brazilera which is like oh like
feminine like you're you know brazilian
uh which was really funny and there's
definitely seems to be uh
we we kept trying to get thiago and um
our other friend
uh felipe who actually gave me this
shirt um
to talk shit and they just never do and
it's always disappointing yeah so
thiago's shy
and felipe's not shy but he quote hates
everything about brazil
in the language included even though
he's from there
he's like no man fuck that place all
right
we like it like we try to put them
together like okay have at it you two go
in there like
nah nope all right so
uh he says hi doc's very simple question
for you dude another lockdown portrait
going back to home workouts
i seem to have figured out our program
and everything um while using
a ring um calisthenics
and uh weight i own 30 kilograms plus 15
kilogram weight of vest right
the thing i struggle to get good on my
quads it took me a really long time
in the gym to figure out specific uh
deep hack squat machines to really hit
them with good sfr but i've struggled
a lot more to replicate or discover a
good exercise that doesn't just let
me my glutes take over any tips on quad
trainers first of all like
james isn't a that spans like english as
a second language and he's fucking
better at it than we are
that's gonna be fucking insane got
calisthenics in there that's a tough one
that's nuts like most americans don't
even know what that is
for sure like you speak better english
and most americans
and as a matter of fact you know look
who speaks
in america portuguese as well as you
nobody anyway
uh okay so because you have rings this
is actually easier
uh so this is really sweet um you can
like hold your hands onto the rings to
brace yourself and here's a
recommendation
single leg squats oh my god
just enough holding of the rings to make
sure that you're not falling over
and then fuck and single leg squats and
that'll fuck you up
um you can also set up no problem
especially with rings
and with the weight vest and the weight
you own um
a uh james just like called bulgarian
split squats or whatever
uh the split squats are fucking amazing
they'll fuck you up
um you can do those first until your
legs are real fucked up
and then you can do a very heel elevated
almost sissy squats
or 60 squats themselves superset of the
actual heel elevated squats
and that'll fuck you up to a point of no
return and then after that you put your
keep your weight vest on and do like
walking lunges
with as much weight as you have but stay
super upright and touch your knee gently
every single time you descend
so that your quads get a fuck load of
contraction and if you do that after
like
five to six sets of all that single leg
shit and some of that hack squat stuff
and then 60 squat stuff
you're going to be in a position where
like you're getting like
six lunges at a time and then you're
nearing failure and you have to stand
there for two or three seconds to get
another two or three and so on
and that's as good as leg training gets
so i think that those are my best
recommendations there
yeah and sometimes for a lot of these
movements if you are tend to be more of
a glute dominant person you might have
to do like extra heel elevation on some
of them and that's something i have to
tend to do in my home training a lot
where i wear the weightlifting shoe
and then i heal it up even more uh which
makes it really shitty but it really
eliminates a lot of the synergy from
like the hip extensors in a lot of those
movements
especially something like a split squat
where it's very easy to just let your
butt take over and do all the work
so i think those recommendations for
from mike are really good and then maybe
consider adding
even more heal elevation than normal for
me um
this is hit or miss so it might be a
miss for you it's a hit for me
sissy squats when you learn how to do
them in a way that is
very heavy on my muscle but doesn't blow
up your knees so for me what i'll do is
like a narrow um feet out
paused for one second sissy squat and i
actually
will hold on to something like the cage
the rings the rings yeah
rings so for me i need something more at
my chest height because
i will just out like lean back as far as
i can into it and that really seems to
help me keep it on the quads and not
hurt myself
whereas some people i think need to stay
a little bit more upright so i'm like
actually like going all the way back
when i do these and i have to hold on to
something at chest level so i don't
tip over backwards um if you're more
upright then you can hold on to
something like a ring and it won't be as
big of a deal so sissy squats
for me is it's like i said it's uh it's
hit or miss for some people but it's
definitely a good one for quads at home
but you have to dial them in in such a
way that doesn't blow up your knees
so for me um sometimes i'll do regular
high bar squats as like my main lift for
a session and then i might do
what are effectively down sets of sissy
squats at a higher rep range
just for some variation because i can
only do so many high bar squats before
it gets kind of stale and old so
that's one i use a lot
all right lastly is antoine barzon
i love that one very french
he says thanks a lot question mark
what about the crazy doms one can get
from full rom
stiff leg it doesn't i feel like i can
only train my hamstrings once a week if
i do
those and do not want overlapping doms
or i have to train with some kind of leg
curl on one day
say tuesday and then do the sldl uh on
the next
say wednesday i would have six whole
days between sldl session and the next
electoral session allowing me to get rid
of those damn doms
what do you think if anyone has similar
issues with sldl please feel free
to wait and holly solved it so i got a
couple of recommendations one take your
volume
and rir to even lower than you thought
was possible or higher for rar relative
effort lower
so what i mean is like if you're doing
like four sets of eight one rir and it
fucks up your hamstrings join the club
because james and i are right there with
you would absolutely make us all for a
week
the typical volumes for uh hip hinge
hamstring training are
often a fraction of those they are for
anything else because the exposure of
the hamstrings
to tension and stretch and everything
that makes them grow and damages them
it's fucking
insane right so it's a good thing so
maybe instead of four sets of eight
try one set of six and then be like oh
like i barely got sore then you can
train hamstrings two or three days later
then eventually you can work up to like
two to three sets of six or eight
and you can train hamstrings twice a
week and yes it is probably a good idea
just to make sure the muscle is fully
developed
and for fatigue management purposes to
do one hip hinge day a week
and one leg curl day a week but i would
split them a little bit more evenly
you'll have to do way more leg curls
than hip hinges to get the same
degree of hamstring disruption so those
are my two best recommendations and my
last one
is they keep doing stuff like a
deadlifts with relatively low volume
and eventually you kind of get more used
to them the novelty effect at least goes
away
and then you notice that you are getting
sore and you can do a little bit more
volume but fundamentally it's a real
good thing
your hamstrings grow super easily they
get sore super easily
uh and that's the deal just do much less
volume than you think
is necessary in most cases yeah that's
absolutely the the key issue and very
often what you'll find is that if you
haven't done
slds for a minute um the mev is often
like one set
and sometimes even like a really unusual
i mean you could do like one set of like
five rir and you're probably
good to go and then what you find is
that okay the next week maybe you do one
set again
at like two rar you're like okay that's
better uh and then you maybe add a set
the next week so you're doing two sets
at two or something like that
um the progression can be like unusually
slow and when you're looking at it
you're like this is stupid what am i
doing
uh but it's just such a raw stimulus uh
exercise for the hamstrings that you
just take you got to dial it back
there's a it's kind of an outlier in
terms of a lot of exercises in the
progressions because it's just so
novel in that regard the other thing you
can also consider
is using some different variations so
like
kind of as we talked about earlier in
the webinar i do mostly home gym pretty
much virtually all home gym
so with your hip hinge movements they
get stale and you have to think of
different ways of kind of keeping them
fresh so you can consider
doing something like uh deficit sldls
no belt sl sldls um
least effective shoe variants so a lot
of people are really strong with a flat
shoe
and weaker with a weightlifting shoe you
can mix that up you can do beltless you
can do
wide grip there's all sorts of crazy
little things you can do sometimes i'll
do them
with the um the the shrug bar
just just for some variation just
because like i said
that when you're working with barbells
and dumbbells and that's pretty much it
like they do tend to kind of stale out
quickly now you can play around with
your grips in your foot position and
stuff but
it is good to mix those up in case you
start to um
run into the situation where you do have
to do like four sets of eight because
your meds gotten up there
and that's when it's about time to
switch to something else
oh that's it
all right so again thanks for joining us
on this one a friendly reminder for
next time we're gonna switch to a
bi-weekly schedule
so that means we're gonna record on the
first and third weeks of the month which
typically means that they will get
posted early in the second and fourth
weeks of the month so
we're basically going to be staggered
with dr spencer's videos
i'm sure there's still going to be other
videos kind of going out every week i
think we're kind of shooting for
i want to say like three to four ish if
i remember correctly videos per week
something like that yep
the weekly webinar will be staggered um
every other week at this point so
we just want to get some videos to get a
little bit more attention a little bit
more shine and that's why we're doing it
so
make sure you guys keep subscribing
still got plenty of good stuff on the
way we appreciate all the good questions
we saw
people were getting up votes of like 46
which was really good
on today's webinar so i really like to
see the engagement on that so great job
everybody dr mike anything before we
sign out
all right that's about it all right
folks thanks for joining us again
subscribe and we will see you next time
