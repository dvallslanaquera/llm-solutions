morning guys uh so this morning I woke
up a new way in low of uh
156.8 my previous low was
157.6 so I'm down about a pound this
week and we're gonna try a new breakfast
this morning so the chocolate and
sprinkle pancakes so when you're dieting
you just want everything to be as
colorful as possible or I do anyway so
we added some sprinkles in the pancakes
and I'm gonna put some chocolate peanut
butter on those so I don't know if you
guys know this little hack or not but
well Robin was the one who showed it to
me tear the scale with the peanut butter
on it and then take it what you want so
I want eight grams so I'll just take it
out until 8 grams shows up
X
and then on the side I've also got Greek
yogurt with mixed berries so
that's breakfast the goals for this meat
are just to maximize on my Wilkes I
should be able to post a higher Wilkes
score than I did at the Nova Scotia meet
just because I'm weighing about
uh seven pounds less yeah about seven
pounds less and I don't think I've lost
that much strength and even if I did I
didn't lift at my full potential at the
Nova Scotia meet so my goal is to match
match the numbers or at least match the
total that I had at the Nova Scotia meet
if I don't quite do that I'm not gonna
be beat up about it or anything as long
as my Wilk stays the same or ideally it
would improve on the barbecue I'm gonna
put on these now in a second it's a
extra lean beef burger patty and another
salmon burger these are
zesty zesty salmon burgers uh Jamie
Oliver
and these are what the macros look like
on those so I'm gonna have one salmon
burger
compliments white hamburger buns they're
really low calorie uh 110 calories in
one bun garlic and herb Laughing Cow
Cheese and this stuff is delicious if
you haven't tried it I highly recommend
it fat free Miracle Whip Greek yogurt
has kind of like a sour cream substitute
pizza mozzarella
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
about to weigh
so guys we're going to Walmart to get
some goodies for the meat tomorrow
no but she's been wanting these for a
long time there's the other the Ritz
cracker ones
[Music]
oh look at these yeah there's Ritz
oh look what I see
I don't think I want to get those though
they make me kind of filming pretzels
are looking essential
Glacier cherry Gatorade
Gatorades were on four for five so got
Robin a couple g2s
a couple regular full sugar Gatorades
these granola bars are you sure you want
those if you got these
yeah I wanted the marshmallow ones
and the grand one but these are the same
thing pretty much except they have their
yeah that's true okay go with those but
these are cheaper
that should do it the rest of the stuff
will get uh
uh right I love Captain Underpants books
and when I dye it I just get a random
craving to read fiction
see oh I also really want to read this
and Robin keeps telling me not to buy it
but I read that first one Mr Mercedes
oh yeah I have some salts so we may you
know I'm gonna probably cut a few pounds
just because I'm trying to get my Wilkes
as high as I can so we'll fill up the
bath with epsom salts
now we're getting Pedialyte which I'm
gonna get the Apple because that's the
only
one so yeah this is just like a baby's
electrolyte solution
to help babies who have like really bad
diarrhea and also power lifters who cut
weight
all right
so we're just gonna grab a little bit of
FroYo before get on the road
so yeah it's all about the colors
so I just estimate that on my fitness
pal I just go yeah Greek because it's
Greek honey yogurt and 110 calories
about 100 grand
10 extra I got 15 extra carb macros just
to account for the strawberries
sprinkles and so on
whoa this is nice
check out the couch the TV
oh there is a mini fridge that's good
Yeah we actually got the honeymoon suite
but it's a
yeah middle of nowhere Hotel yeah
super tired we just drove for
four hours
which I guess isn't that fair giving
what we're used to uh meat day gym bag
essentials so all the stuff you'd make
you want to make sure that you have with
you on the day so first and foremost the
basic stuff uh you want to make sure
that you have your uh card of the
organization that you compete in so for
me it's the CPU you're single it so for
me that's
basic ends are blue if you wear knee
sleeves you want to make sure you have
those I wear the SBD large even though
uh I should be wearing a medium now
because I've lost a bit of weight those
are actually pretty loose on me but they
did fit when I was about 10 pounds
heavier
uh you'll want some knee-high socks so I
have the SPD deadlift socks you want a
pair though I bring a extra pair of
socks just in case like I don't know
those get wet or something I also bring
a pair of just regular socks because I
don't like to wear the deadlift socks
when I swap so I'll bring just like a
regular pair of black socks to wear when
I squat and bench in underwear
uh if you're a dude you have to make
sure you have like tighty whities or
something that basically doesn't have
any part of a like a pant or anything so
then if you have a belt you'll want to
bring that so for me I have the inzer 10
millimeter forever lever belt
[Music]
I think medium so
I squat in
the Adidas power lifts
um
ideally I would probably go with a shoe
with a little bit more of a solid heel
than these I find that these do tend to
sink just a little bit and they're also
not quite as tight of a fit as I'd like
ideally but they've done the trick I've
squat up to 500 pounds in need with
these so
um I'm gonna continue to roll with those
and then for deadlifts I just kick it
old school with my Converse chalks
so uh I wear these when I binge too
um then you'll also want to make sure
that you have a clipboard or something
that you can use to record your meat
attempts with so range is set up for
opener second and third attempts
depending on how warm-ups go right you
don't want to have everything set in
stone it's a good idea to have some
numbers written down especially if
you're not familiar with kilograms so
you can make your attempt selections
fairly quickly
um because after you complete a lift as
many of you guys probably know you only
have one minute to get your next attempt
submitted you want to make sure that you
have a good handle on what potential
numbers you're looking at I want to make
sure that you have a phone charger you
have your music on your phone or if you
want to like post something or whatever
it's annoying if your phone dies
obviously and it's also a good idea to
have some money on hand so I actually
have a fancy little phone slot where I
can you know keep my credit cards and
all that kind of stuff do you have any
like aches or pains I just have this
stuff is uh pretty mild but it's rub
a535 Tiger Bomb is something that's a
little bit stronger or I've used
Voltaren in the past too I don't notice
a huge difference between Voltaren and
a535 and then also Advil or Ibuprofen
just went to the drugstore and got some
basic caffeine anhydrous tabs so those
are good headphones of course
also a good idea to have gum or some
mints uh just in case you have to cut
weight so if you're ordering on a weight
class a spit in a cup and if you cut
water it's really really hard to get any
salivary flow going so uh chewing some
gum or having a mint in your mouth it's
a really good way to stimulate some
saliva flow and you can actually drop a
little bit of weight like this and I
wouldn't rely on it but it's always a
good idea to have some of that handy
surprise how many people go to meats and
don't have pens and they can't write
down their attempts on their attempt
tickets with a foam roller or if you use
a lacrosse ball or whatever to work out
any knots it's always a good idea also
to actually do a physical checklist
before you go to a meet and of course
how could I forget um it's a good idea
to have snacks we actually have those
out in the car it's baby powder so
people will often put baby powder on
their thighs when they do a deadlift so
that the bar doesn't kind of get caught
up on your skin so just rub some baby
powder on your thighs another thing is
Pedialyte so if you are cutting water
for an uh if you're going to be
dehydrated it's a good idea to replenish
all those electrolytes and fully a good
idea to dilute that 50 50 with water and
Gatorade can work fine as well so we
have Gatorade too is ammonia Caps or
nose torque I don't actually use those
smelled ammonia in the chem lab for many
years in my undergrad and the smell is
just intoxicating to me I hate it so I
can't possibly see how that would psych
me up before a big lift so I just don't
use it but some people find that they
get quite a buzz from that so that could
be something that you might want to
include in your meat day gym bag as well
all right guys so I just weighed in at
70.25 kilos so it's about
154.5 pounds and now we're on our way
into Tim Hortons to get some breakfast
hash brown coffee
say English Muffin breakfast sandwich
two egg patties turkey sausage cheese
thing but egg white and I have bran
muffin
generates on Deck
what
come on up up easy peace
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
all right guys so um we just finished up
with squats Robin and I both went three
for three
and uh I ended up getting two and a half
kilos less than what I got from my third
attempt at the last week but I'm also 10
pounds lighter
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
press
it doesn't disappoint he's six for six
for the day all right guys so bench is
done I tied my all-time leap year of 353
pounds or 106 kilos
at this point uh I'm on track to get a 4
30 Wilson qualify me for the Arnold
Classic in 2016. so I basically just
need to bust out a 475 deadlift in order
to make that qualifying standard yeah
thank you
[Music]
easy stuff for the big guys
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
good job
[Music]
foreign
didn't go exactly as I had hoped I
missed my last attempt of 215 kilos
which is uh 475 pounds something I
easily would have got probably uh you
know 10 pounds ago but at this later
body weight I guess your leverages tend
to change and I just didn't have it in
me on this day so I finished with a
better Wilkes than I got at the Nova
Scotia meet uh last month I guess it was
so I was really pleased with that
and tied my all-time bench Pier at any
body weight of 353 so I was pleased with
that and squats went better than
expected and honestly I didn't think
that I would even have a chance to get a
430 Wilkes but
the plates got off the ground but it
just wasn't in the tank today
and so now the sleeping with the Wilkes
424 which is six points shy of the
qualifying standards so my options are
either to try to get a nomination of
some sort or compete again at Easterns
where I'll be competing at a lighter
body weight so the goal would just be to
maintain the strength I have now and get
that 430 Wilkes
