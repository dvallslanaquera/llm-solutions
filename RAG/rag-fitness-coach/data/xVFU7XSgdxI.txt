hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today we are going to
learn tips tricks mistakes not to make
for the bent over barbell row for
hypertrophy
for back hypertrophy not just lat
hypertrophy
a lot of people say oh bent row for the
lats cool the bent row can be an
excellent tool for the lats but
it is more than that it is an excellent
tool for the lats the spinal erectors
the lower medium and upper traps
the rhomboids and the teres major as
well all of the major muscles that pull
or support pulling in the back are
awesomely hit by the bent row
let's take a look step by step so what
kind of mistakes are super common
and how to fix them
all right folks here with charlie jung
my training partner friend so to speak
and
rp's athlete manager at charlton banks
on instagram if you want to know the
living out of him
he's going to be demoing bent rose for
us uh first mistake
is not hinging far enough what this ends
up doing
is because you're not bent over very far
it's a cool way to train the traps i
guess
but the rest of your muscles just don't
get a huge range of motion
and the load you have to use to get the
reps you want has to be super high
what this does is it creates a lot of
axial loading through your spine
fatigues the out of you for all
your other back and leg training
it's just not worth the stimulus so
charlie go ahead and
do some rows where you bend only like a
tiny little bit and do this you
only have to do cheat rows you can they
can be strict
but like people will row right here like
that's a fine and dandy thing but how
much range of motion are you getting
remember full range of motion
is better for hypertrophy than partial
range and has been shown a whole bunch
of times in
scientific literature so what charlie's
going to do is try to hinge
as far as he can without rounding his
lower back she's going to feel as tight
hamstrings
for him that happens to be all the way
to ground do you have to roll all the
way to the ground
no if you can only hinge down to your
knees and everything else start
surrounding your back
then for the classic barbell bent row
that's as far as you go but slowly over
time you'll get more flexible you can go
deeper
some folks can hinge all the way down to
row what would really be below the
ground they'd have to create a deficit
for themselves
that's totally awesome you don't have to
go super deep
but don't go super super high
feel your whole back opening up you
should at least be at 45 degrees
or below in almost every case do you
have to go all the way to 90 and
in negative degrees no that's an option
but at least 45 that's where the
negotiation begins charlie shows what
that looks like do a couple of rows so
in proper position
so he's gonna all the way down the
ground you're gonna notice his lower
back is nice and tight his chest is up
he's gonna roll into his tummy and back
down and row into his tummy
and back down that's a proper bent over
row
next mistake is letting your lower back
round during the row a lot of times this
happens folks trying to go super deep
but they don't have the flexibility
fundamentally your risk of injury with
riding the lower back with
rolling weights versus deadlift weights
isn't super high
and a lot of people who've been rounding
the backs for a while can get pretty
good at it
and because they've adapted that
position injury risk is not a super huge
concern although i would still say
it's a notable concern what we really
want here is to make sure
that as much force is transmitted
through the arms
and the back and no force is limited
with an improper position that doesn't
allow a lot of force transduction here's
the fundamental fact
in many cases of rowing not all but many
if you round over your back
you actually can't use your pulling
muscles nearly as much
because your rounded back isn't a solid
transmitter or force and it becomes the
limiting factor a lot of times your
erectors will fatigue like that
and then all of a sudden it's a movement
just for your erectors and not much of
anything else
the deadlift's a great move for that
there's another movement called the
flexion row which is a move
specifically for that but for barbell
rows we want the upper back to be
working really really well
so you want to keep a nice rigid core to
keep our lower back tight
charlie show us what it looks like when
you round your lower back trying to do
rows
so people will reach down and just start
rolling from here right look at that cat
back
that's fine but it's not going to allow
us to transmit a ton of force where we
want it
how do you fix this willfully arch your
back begin to get into neutral spine
boom that is a really good starting and
holding position
for all of your rows
a big part of the purpose of barbell
rose is to train
your middle traps your rhomboids and a
bunch of the other musculature
there that actually functions to
retract the scapula okay so
when you stretch at the bottom of a row
you should be protracting
sometimes the weight is so heavy that
you can't really retract a ton that's
maybe better for machine rows
but at the very least you should be
protracting completely at the bottom
while keeping your lower back tight
tough trick to do you don't want to
remain rigid
and stabilize your scapula for no reason
i swear to god
half the people on the internet
say random like you should be
keeping your scaps stable
why there's a ton of musculature
attached to your scapula
that actually powers their movement and
you want that jacked because it
gives you a huge back
you want your scapula to be stretched
and protracted at the bottom
ideally you want it to come back at the
top even if it doesn't come back all the
way
at least you want that big eccentric
stretch charlie show us what it looks
like when someone is artificially
stable scapula in the row it's not a
dangerous thing
it's just kind of pointless what they're
going to do is roll like that
and then sort of yep and it looks like
they're cutting the range of motion
yeah their elbow is getting straight but
they're missing a lot of good stuff now
show us what a proper
row looks like on the way down his back
sinks
and then comes up and stretches and then
contracts
and his shoulders and scapulae are
moving which is
part of the movement and gives you that
awesome
gnarly especially middle trap
development to make you look
bulletproof
the next mistake in the row is not
letting your arms get to a dead hang
it's part of the same problem as keeping
your scapulae completely stable
it doesn't allow you to fully stretch
the back musculature remember
stretching under tension is a huge
hypertrophy stimulator
dead hang or if you go to the ground
keep
upright enough for it to basically be a
dead hang as you touch is way better
than stopping arbitrarily yeah of course
you can lift more weight if you don't go
all the way down
but you're ripping yourself off charlie
shows what it looks like when someone's
just rowing
they touch their tummy but they end up
not going all the way down
so they touch and then they come back up
yep and sure they can get a ton of reps
but look they're not letting all the
back do the work
now do it properly super stretch and up
and
super big stretch and up now we're
working
this is what we want
the next problem in the bent row is
again super super common
not touching your tummy when you come
all the way up
by touching your tummy you get a
standard of
where each row ends and begins because
hypothetically you're going to a dead
hang which may or may not be the ground
and you're touching your tummy every
single time you know that it's the same
range of motion every single time
that means you can track your progress
track your performance and impose
the same degree of stimulus the needed
degree of stimulus
every single time must be
totally honest
why don't people touch their tummy and
rose because they already failed
they're just trying to flail around a
bit more i have no idea how you count
reps like that they're no longer
stimulating what you want
it's just bad news it's tough to touch
your tummy you'll have to roost the
weight on the bar
just do fewer reps or hey here's an idea
 get stronger
charlie shows what it looks like when
people don't touch their tummy on the
rows
no swinging that's another problem we'll
talk about later
they come up yeah you know so that's
sort of a row
yeah maybe and then yeah who knows and
you know
partial range of motion not a good thing
convincingly touch your tummy every
single time now real quick
some people say where in the tummy
should i touch honestly wherever's comfy
can you touch the lower tummy sure
that's more lats less
rhomboids and upper or middle traps and
stuff like that
if you touch higher on the tummy
especially if you start touching to the
chest
that's a bit more rear delts a bit of
the more upper back musculature
uh upper traps middle traps rhomboids on
and so forth there's no right answer
there those are all different
very very awesome variations of rows and
why not take another tip out just on
this rant alone
what's better barbell rows with a normal
grip
with a wide grip underhand parallel
what are the better rows where do i put
the bar there's no correct answer to
that they're all
awesome you can do underhand rows like
dorian yates did if you feel it where
you want to feel it
and it's awesome on your joints and it
doesn't feel like a terrible amount of
work
for very little return but if you feel
really really good with all the target
muscles you're hitting
with an overhand grip that's totally
fine if you try wide grip rows and they
feel like they're not for you
try them a couple more times and see if
you can work out a technique that works
if you still hate them
you don't have to do them you can do any
kind of row variation you want with grip
they're all super super awesome as long
as you feel it in the target musculature
of your back and your joints are not
paying a heavy price
two mistakes in one and they're very
very related
first mistake is using body english
momentum
and muscles not targeted in the row to
do the work
this happens when people swing their
hips they'll even move their knees
they'll do the check and dance at the
top of their head to move the weight
the purpose of the barbell bent row is
not to move the weight it is to
stimulate your back
it is to use your back to move the
weight that's problem number one and a
very related problem that we're going to
demo at the same time
is people don't have the same range of
motion every single time
some reps will be full range some won't
how do you count that how do you track
consistently
there's no way to do it so two things
one your
hips should be completely stable only
your arms and your scapula move when you
row
period and second and because of that
every row touches the tummy
or wherever you're touching whatever as
long as you choose a certain location
and secondly
every row touches the ground and or goes
to a dead hang so charlie
show us the most dog evil cheating
row you can
rip yourself off
yeah fight to win brother yeah
you're doing something
something's happening i like the head
movement is really critical
this is what gets your back going right
but in a proper row go ahead and
demonstrate
one solid position watch his hips go
ahead and row charlie his hips are going
 nowhere because this is not a
hip exercise
his scapula are moving his arms are
moving and that's all
we want
next mistake is not to control the
eccentric
or the descent on the row remember
eccentric control
actually contributes significantly to
hypertrophy it's a good thing it's a
wanted thing
the purpose of a row isn't to get a
bunch of rows done is to stimulate the
muscles doing so
a lot of folks ask what about pendley
rose aren't they great they're
absolutely
wonderful for developing strength in the
back and the pulling musculature
for the sport of weightlifting which
really doesn't have a huge eccentric
component
so that's a really low fatigue way in
order to develop that sort of concentric
strength
but in the penalty row is a great
exercise the big downside
is that it's not a controlled eccentric
so bentley rows are almost
hypertrophy rows for bodybuilding but
not quite
almost the same thing the only fixes
control eccentric so charlie show us
basically a penalty row not exactly but
close
where the concentric looks great there's
no hip swinging but we just drop it
right after
boom and row and then boom right that's
all nice and well
gravity's taking the weight back down
you don't want gravity to take it
unassisted you want to fight gravity on
the way back
because those lengthening contractions
of your muscles are very hypertrophic as
are
concentric contractions and isometric we
want all three
so charlie show us a proper row not only
are we going
up with really good technique touch
gently but we're controlling it doesn't
have to be a four second eccentric
just some kind of control is a really
really good idea
mistake in the row is to let grip be a
limiting factor
if you get strong and for high reps
barbells are really tough to grab for a
while
and what you might get to is you're
failing because your grip
is failing you not because your back is
feeling you which is what you really
want
so there are three solutions to this
like with many other exercises one
get some chalk really really good idea
sometimes chalk isn't enough when you
get really really strong
your back will outpace you straps are
really really good idea
and the best of course are versa grips
look them up they're amazing
they're going to make it so that every
single row every single pulling movement
you do is limited only
by your pulley musculature and not your
forms and here's another really
interesting very super related myth i'd
like to address was the idea when people
ask like hey
should i be using straps or versa grips
or chalk
a lot of times they don't say chalk just
straps reverse grips for
back work four rows and a lot of people
say that
you gotta get your whole
body strong
so it's a crutch you know like
yeah if you're training for the
unassisted row olympics
sure then you don't want to use you know
anything other than rowing
and you want to use your own hands
because that's what it's going to come
down to but the thing is
if you really want stronger grip sure a
lot of unassisted stuff is really good
but also you should be training your
grip you know what i'm saying at home by
yourself
like we all do but on a serious note all
sorts of wrist curls and various
grippers
are really really awesome to use to
train your grip in addition to that
stuff but here's the thing
if you want to maximally develop the
back your back
we'll be stronger than your grip
for almost everyone in the world
especially people with the biggest backs
your back's just bigger and it's
gonna outpace your grip
it's like trying to calf raise and squat
the same weight you just can't
 calf raise 400 pounds it just
the muscles are smaller they're not well
as well leveraged
it just doesn't work not everything is
going to be in balance so if you find
yourself especially
you know if you're training for a year
or two yeah don't use straps or any
other stuff get your grip stronger fine
right after that especially when you
notice like look i
my my forearms are fried after a set of
rows my back doesn't really feel as much
as it used to from rose what the hell's
going on
it's not rocket science get some straps
get some chalk
better yet get some versa grips let your
back
be the thing that fails you because then
it's getting the most growth and if
you're really concerned
about foreign hypertrophy just
masturbate more no wait i said that
wrong
do that but also train your grip
independently
the last mistake in barbell bent rows
for hypertrophy is going either too
heavy
or too light on the too heavy side you
may notice this from your own analysis
of the stimulus to fatigue ratio
how much your muscles are actually
taking a hit versus how fatiguing the
movement is
you know how much tension you're
perceiving how much of a pump you're
getting
how much disruption you feel in the back
afterwards that rows
in the five to ten rep range especially
closer to five
sometimes you just feel like it's mostly
core work at that point the support is
the hardest part
and your back just doesn't get enough
time or reps to really get working and
really get going
for some people that's the case so for
them rowing in the 5-10 rep range might
not be great you ask yourself
how the hell if i have faster twitch
lats or whatever
how the hell am i supposed to grow my
lats grow parts of my back
with the heaviest range well we got two
exercises
that can replace the row in that regard
in that rep range
we have weighted pull-ups which are
awesome in the 5-10 rep range if you've
ever done them
and we have deadlifts deadlifts are a
 amazing back builder
but by definition should be done in the
five to 10 rep range because deadlifts
over that is just cardio right
so save deadlifts and and weighted pull
ups for the five to ten rep range
what about the 20 to 30 rep range well a
lot of times again it becomes a
stability problem your spinal rashes
just start to get tired
and it's not that your upper back isn't
working anymore
it's that your spinal erectors and your
posture and even your glutes and
hamstrings sometimes
can be the limiting factor you're trying
to row and you're like i'm collapsing
i'm just getting tired i can't maintain
this position
so bent rows in the 23rd rep range some
people can do them
other folks it really starts to be a
factor that's limited by other things
and not actually your upper back
those are best done with chest supported
rows
machine rows cable rows etc so 20 to 30
not ideal for bent rows in most cases 5
to 10 not ideal
that means bent rows are best done
especially on a first set
if fresh 10 to 20 rep range that is
really really awesome for metro's my
personal recommendation start around
sets of 15
and you're gonna feel super super
awesome folks that's all i have for
today
those are the fundamental main bent row
mistakes try to do a good job in your
own training
perceive how much stimulus you're
getting stay away from too much fatigue
joint pain and crazy high efforts do a
really awesome job
