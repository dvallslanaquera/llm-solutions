a lot of people think of the incline
press as just an upper Peck exercise and
it's like oh no what's going to happen
to my mid and lower that is completely
blown out of proportion there was a
recent study that compared flat bench to
incline bench for the lower pecs same
growth for the pecs same growth for the
upper PEC better growth with incline
again that's only one study but it does
tell us that the incline press doesn't
just Target the upper pecs it will grow
your entire peack I don't think there is
a best if you feel a shallow really
really well in your pecs then it
probably is better I prefer something
between like 30 and 45° if I get over
45° I start to feel a lot more shoulders
and a lot less Peck
