little kid and I don't know man this is
going to get dark real quick your
parents are fighting in the other room
and you pray to God and you're like
please send me an angel and then like
the door busts open open and kiro's like

like why yes sir he's said tucks his
angel wings through the door feathers
fall everywhere he's like come with me

whatever the in any case you're gonna
have a good time
