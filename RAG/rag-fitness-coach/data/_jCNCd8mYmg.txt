hey folks
dr michael is here for renaissance
periodization strength training made
simple number 13. holy crap we have a
lot of videos
how to prioritize specific lifts that
you want to work on first question real
quick
is why should we prioritize well you
just want to increase a certain lift
uh more than it has been like your
squat's going up your bench is going up
your deadlift is going up but your
deadlift's not going up as much as you
want and your squat adventure going up
pretty fast
and someone's like hey what are you dead
lifting you're like
when you go home and you're like man i
gotta get my deadlift up all right
it could be a consideration for you know
in competition i'm always like
you know the first to deadlift and it's
embarrassing or my total could be higher
if the
one lift really came up totally all
those things are valid but really at the
end of the day you just want to increase
one life more than the others you see
more than the others
can't i just increase all my lifts you
can but it always comes as a trade-off
if you train all the lifts the same
amount
same effort intensity frequency etc
they're all going to go up a certain
amount and genetically some are going to
go up faster than others
if you want one lift to go up faster
the other two lifts have to go up less
fast period
less fast than they could have it's
always a trade-off there is no way to
maximize all lifts there's a way to
increase all of it by just doing a good
job
but to maximize any one lift you have to
minimize
the other two lifts plain and simple
all right so to that end let's say
you're like okay fine fine fine
i need to get my bench press up my squad
and deadlifts are good i don't want to
just crap them out but my bench needs to
go up
what do i do well we have a six part
plan for you it's super simple super
straight the point
if you're serious about maximizing a
lift it is not a matter of just benching
a little bit more
for like three weeks and testing your
max bs you're not going to get that on
this channel you're getting the works
here we go first
you want to do a hypercaloric
hypertrophy phase
for the supporting muscles of that lift
so if someone comes to me i'm like
doctor mike i need a bigger bench the
first thing i say is check this out you
weigh how much they're like uh 180 like
all right
in three months i want you to weigh 190
and during those three months and i want
you to train for hypertrophy for
strength that's a five to ten
and i want you to make your chest and
triceps and front delts
bigger much bigger choosing lots of
those kinds of exercises
to target those muscles because the
number one underlying truth behind a big
bench
is big ass pecs big ass triceps and big
ass front delts you know the guy that's
mentioned that most of the meat when you
walk in and he's weighing in you're like
the fuck happened to that guy's upper
chest
fuck i thought i was going to win this
meet nope not a bench press you aren't
so first build bigger muscles and notice
i said hypercaloric
a lot of people will do this the
hypertrophy phases
but they don't change in body weight
where the hell are you supposed to be
getting new muscle from thin air
no thanks and even if you can recomp not
good enough we want the best
possible tools we're gonna put on some
weight it works for every single lift
now number two that prioritized lift
or the muscle groups when you're
training for hypertrophy you're gonna
train it more often so however many
times you've been benching let's see
even benching or doing push
two times a week if you're serious about
increasing your bench not only do you do
point number one but on point number two
you go at least one more probably just
one more to start so
three times a week you might have to
lower the volumes within each session a
little bit to accommodate that but
generally higher frequency works super
well
temporarily not sustainably to really
increase a particular lift
or get particular muscles bigger so
increase the frequency by one
is point number two point number three
you're going to have to make some room
fatigue wise for your body's recovery
resources to float more towards the lift
you want and less towards the others
which means you have to lower the volume
of the other lift it just has to happen
especially
if the muscles involved are similar for
example if you really
really really want to bring up your
squad you got to bring your deadlift
training down a little bit
because if you just crank the deadlift
as hard as possible your glutes are
tired your hamstrings are tied your
posterior chain is tired
yeah you can make gains in the squat but
you can make better gains if
those muscles and movements were not as
tired then your squat workouts could be
amazing versus just really good and you
get better gain so make sure to pair
things down just a little bit at least
you never put stuff on maintenance but
at least on the back burner minimum
effective volume maybe not full
maintenance
full maintenance if you're completely
serious though so if you have to bring
up your bench
and your squadron deadlifts are super
solid for a couple of months you're
going to be putting your squat and
deadlift on maintenance volumes and
maintenance loads and so on and so forth
and just
really crank in your bench that's
absolutely a choice you can make number
four
in most of the weekly sessions once you
train that prioritized lift or those
muscle groups you're gonna train them
first
okay so i've seen people say oh i want
to bring up my bench like let me see
your workout
and then like multiple workouts a week
it's like squats first then pulls
because they're stronger at those and
they really like them and they bench
last like what do you think like i think
that if you're really serious about
getting your bench up
the bench goes first like uh then i'm
tired for squats or whatever for
deadlifts like well yeah but who cares
because you want to bring up the bench
you want to train it fresh
plain and simple point number five
the hardest session or sessions of that
lift
should be placed in the week after rest
day or rest days
for example if you really want to bring
up your bench
and you train monday through friday
saturday sunday off guess what your
biggest bench workout of the week is
going to be guess when it's going to be
monday right because after two days off
you're fresh you're ready you're going
to
smash that bench workout what you don't
want is if you tell people you're
serious about bringing up your bench
but like you bench like thursday you're
like why
monday tuesday like but doesn't that
mean that they're fresh system to get
the most work and by the time you get to
bench pressing thursday you're kind of
just systemically tired like
yeah but i don't bench that much so it's
like well that's why you don't match
that much
so definitely consider putting your best
work
in the days after that you've had the
days off that's a really good idea and
lastly when you are choosing exercises
choose the ones that have the highest
raw stimulus magnitudes not necessarily
the ones
that have the best stimulus to fatigue
ratios those are good too
but you've lowered all your other
volumes so the fatigue isn't as big of a
concern
raw stimulus magnitude means exercises
that while they may be fatiguing
crush you and really open up your
abilities to get
better so if you say man i tell you what
every time i do deficit deadlifts
they bring my deadlift up like crazy but
they just
mess up everything and benching kind of
sucks and squatting kind of sucks well
guess what if you're serious about
bringing up your deadlift
bench and squash should be on the back
burner anyway it doesn't matter if you
mess them up
you're going to be doing a whole lot of
deficit that that's big raw stimulus
magnitude the ability to improve a lift
everything else be damned then you do a
couple of message cycles of deficit
pulls
you get back into regular diet thinking
holy shit i put on 30 pounds of my
deadlift
voila through training it properly folks
give this some thought
implement it if you'd like we'll see you
for the next video next time
