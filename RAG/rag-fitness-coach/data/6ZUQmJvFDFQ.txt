welcome back
today i thought i'd take you through
a day in life
so
currently
this is week four
day five which means last day of heart
training for this month's cycle and
i am feeling it i have a cold i
don't feel like training
um
but ultimately
i'm gonna do what needs to get done
i woke up had breakfast
got dressed and now i'm almost ready to
go to the gym
personally i find that starting the
session
any way you can like as in
even if it's just committing to
the fast more upset committing to
anything at all
helps me to get going and then once i'm
going i can usually get through it
but just committing
to that initial easier part then gets me
to
the harder part that i really don't want
to do
i woke up a little bit late because i
went to sleep a little bit late
yesterday
um
so i'm slightly behind
but i'll be heading to the gym about 10
minutes and then oh man so i just
checked my program and i have
five sets of squats
four sets of split squats
two sets of leg curls and five six cap
raises
i am not looking for this
and on top of that i have an am session
and a pm session
and because my weekends are usually days
off from trading
my friday sessions are usually brutal so
let's do it
usually about an hour before
my aim session and my pm session
i'll take
200 milligrams of caffeine
and eight to 10 grams of central amount
so
for me that's around
8 30 a.m i take those and then again
around
3 p.m because my aim session is usually
around
9 30 a.m and my p.m sessions usually
around
[Music]
quarter past 4 p.m
all right starting session now something
i don't see
many people discuss
is
so
generally speaking
after bike training
you're pretty serious fatigue and so
trying to do
much of anything
tends not to be reproductive
and that's why whatever you trade first
in the session
typically sees the raised effect
moreover
um
calves
insert the ankle and so
if you want more range of motion during
the squatting walk on the life pressing
one and stuff like that
training your calves fast
calf raises for example
can then allow you to be more mobile
by the timing squat and get you more
quadratic motion
and so i think for those two reasons
first being
calves fast you're not fatigued from the
rest of your body work and realistically
doing cats fast
isn't going to impact your squatting
versus vice versa
and secondly because doing calves first
might make you more mobile and then
enhance your ranking motion through
portrait
for those two reasons i think treating
caps fast can make sense
[Music]
[Music]
i'm about to jump into my
bustle squad
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
i now have
one set of split squats remaining
i'm basically dead
calls
last leg session on that cycle
[Music]
i am
very excited
so i wasn't able to record the last
circles
i'm cramping so bad i can barely walk
um so apologies to that one
but i got it done
all right session is done now
just on my way to meet my
phd supervisors
and my colleague
park
aka pokerots
for a quick meeting
we have these meetings every now and
again
just to discuss phd stuff
research stuff um and also just catch up
because we're in pretty good times so
all right on the way home from
the media now
um got some steps in
very hungry so i'm gonna head home
have food
wash a couple hours and then go to my pm
session
all right just came back from that
walk-in meeting
and now i'm actually combining meals two
and three for today
because i didn't have time to eat
milkshake when i was supposed to so i'm
just combining them now
and i am
looking forward to it
so this is meal two two sandwiches with
honey cured ham mustard and salad
with wholemeal bread
and then
rice with chicken mushroom and bean
sprouts brown rice specifically
so yeah i'll dig in now also look who it
is
no that's not for you
don't even nope
bye
all right so i just finished taking a
shower um after eating
i spent some time thinking of some admin
stuff like
ordering some more zero carry noodles
planning out a grocery order um
planning out my trip to birmingham next
week
for the arnold expo uh planning out my
eating for the nutritional peak
so i have three photo shoots coming up
in about a week and a week and a half
respectively roughly
um and so i was planning out what foods
to eat especially when i'm traveling to
birmingham
so that's all i've planned out now now's
the shower and i'm about to get dressed
for
my pm session
quick um physique update apparently
that's what these uh
vloggers do
yeah
i mean lighting isn't ideal but
so because of my current metacycle
i have two rest days on saturdays and
sundays
my friday sessions tend to be quite hard
since i have two full rest days
afterwards it makes sense for me to
train everything like my whole body
pretty hard because i'll have at least
72 hours before i hit that body part
again
and so my lower body session this
morning was
quads hamstrings glutes and calves
and then the upper body section is also
all about the body so
chest front delts back biceps triceps
side delts rear delts everything
context usually on fridays
i would train around 9 30 a.m um so i
can avoid
rush hour at the gym and then i spend a
few hours when i come back working on a
phd so writing up
my introduction list review
whatever i need to do really
um but obviously today was a bit
different because i met my supervisors
and my colleague
oh yeah so this friday isn't like the
usual ones and i'm trading a bit earlier
than usual for my pm session because i
also want to avoid rush hour and my
session is quite long so
my outfit of the day as the cool could
say
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
do
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
set the whole accumulation phase of this
motorcycle
[Music]
[Music]
all right just walking myself home from
the gym now
finished my session
very happy to be done with this
motorcycle training
one of the hardest cycles i've been in a
while
just hard training combined with
low calories has not been fun
i do think you need to experience
contest at least once truly understand
what it's like i guess
so
yeah i'm happy to be done i'm going to
stop by
a grocery store or supermarket to get
some bread
yogurt and salad because i'm running low
and yeah then i'll head home and have a
meal
all right just got back
i got
two bags of
baby spinach
here we go
um
two 500 grams
of greek style zero percent fat natural
yard and then
some
[Music]
wholemeal bread i feel about 85 years
old right now doing this prep so
all right and now it's time for meal
for
technically for today which is my post
training meal from my pm session
here it is so a lot of borneos with a
lot of vegetables to keep me full
and half a kilogram of fat-free greek
yogurt
this is my best attempt at keeping me
full i could probably have more
vegetables than that but for now it does
a pretty good job
all right so i just got done with eating
the food
i also watched some anime i'm
a pretty big anime fan i used to be
really into anime and video games
but lately with phd work and
training and coaching and everything
i just haven't had much time to
watch anime or read manga
but i watched anime eat my food i'm
gonna take a shower and then i'm gonna
get some work done
all right fresh out the shower
and now
it's time for some work um typically i
organize my days in terms of
each day has one sort of main focus
so for example wednesdays and sundays or
my coaching days where i spend
usually
at least three hours on
client video calls um
updating guides writing programs
responding to messages more in depth
that sort of thing
then
tuesdays
thursdays and fridays so today's friday
are phd days where i spend at least
three hours on
phd work
um
whether that's writing stuff up
having meetings about phd
[Music]
just stuff like that and then
on
mondays
and
saturdays so monday is a meal prep day
and peachy day so i spend a few hours
doing meal prep but i also try and get
some phd work done
and then
saturdays are
um
social media days where i plan out my
youtube videos i plan out my
uh instagram content and i
edit everything voice over everything
upload it that sort of stuff so each day
has a sort of focus and today was a phd
day so i met up with my supervisors and
now i'm going to try and do some phd
work
um
but yeah that's how i like to structure
my days
all right it's 8 30 p.m and
i will end up getting some coaching like
them
and i am
utterly exhausted so i'm gonna take the
rest of the night off
read some
books
and then chill with a friend
usually i go to sleep around midnight so
that's the plan tonight as well have
around three hours or so
to relax and then head to bed have one
more meal before sleep and that's about
it so
