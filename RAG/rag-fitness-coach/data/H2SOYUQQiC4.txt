is healthy or can be healthy
sounds strange right indeed it is
so
it turns out obese and healthy at the
same time is a real category of people
there are actually obese people very
very many of them that are perfectly
healthy and research has confirmed that
tons of especially young obese people
have great blood work blood work you
can't tell apart from anyone else at any
size
so we're tempted to be like wow holy
crap it is really possible to be a peace
and health
problem
it does not last
when this research first came out
showing that lots of younger obese
people can be metabolically very healthy
it causes quite a stir and it should
because it required us to potentially
re-examine a lot of our assumptions
about the relationship between adiposity
and health
in humans the thing is shortly
thereafter
similar research came out
that
mere years later those same exact
metabolically healthy obese people
are no longer healthy at all
and
the thing is when you get people who are
not obese and they're metabolically
healthy
five or ten years later the average
person in that group is still
metabolically healthy
however
with the obese that were metabolically
healthy within five or ten years those
same people are predictably almost
always in much much worse health
so we could say well hold on a second
what happened and what happened is the
following
the behaviors particularly overeating
and under activity and eating the kind
of junk foods and stuff that make you
obese
the behaviors to make you obese and the
fat tissue itself because it all sorts
of nasty hormonal effects on your body
impose a chronic cumulative cost
to your body systems
and
that means if you're in a state of
obesity even if you're healthy now
there's an underlying degratory effect
on that health
so there's a cliff sliding down sort of
thing where if you're not obese and
you're healthy you just kind of
generally tend to do this for a long
time
when
health problems get bad with obese
people
they usually get real bad
because the system is already in a very
precarious state and when it starts to
slide in health a lot of times the rest
of it goes
if you happen to be obese and healthy if
you're watching this
now is the time
to think about starting to reduce your
level of obesity to lose some fat
so that you can stay healthy in the long
run because if you're obese in your
early 20s and then you get into some
pretty decent shape by your mid-20s you
may essentially almost never pay the
cost of your earlier obesity and it's
just like a fond memory you could look
oh i used to be real obese and the rest
of your life you're no longer obese and
you're super healthy and it lasts for a
long time
you don't want to wait until your health
starts to take a tumble
because when you start to slide into
unhealthy
she can get really tough to change
around
and that's when it becomes really really
bad news and that's when you start to
pay a long-term cost for this stuff
chronic lifespan
reduction can absolutely occur
from being obese
but most of the way that occurs is it
the obesity starts to harm you
before it starts to really harm you in
the few years that you have of being
young healthy and obese some young
people who are obese are never healthy
but some people are
that is the time to strike while the
iron is hot that is the time to get into
better shapes that you never have to pay
those costs
because if you're already unhealthy and
then you start to try to get no longer
obese to lose weight or lose fat that's
great
but it would have been much better if
you started a little bit earlier i know
it sounds preachy and all that shit but
it's just fucking true
lastly
there is this idea
that okay you're obese you're unhealthy
and you need to become a skinny mini to
be optimally healthy bullshit
if you lift weights especially if you
lift weights
because you don't have to lose a ton of
weight but you build a shitload of
muscle where you used to carry a lot of
fat weight now you carry a lot of muscle
weight instead
you eat well very healthy you increase
your physical activity and you eat a bit
less junk
and you go from being pretty fucking
overweight to significantly less
overweight you go from having very
little muscle which is metabolically
very healthy tissue to having a lot of
muscle
you go from having lots of fat too much
less fat
and you go from being obese to being
what i have termed scientifically
thickalicious
right
which means
you're not skinny as fuck you may even
be overweight on average but you have so
much muscle and you're so physically
active and you eat so well that you are
healthy as fuck
that means your health will be loads
better
than if you just eat junk food all the
time
and do nothing
but you
with that baseline of lifting weights
with that baseline of higher levels of
physical activity with most of your
foods being healthy foods
you can eat tons of fun foods have tons
of junk live a fucking awesome life not
have to restrictively diet all the
fucking time to be rail thinned you
don't have to do cocaine as a full-time
job like many skinny models do
apparently
because that itself is a whole crock of
bullshit
if you happen to be
considerably overweight and healthy
now is the time to make the change
i highly recommend it to start lifting
weights ease into it you got all the
time in the world
eating healthier being more active and
not even so much worried about the scale
but just getting the body fat levels to
come down significantly over the years
getting the muscularity to come up over
the years
you're going to be so much better off
that
it's going to be night and day an a very
good example of something like this
is the story of ethan sipley and if you
go to our channel number one video on
our channel the premiere video right on
our channel if you click on there it's
our most popular video everybody views
is the ethan sibley dieting journey
and ethan used to weigh like 530 pounds
that's a highly fucking extreme
now ethan weighs like in the 250 pound
to 270 pound range
he's not a skinny guy
right he's not like the guy who fucking
played napoleon dynamite okay
he's a thick motherfucker
but he's got so much muscle that he
doesn't even have a ton of body fat he's
got some body fat sure
but he's
50 trillion times healthier and can live
in a balanced state where he gets to eat
tons of food he's not chronically
starving all the time
what he did was he raised his level of
muscularity dropped his body fat changed
his behaviors and now he's in this
awesome middle path
of being way way fit and
still quite heavy
in the grand scheme
but one trillion times better off than
he was being
way way way fatter and inactive and
eating tons of junk
so yes the bs part of this video is that
being obese and inactive is healthy it's
not
but the silver lining to this video is
you don't have to become
a fucking real thin model
to get to 10 trillion times healthier
than used to be
lifting weights
eating healthier higher physical
activity
and
you are well on your way to way way
better outcomes and if you want to be
thinner aesthetically sweet that's
definitely possible
but if you just want to be
someone who lives their life and looks
good and feels great there are so many
correct answers of where you could end
up but all of them start with resistance
training healthy eating higher levels of
physical activity
do you want more advice on how to do
that shit that's a whole fucking channel
and companies about rp we got all the
answers tm because we don't have that's
just a trademark in any case folks let
me know what you think if you have any
follow-up questions we can always make
more videos attacking individual
subjects
thank you so much for tuning in and
we'll see you next time
you
