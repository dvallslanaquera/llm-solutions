hey folks
thursday p.m biceps
side slash rear delts and forearms
one exercise for each today we're going
to be illustrating how to use drop sets
in real life so we're going to do a drop
set for biceps drop set
for shoulders and it probably drops out
we'll see how it works
a lot of times drop sets are relatively
untenable for forums because
it actually takes so little time to
clear lactic that you can just do my
reps instead you don't have to drop the
load
so in any case that's what we're going
to be doing and let's go get pumped
[Music]
exercise number one cable bicep drop set
we're gonna start with something that is
between 10 and 20
of our rm and we're gonna drop
one notch on the cable stack every
single time we approach
close to failure we're gonna do that
four to six times
until the systemic fatigue is higher
than the local fatigue and we're no
longer getting
quality work put into the muscle
[Applause]
first set is going to be 10 to 20 reps
minimal rest between sets as long as it
takes charlie to switch it out for me
one notch down and then at least five
reps
something like five to ten hopefully uh
for all the subsequent sets
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
oh
come on
yes
[Music]
come on finish up strong one more last
one
[Music]
one more
go go go go go go go
[Music]
control
one two
[Music]
three
[Music]
five
seven last one
all right folks lateral raise on the
machine
another drop set crazy i know something
like 10 to 15 reps on the first set
and then about five reps five to ten on
every successive set
in drop sets the idea is not to go as
quickly as possible and rest as little
time as possible
it's to rest just as long as it takes to
make your muscle the limiting factor
again
which means you shouldn't be breathing
super heavy again you should feel your
mojo
you should feel your strength no more
lactate accumulated in the muscle
to the extent it interferes greatly with
contraction so you can still feel a
little burn
but you're ready to go do another
productive set of five to ten that's
when you go again
not just like right away because you
quickly do like one one one zero reps
and then you've ended your drop set for
no good reason
let's get number started
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
[Music]
folks you'll notice on lateral raises
we're going all the way up
slowly controlling down is this better
than just going to here no it's just a
different way of doing things
do you get a lot of side delt activation
from going higher you do
do you also get some front delt of
course you get a lot of trap of course
we're not using this as a side delt
isolation exercise necessarily
we're doing it to big big ass side delts
big ass traps and why not big ass front
belts as well
that's your goal it's overall shoulder
hypertrophy it's a great exercise
and a lot of people say well it's only
front delt because you're pointing up
this way
try it you will feel stimulus to fatigue
ratio wise you get a huge burn and pump
and tension
in your side delts doing it and if you
don't if you really only feel the front
delts stop fucking doing it it's that
simple folks everything comes down
to individualization at the end
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
uh
[Music]
uh
[Music]
oh
[Music]
oh
i didn't talk shit this time some of my
reps are sloppy as fuck
it's all the lactate in there this arm's
at least like 30 pounds
foreign curls because regular forearm
training if you know what i mean
doesn't always do a good enough job drop
set just like we've been doing for
biceps and delts
similar idea form curls you don't have
to wait too long because as soon as
lactic acid dissipates
usually you're centrally driven enough
to do another hard set
again first set is going to be 10 to 20
reps then successive sets of roughly
five to ten
again i'm doing six drop sets but all
volume landmarks a little different
charlie might do a little more
jarrod might do a little less if you do
this yourself make sure that you do the
appropriate amount of volume and scale
your volume as needed over time
to just do one number of sets and never
change let's get started
[Music]
wow
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
wow
[Music]
all right folks that's it for the
workout
biceps delts forearms
we're done workout posted in the
comments all the details
are sorry in the description see you
next time
for crazy psycho leg training like
session number two
friday am ouch
[Music]
you
