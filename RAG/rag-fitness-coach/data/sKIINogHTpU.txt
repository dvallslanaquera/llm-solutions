hey folks dr mike isrtel here for
renaissance periodization today's topic
is
how to spot a fad diet how you
can tell eh more times than not
than a diet that maybe your family has
said hey you ever heard about the dr
dickweed diet and you're like well it's
actually great you know shit like that
at parties and hangouts and just
scrolling the internet or maybe you're
interested in doing a diet and you're
like i wonder if there's any merit
good news is that a lot of the features
of the diet and especially how it's
presented
can tell you probabilistically of course
whether or not it has a high or low
probability of being a fad and thus
totally a waste of your time so
you know i count like at least eight
decent signs and certainly there are
more of if the diet you were looking at
is a fad
a lot of this applies to training as
well but that's just a very very easy
one to do so these are not in any order
of importance by the way all eight are
treated roughly equally
if you see any of these signs it doesn't
necessarily mean that you have a fat
diet on your hands but it means that
maybe you do more likely than not so
here's the first sign
exotic claims like
any diet that says you can drop like 50
pounds in a month
automatically you got to get your
skeptical eyebrow oh is that really true
now that may be true maybe they've
figured out something really crazy but
less likely than the fact that they're
just pedaling bullshit
every time you see really exotic claims
you gotta wonder now there's a bit of a
catch 22 there because
companies are trying to advertise their
best results the most exotic results
you know like it's just like dressing up
and brushing your hair for
you know school photo day you want to
look your best right diet companies want
to make sure they present their
their best have the best foot forward so
they tend to exaggerate sometimes or
just
fractionally put out their top hundred
best transformations or something which
is cool
but uh you know by exotic claims we
don't mean just like oh wow that's
really impressive but i see how that
could happen exotic usually means like
holy crap really like it strange the
imagination i remember i saw one
of those youtube ads that comes up
before a bunch of rp videos actually
uh it's like
oh this like
weird there's one change in like how
much water you drink you lose like 40
pounds in a month and it's like
what
i've been drinking the wrong water so
shit like that if it's a really exotic
claim if it seems too good to be true
often it is not always but oft
point number two sign number two of a
potential fad diet
is when the proponents of the diet
really minimize the level of effort you
are expected to bring to the equation
so you know say oh easy fat loss and
like barely any effort you know one of
those like um magazines they have in the
checkout the grocery store like
women's world or weekly world news
whatever like one page is like sasquatch
found the next patient like sasquatch
pronounced dad next page is like this
new gluten diet i'm saying you don't
have to try it all it just
you just get lean
here's the thing
is it possible for a diet to be
relatively low effort and
promote a really awesome result
not really dieting sucks that's kind of
one of these core pillars that you have
to understand that's part of becoming
wise in the diet space is you understand
that exotic claims are probably
exaggerated and realistic abilities of a
diet to change your
can be impressive but
you know normalized
and then the second thing you realize is
that anytime you're going to have to
lose fat or gain muscle you're gonna
have to work that doesn't mean you work
blindly until your fingers fall off
there can be easier ways to do things
certainly but if they minimize the
effort to a large extent like oh the
easiest diet you'll ever have you won't
even know you're dieting like really if
i'm supposed to expect really insane
results and the diet is easy as fuck is
this just like the first month of
advertising for a company that's such a
novel breakthrough that we'll all be
using it you know like imagine the first
iphone advertisements were like hey like
you have a fucking computer in your hand
you can talk to anyone too and it plays
videos it'll be like bullshit there's no
nothing like that that's like three
different devices and then it's real
you're like holy fuck
but uh you know
diet company fad diet companies don't
exactly have a research division with
like a 20 billion dollar r d budget
usually they're just well lying right so
if anyone says hey like easy fat loss
you got to be like
really and you want to know some details
again it's not a guarantee it's bullshit
but gee whiz you know if something's
gonna be really impressive but it's
really easy to get
why isn't everyone lean you know maybe
it's because they haven't found out
about this diet yet maybe
unlikely unlikely
next sign sign number three that your
diet you're looking at is a fad diet
is when it demonizes the establishment
doctors don't want you to know about
this new revolutionary fat loss formula
man those fucking doctors everything i
try to do in my life
stopped dead in my tracks by doctors i
was going 65 and a 55 fucking doctor
pulled me over he was like well the
american academy of sports physiologists
shut up
right damn doctors
and for some reason they don't want you
to know
about this incredible fat loss pill
because you see they're in the pockets
of big pharma
even though doctors are not directly
incentivized to prescribe you
medications and
if this pill worked they would just
prescribe me the fucking pill or they
would just tell you hey like there's
this pill
go try this pill
right it works
but when you have to say
the establishment sucks it means maybe
you were not accepted to the
establishment because by its
conventional methodologies of testing
and verification maybe your diet sucks
or doesn't actually work and also
they play on this thing by demonizing
the establishment and
oftentimes making doctors or personal
trainers out there they don't want you
know the secret
it um really pulls on our heartstrings
of our combativeness
um humans like a certain bit of conflict
and they like to kind of watch conflict
that's why we watch sports and it's very
interesting so when they say well this
is these doctors and this fucking this
mega diet company that's good and
providing this great fat loss these
doctors are evil you're like whoa cool
i want to try it and if it's good enough
to ban or if doctors are super busy and
they're super loaded they take time out
of their busy schedules to demonize this
thing and maybe it's really got
something to it but it's a very easy
rhetorical device
a lot of times when they say doctors
don't want you to know there's two
reasons for that one they just made it
up doctors don't give a fuck like hey
doc you know what's the why are you
suppressing evidence about the
ultra lean 1000 protocol they're gonna
be like what
i don't know what the fuck that is
or
they do know what it is and they're like
it's bullshit
because
it's bullshit and they're right now of
course sometimes doctors poo-poo things
that actually do work and sometimes it's
for their own vicious self-interests but
again unlikely
the average fat out of every 100
potential fad diets maybe one of them is
really actually pretty good and doctors
poo poo it for no reason that does
happen
number four
demonizing entire food groups
here's the cool thing about dieting
as a scientific field dieting is uh
pretty well understood at this point not
completely well understood not very well
understood just pretty well
and we have some pillars some basics
that we know that have so much evidence
in favor of them and so little against
that is probably getting somewhere close
to the real truth of the universe and
one of those pillars is that
specific foods are almost never the
cause of excess body fat
and
food groups like carbs or proteins or
fats or veggies or grains definitely
grains are almost never the cause nor is
the removal the solution of any kind of
grand health or appearance change that
you want on your body
so
if a diet's like look carbs are the
enemy and you got to get rid of them you
got to be like fuck man really it's all
these like ultra marathon runners and
just healthy people that are like vegan
and yoga and shit and they shell out of
carbs all the time they're lean and they
seem happy
it even appears that they um they often
have sex you can tell on their faces
they had this glow
it's the opposite of my face figure that
one out so
if we know from a scientific perspective
that
demonizing
food groups is just probably not
pointing to the truth if a diet fad or
sorry if a diet you're looking at
maybe as a fat if it's doing that's bad
news bad news which automatically makes
a carnivore diet a fad diet
any kind of keto diet fat diet
to ah
large extent many approaches to veganism
are fattish
you know animal protein's bad for you
like really how bad that gets the worst
in the meta-analyses say it's barely bad
at all and potentially in a
the context of a well-balanced diet not
bad at all like nonsense nonsense
animals are bad for you like just say
they're bad for the environment that's
already true just say it's unethical to
eat them that's super true i gotta have
that one thing it's gotta be bad for you
too and that's unfortunately sometimes
puts them in the fat category
next number five reason that your diet
could be fetish
is the one ingredient cause
one fucking thing your whole diet's
great
even though you you know iv inject pizza
on the weekends ah who cares you're
human
the real cause if you're being a fat
piece of shit
is gluten
you see the gluten molecules
they go in the blood
and
then you get fat that's just how it
happens i'm not a scientist i don't know
but i swear those doctors are trying to
keep something from us and it's fucking
gluten right
this could be elimination or inclusion
so the inclusion of gluten in your diet
is making you fat if a diet company says
that and they're trying to sell you
their own diet free from gluten of
course as any responsible diet would be
you got to be skeptical about that what
the fuck really really one fucking thing
it doesn't have to be gluten it'd be 10
trillion other things
and they come in their own fad waves and
companies will latch onto them
a couple months back i was getting a lot
of questions no but nobody ever reached
out to me i'm making this up about uh
you guys probably remember this
anti-nutrients
like there are components
uh like found in rice and pasta that can
interfere at high concentrations with
the absorptions of the nutrients in rice
and pasta sure that's the real big
problem in the world it's people getting
fat because they're not absorbing enough
nutrients i thought it was backwards but
who cares anti-nutrients for a while the
fucking cause of every problem just one
thing so you take like a trucker who
eats like fucking beef jerky and ho hoes
you guys amazing amazing no no judging
truckers making a fine decision
you know pepsi ho ho's beef jerky slice
of pizza hot dog repeat
if you just take antinutrients out of
the motherfucker's diet he's gonna be
like
scott the video guy what's a good uh
it's a good physical role model for
hollywood
thor
thor fucking thor with his biceps and
those abs oh in the uh the lower abs
where the
from where he does the sex to people i
love that muscle
and uh yeah it's just what data and the
trucker's gonna be like i can't fucking
believe it i was poisoning myself with
anti-nutrients and they were through a
series of as yet undetermined steps
making me fat
this is not how it fucking works
what makes you fat
eating too many calories
usually through a variety of junk foods
which make eating too many calories easy
i know it sounds fucking crazy
it's not gluten okay why isn't it gluten
well we actually know that they've
studied the series of studies about five
to ten years ago where the gluten craze
was getting really crazy and everyone
was gluten intolerant then they did
blinded studies where they told people
like hey you're gluten intolerant right
they're like yeah like well here's this
thing it doesn't have any gluten in it
you should eat it it'll be great they
eat it and they watch them for like
three hours and like any gi just for us
like no it was great like okay guess
what that thing was made of fucking 50
gluten and they're like no
and they probably walk out of the office
like fuck
fuck was i lying to myself i could eat
pizza right a lot of times people be
like oh man i'm really bloated from all
this gluten i'm eating and it's like how
are you getting your gluten they're like
well the cheesy breadsticks from little
caesars how the fuck else are you
supposed to giggle like
how many of those did you have like
you know i don't really count them
90 maybe 80 something not 90 80
something 80 something 500 calorie
sticks
per night yeah that'll get you bloated
it's not the fucking gluten
inclusion is also a thing
so a lot of greens companies now here's
the thing powdered greens are fucking
sweet they help you get some vitamins
and minerals
they're fine
but they're not exactly the fucking
solution to all your health problems
they're sure as hell not going to make
you magically lean
like again you look at someone who's
like jabba the hutt style physique and
you're like oh
and you're like
greens do you want greens and they're
like
naughty greens or joe han solo and they
eat the greens and
they're just shredded to bits like no no
they just give you a couple vitamins and
minerals and sometimes not even so well
you'll be the same level of fat just
with more vitamins and minerals so a lot
of times if there's a secret ingredient
that claims to revolutionize everything
or we found the one thing that in your
diet that we remove everything sort of
comes together and you get super lean
real big signs of bullshit so definitely
watch out for those
number six this one hits personally
close to home
the genius inventor claim you know like
this one lone scientist invented this
solution to fat loss and usually a
couple of these layered on one lone
scientist and the doctors and personal
trainers
hate him
because he's
cracked the code to fat loss which i'm
skipping ahead that's our next file so
we'll talk about that in a sec so the
genius adventure thing is kind of
interesting
because
most effective products really kind of
tend to sell themselves
like yeah whatever i designed the rp
diet app
you know you don't really hear me saying
that much because the fucking app works
by itself but it tells you to eat less
healthy food over time and you get lean
that's how it works by the way
so you know there's no need to go
parading my dumb ass around if you're
like don't bring them phd solve the
fucking fat boss i didn't do any that
shit cause the product works on its own
and if you have to wonder if the product
doesn't work on its own then how do you
bolster the product and bolster sales
you gotta have an angle and one of the
angles is the genius inventor
like you know fundamentally why are so
many teslas being purchased
i tell you what man
elon musk's fucking great huge fan huge
man
i'm not paying 70 000 fucking dollars
because i'm a fan of some motherfucker
unless there's you know
i don't know if we'll get banned for
this sexual favors involved
then maybe you know 70 000. that's a
that's a high volume of favors so to
speak but in any case like i'm not
buying a fucking tesla because elon musk
is the man even though he is i'm gonna
need that motherfucker to work well
you'll notice well first of all tesla
doesn't really do any advertising but
any of their
like shit that you see like the company
logo on buildings and a variety of other
media outlets they have and just
physically their cars like elon musk
faces and on that shit it's just fucking
tesla's a fucking tee that's it it's
like why would you buy one because it's
fucking sweet it's electric and it's
fast in every other car the charger is
great or whatever
as you can tell i'm an enormous tesla
fan it's fine car it's great car so
the genius of venice thing you gotta
wonder if they really talk shit about
how fucking genius the inventor is
maybe the product isn't this good now
maybe maybe again all of these
standalone could be making an amazing
product that's totally worth your time
but if you check enough of these boxes
you start to wonder fuck man am i being
lied to and uh yeah genius inventor or
especially really over leveraged
especially exaggerated
like you know if we went like dr mike
the most brilliant man in the world like
they'll say shit like that with fat loss
diets like this one guy like
rediscovered physics like fuck
which brings me to the next point number
seven
the code crack fallacy
is a general idea
that
what is keeping you
from what you want
to be lean
from currently is keeping you from what
you want
and keeping you in a state of what you
currently are what is
you know fatter than you'd like to be
is
some kind of puzzle
where one little tweak
boop
and the whole fucking code opens up and
now it's easy free living to be as lean
as you want this is very very common
just three simple foods that when you
eat them in the right fucking
proportions you'll be leaner than back
in
a greyhound
interesting ad if that was ever made so
the thing is is that a lot of times you
know we in hard problems
we kind of tend to know
what the general solution looks like but
all of the vectors towards the answer
require quite a bit of work or
organizational effort you know like uh
they're launching like fucking rockets
to space again elon musk
you know it's not like they're like oh
man as soon as we found how the fucking
flux capacitor works the fucking rockets
were easy like no it's 50 trillion
engineering problems at every turn
fucking hard
and
the reason they the closest you come to
the code crack fallacy being real in
diets and fat loss is like
i learned how to count calories one easy
trick i'm fucking lean like yeah it's a
trick all right it's not that easy it's
not just you solve the puzzle piece shit
goes into place you're like fuck i have
to solve this puzzle every day
lucky i have my rp diet app to do it
with
buy one i need a lambo another lambo of
course i have 18 already
so
be careful
when you're presented with like oh like
what diet you know science doesn't know
is that this specific collagen protein
or fucking oh man there was this one a
few years back bone broth fuck
if you just had bone broth it would link
everything together and fucking fix your
ass up get the fuck out of here
get the fuck out of here number eight
this is actually the biggest one
i saved the best for last
violates fundamentals of physiology
like when people say it doesn't matter
how much food you eat i've actually seen
that in a magazine eat anything you want
lose like 10 pounds a week anything i
want
they didn't specify in what quantity i
suppose we could let them slip out on
that one but a lot of times people will
straight violate the fundamentals like
thermodynamics never loses it never
loses but
it has never lost maybe in the future it
will lose maybe you'll be the first to
discover how it does so
but until that happens you can't eat 10
pizzas a day and lose weight
sorry a lot of diets will claim that oh
like you don't have to count calories at
all don't worry about xyz and it's like
fuck man i thought that was like the
core of dieting like nah bullshit well
maybe
maybe that'd be really nice to just eat
whatever
violate the laws of thermodynamics and
somehow still come out super lean but
it's unlikely
so
all of these together
are very powerful i'll tell you this if
you have a diet that checks all these
boxes don't buy it tell your family
that's really excited about your friends
not to buy it
if it checks one or two of these
may be worth a bit of a closer look
because sometimes yeah like some really
good diets do check a few of these and
you know like
they actually turn out to work quite
well
not likely but possible
folks
what have i missed
what other signs
in diet and training in any kind of
advertising presentation
are when you look at are you like
[Music]
sounds like bullshit throw some in the
comments
give us a like
you know what i'm saying youtube shit
give us a sub if you haven't subbed
already and if you've subbed already
sub again it's not how it works is it
folks
stay true stay loving stay pure namaste
see you next time
