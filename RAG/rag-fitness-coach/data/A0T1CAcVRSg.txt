amazing welcome to Renaissance
periodization
[Music]
all right let's slide a little closer
together all right like you love each
other all right come on Mike Folks I'm
Dr Mike for Renaissance priorization
this is my biological son Jared fether
ifb Pro and it's a family event today
because we have Mr Joe Sullivan and Miss
Hunter Henderson and there actually
people don't know this obvious lie that
they're brother and sister born in the
same and raised in the same home but
there's a problem in that home beautiful
home wonderful suburban American
upbringing they just never got along
you it was hatred and the reason the
both so jacked is they started training
so they could feel each other but
there's just been this situation where
kind of mutually assured destruction
like China versus the us today we are
going to let it fly it's a battle of
sexes right now go in the comments and
type in who your favorite sex is is it
men is it is it is it males is it female
or is it undecided or some in
between you let us know it's going to be
a crazy leg workout head Head to Head
guys they're laughing right now this is
all fake theying can't stand each other
the type of I heard before I'll
fill you in on between stops let's go
get this
done all right folks the first exercise
that Hunter and Joe are going to do is
the Smith machine lean suede situation
it'll come up on the card what we call
it in the app this is an exercise I
learned from Mr Trevor Fulbright the
king of f RAM and uh Mr Mano henselman
has also demonstrated it before you put
your feet nice and far in front of that
bar and the bar should go underneath
your hips probably 2 or 3 inches between
the hip crease and the bar give yourself
some room what you're going to do is
you're going to hip hinge Over the Bar
you're not going to round your back ever
you're going to point your tummy out
chest up and go all the way into that
hip hinge position your knees are fully
locked out the entire time this is a
massive exposure of the hamstrings in a
stretch as long as you keep that back
arched
keep your feet popped nice and forward
go down nice and slow your first time
doing this you might want to pull to
crawl down I've been known to crawl up
and down a few poles if you know what I
mean
he sorry wrong job go slow this gets
real tough and because our body is
positioned vertically here and
horizontally at the very bottom we're
going to expose the hamstrings to the
most tension under the most stretch so
not only is the most difficult down
there but it's also growth promoting
another big benefit there's no axial
fatigue you're not stiffle a deadlift
anything it's just your body leveraged
to maximum advantage to toast your
hamstrings couple sets of 5 to 10 here
these guys hamstrings will be but their
glutes their quads their spinal erector
mechanisms are going to be saved for the
hack Squad which is how we're going to
try to kill them after this let's get it
done good that's it good enough how's
that feel that is something yeah good
good this looks gross I haven't done
these in Forever
be very careful I pulled my hamstring
doing this nice good
excellent big chest the whole time
especially at the
bottom feel your hands
[Music]
mhm good and back up push your hips push
your hips in closer to the bar you want
to be flushed to the thing okay pretend
you have aing strap on on and there's a
pathetic guy's right here go
ahead push your hips through
yes Arch that back big chest big chest
big chest big chest I hold the alltime
world record uh squat in the 100 kilo
weight class that's 220 lb with a I
can't remember the kilo conversion but
it's 850.000
big chest let's get this working set
going very
[Music]
good good one more deep slow gentle
touch cast
up
yeah oh yeah Jo good woo buddy
[Music]
expose those
hamstrings yeah and then all the way up
excellent in sleeves I hold the alltime
world record in the 181 class uh 589 lbs
and then in wraps I have the third
heaviest squat in the world for a woman
672 lb
my bench is
369 and my best deadlift is
572 so pretty
strong Joe last Q hips open a little bit
just a little
bit knees out knees out knees out hold
that deep stretch knees out oh there you
go
Beautiful Joe yeah man yeah feel those
hams two more two more big chest put
that shitty attention on him let's go
open yeah finish there you
go think they'll get sore oh yeah that's
they they're going to be that's very
very productive exercise right there you
like that Q oh it's yeah it's like less
like knees I just need to think external
rotation yeah out as like a a somebody
yeah exactly I know I knew what you
meant though I do usually I say hips
open yeah and people are like yeah like
what do I yeah I
know I can use terminology with you I
always forget no it's I always I always
like it that makes more sense you know
chest chest good I want you to go even
deeper a little bit lower really milk it
at the bottom so Hunter you got
this chest up I know you're strong
enough to do it those are 4
that's it beautiful
work so when the knee SS super tight it
helps it slide over your
skin suit slippers mhm slides right up
let's get some let's get some manosphere
 in here I'm going tell you
something you can tell me if you agree
with it or not mhm first God made man
agreed and then maybe a woman was made
who cares it's byproduct of a man it was
Adam's Rib thank you Adam this is a
man's world yes amaz that's all I need
to
hear Scott the video guy a known
misogynist says you can't spell woman
without man and that's true that's true
ladies take note second place let's go
confirm with Hunter see if that's true
all men any man every man is stronger
than every other woman ever period I'm a
man I'm stronger than you by my
Birthright
no cuz I am stronger than in the men in
this room I'm stronger than 95% of them
and we're going to find out if you're
stronger than Joe shortly cuz I even
even that might be true she's ungodly
strong on the hack Squad I'm not I'm not
I'm not happy about this all right we'll
see we'll see I'm back in my Jewish RS
we can lay bets we can make money
so you notice when most people set up
for a hack squat they try to set up
especially if they're powerlifters
exactly how they're squatting so they
try to transfer a squatting pattern over
to the hack squat what we say many and
often times on this channel is we're
training a Target muscle we're training
for hypertrophy here this is much
different than training to move a
specific exercise with all of your
musculature so when you're power liting
you're training the squat you're
training the deadlift you're training
the bench press when you're training for
power for like bodybuilding for
hypertrophy training you're not training
the bench you're training the pecs the
triceps and the front dels and you're
trying to emphasize certain things
during each movement so you might do
flies to EMP emphasize the pecs you
might do skulls to emphasize the triceps
you can still bench and emphasize the
PCS as well with certain queuing so here
on the hack spot we're not training the
hack spot if you just kind of had no
idea what this machine did you could
kind of think of it as okay I'm trying
to Target my quad as best as possible
this is the machine I'm using but it's a
quad exercise so what I did with Hunter
especially since she's she's actually a
pretty wide squatter she doesn't want to
do this she doesn't want to put her
feet in she doesn't want to point the
toes out and expose the quads in that
deep position but we're going to make
them both do that today so think about
that think about the difference there
when you're training for hypertrophy
you're training to expose the muscle to
the stimulus when you're training for
strength you're trying to move your
entire body as one unit to get as much
load as possible talk some to each
other you
wow wow that was uh instantly aggressive
maybe if we plug in some footage of her
old uh her most previous meat we could
uh see what's going to happen here cuz I
I I don't I don't recall I don't recall
missing squat bit I think you're the
only one who's been uh been making that
a habit so uh all I see is that we're at
the same weight I've literally Trea that
as a warm-up weight I'm cool with six
I'll go to six right now you want me to
go to Six all right you you you cool
with that we'll go six go six go six
then there we go

amazing welcome to Renaissance
periodization
okay Joe let's get in here yeah I'm cool
let me get some water yeah yeah yeah
probably going to puke but
whatever the reason she's doing one more
is because she hasn't been training this
way for very long Joe's actually
transitioning to where he's going to try
for a bodybuilding show soon he's been
training high volume for like two or
three months already Joe is going to do
one more set this is auto regulation at
its finest I tend to be the voice reason
on the channel Mike will probably have
to do three more
sets so Joe one more set he's used to
the higher volume she's going to go to
lunges next so they're going to meet
back up at lunges let's get
done again No Rest slow slow there slow
slow
there and one more rest a little bit
we'll do another set of two and you're
done every inch is yours
go down slow slow last rep here big
moves up lock it lock it J
bro holy ball sack dude that was great
yep that was
good take your time guys take your
time stop stay with the children
[Music]
people know Jared and I as lifters right
but Jared and I are kind of chefs we in
the kitchen cook we cooked up a little
something nasty for these two fine folks
here they look like they're doing just
fine to
me one set and then a bonus round pick
up these dumbbells these are lunges that
just have a few rules they're not
focused on the glutes they're total
gluten quad all around we want pressure
on front and back foot the only rules
are is slow
descent staying upright the entire time
none of this and a gentle touch of
the knee to the ground every single time
and then step Jared and I are going to
be right in front of both of them we're
going to have them lock step one step
one step one step all the way through
when both of them have returned they'll
Place their weights
here when they've come back they're
going to come up on these plates all the
way
up the rule here is close stance and the
knees go forward you have an upright
body posture it is basically a Cy squat
knees come forward one second at the
bottom and then at the top full
lockout slow to set no none of
this and then up I'm going to be calling
every step I say step you step
yep nice long steps try to keep up with
each other
okay
step
step let's go y good got it y got it
grip okay giv out a little out drop them
drop
them just body weight
step and that's it switch sides slowy
Centric every rep on my call when I say
down you do a rep slow and a pause at
the bottom
begin hell yeah fellas hell yeah that's
how we're getting it done today up
