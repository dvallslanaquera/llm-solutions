folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization and today i
want to switch gears
and talk about eternal salvation
what's going to happen to your soul when
you die
or we could talk about rep ranges and
the different stuff
every single rep range does let's go
with our ranges and maybe later
we'll talk about when you're going to
hell that's right
because you watch this channel you're
probably going to hell check this out
there are a bunch of different reps we
can do when we're in the gym
to get a bunch of different kinds of
results
what i have done in this video is i've
split up the reps into
just a variety of ranges that don't
overlap
and thus we can talk about each range
specifically and see
so like what each range is best suited
for
what each range is like okay for and
probably what each range
is just not ideal for we have
six ranges here they are sets of one to
three reps
sets of three to six reps i just said it
wasn't overlapping i lied
barely overlapping sets of 5 to 10 reps
sets of 10 to 20 reps sets of 20 to 30
reps and then sets of 30 reps
plus now the big caveat here
to get the most out of this discussion
just have to remember two things or
one really that this is talking about
working sets that are hard sets close to
failure which means
for sets of under 10 reps we're talking
about
rpes rating of perceived exertion of
seven or above
and for uh you know sets of usually five
reps and above especially ten reps and
above
rirs reps in reserve how many reps you
have until you go to failure of
at most three so like three two one or
zero right
so these are all hard sets if we're
doing them
we all obviously we manage the load the
heavier loads get us into the lower rep
ranges
the lighter loads get us into the higher
rep ranges let's figure out what all
these rep ranges
are more ideally suited to decent at
and then maybe not so great at you guys
can use this information to build your
own training programs modify your
programs
so that you know you know what you want
out of a program you can arrange the
training
uh rep ranges in such a way that you get
more of what you want
and less of what you don't want so
here's the deal
sets of 1 2 3 repetitions
they are great to develop specific
peaking strength to show off your
maximum force production
your 1rm training with heavy sets of one
to three
is the best thing for in the short term
really developing a run repetition max
to show it off
it's not to say we build strength really
well with these which we do we'll get to
that in a sec
but it's really sort of the last maybe
four to eight weeks of a program if you
do a lot of singles doubles and triples
you really get good at showing off your
one rep max or going super super heavy
right because there's a specificity
there when you have ultra heavy loads
it's a very specific condition
and sets of one to three reps let you
practice in that specific condition for
example
if you walk out a set of like six on the
squat like that's
heavy like a hard set of six rp9 or
something that's heavy as shit
but even with the setup you can set up
like 90
well like not really retracting your
shit not really pushing your elbows down
and you can still like sort of hack it
out grind it out because it's not
that heavy sets of one to three heavy
your setup has to be almost ideal
otherwise if you try to lift it out of
the rocket like
something's wrong right so it teaches
you
and your walk back like with sets of six
you can take two steps back and then
adjust your feed and you're okay
with sets of one to three you might only
have two total steps until you start
pissing your
pants so you might wanna really practice
your walk out okay i'm gonna put my foot
back
okay just here and then put my foot back
there okay i know i'm going
my knees are out i'm staring up you also
learn not to waste a lot of time under
the bar because as soon as that heavy
load is on you
it changes things because the load is so
much greater than your body weight if
you're really strong or just a higher
percent
of your body weight no matter how strong
you are your center of gravity is a
little bit different with a one to three
rm load
than it is with like a six round load or
something like that so it changes things
you
there's no shortage of benefit for
practicing that
and there's no way you can get that
maximum performance ultra-heavy weights
without having
really really experienced it just like
you know you can train a variety of
martial arts and do a lot of jiu jitsu
and boxing drills and stuff like that
but if you're training for an mma fight
at some point in training you have to be
hit in the face
with a person who wants to hurt you
because if your first exposure is in
that ring
holy shit all your plans are going to be
like oh my god what's going on but if
you've been there before
you can really develop at least a
psychological
utility to be like okay i know where i
am i'm not going to freak out
so really really big thing here it's
such a big benefit that it's nearly
mandatory for any kind of like
really decent attempt at doing well in
powerlifting and weightlifting
like if you're a weightlifter or a
powerlifter you want to do a competition
to really show off how strong you really
are
if you never do singles doubles and
triples that's a one to three
you're not really doing your best to
show off right it would be a really bad
deal now
that's what they're ideal for sets of
one to three are okay for general
strength gains
you can do them kind of all the time you
can and they make you generally stronger
like your strength builds over time
however it doesn't maximize your
strength for one simple reason
it's such low repetitions per set that
the stimulus to the muscle
is relatively low that gets stronger
signal isn't that high
because you're just not under the bar
for very long the force transduction is
amazing
but it like turns on for a bit and then
turns off and your muscles are like yeah
i guess we got kind of a message to get
stronger but it wasn't that big of a
message
and you can say well why don't we just
do more of those sets like 10 sets of 2
or something you can
but while the stimulus is decent but not
amazing for strength enhancement
the fatigue is really high because
crushingly heavy loads
especially the psychology needed to get
under them like you got to rev up a
little bit to do heavy doubles
that makes the fatigue really high so if
you take you know once that causes this
much fatigue
if you start layering on four five six
sets the needed volume to maximize
strength adaptations your fatigue is
going to be
crazy crazy high and thus not the
optimal way to do things so if you want
the best basic strength which we'll get
to in just a bit
maybe sets of like three to six are a
little bit better than one to three
because of the really high fatigue
component per volume of the sets of one
to three so it's a fine way to get
stronger
but it's almost like um if you're really
hungry
it's like eating uh like breakfast
cereal with like this teeny tiny little
spoon where you got
one cheerio on the spoon at a time like
at some point like can i just fucking
get a bigger spoon because i'm really
hungry i want a lot of cheerios
same idea with doing singles and doubles
and triples for
enough volume for strength training it's
like can i just do a set of six here and
it's still really heavy and it'll be
good for me and that's absolutely
correct
now sets of one to three are great for
peaking
they're decent for general strength
they're not ideal for hypertrophy
because that whole volume stimulus to
fatigue ratio problem
multiplies many fold the if you had to
get your hypertrophy volume
from sets of one to three holy shit
you might do like eights i don't even
know man
you might realistically do like 15 to 20
sets of heavy doubles
to get enough volume to get your quads
to grow as well as they would
from like six to eight sets of
tennis reps right have you ever done a
workout of 20 doubles
like actual heavy hard trying doubles
that's nuts
your fatigue i don't know if a lot of
people can finish a workout like that at
actual heavy loads
at some point it's just junk volume and
even if it's not junk falling the fate
contribution's
fucking insane you may never walk out of
that gym and if you do you may not come
back for two weeks at any decent
performance so
it's just untenable for hypertrophy at
its best now will you still grow some
muscle
totally some muscle decent muscle and
maximum muscle
are two very or three very different
things decent muscle fine but it doesn't
even do that
it grows meh muscle and that's probably
not what you want so if you want to be
your most
jacked now the sets of one to three are
probably not your best bet
because those stimulus to fatigue ratios
are terrible and here's another one
stimulus to time ratio is terrible and
if you're curious about these terms the
hypertrophy book
uh that uh that i co-authored is a great
resource
stimulus-to-time ratio is basically like
how good of a workout can you get in how
short of a time
can you imagine how long a workout takes
where you
properly do 20 sets of doubles
in the squat for example properly means
you gotta rest two or three minutes
between each set
and doubles wear you out i mean oh my
god
you're in there and you're like finally
i got all my work in and someone's like
dude it's been three and a half hours
what did you do like
old hamstrings quads calves adductors
you're like
yeah just quads like oh my god like are
you nuts this is the least efficient way
to train
and it's not very effective if you're
like true but i get to train heavy which
is sweet because
i get to feel like i'm a t-rex or
whatever who knows right
not a great idea sets of one to three
reps are really really awesome at
peaking your strength
not so great at everything else moving
along
we take weight off the bar things become
lighter now we can do
hard sets of three to six repetitions
all right there's some overlap there no
big deal
best use of 36 reps is developing what's
called basic strength
the underlying ability of the muscle to
produce force
if we want to show off that ability a
ton we have to put the icing on the cake
and do sets of one to three for at least
a few weeks
but to get that cake bigger to get that
ability to lift heavy weight higher
we need some combination of a decent
volume and decent load
and sets of three to six reps get all of
that for us which is really awesome they
let you train heavy
but with enough volume to drive maximum
adaptations and the fatigue isn't crazy
excessive it's an
awesome balance thus it drives strength
the most now
it's okay for peaking strength so if you
want to do a powerlifting meat but you
don't want to peek for it but you still
want to kind of show off a little bit
it's totally fine if you do heavy
triples and heavy sets of four and five
you're not going to be like a complete
alien on a power lifting platform
weightlifting platform you'll do okay
not your best if you had done singles
and doubles but you'll do just fine
it's not heavy enough to really get you
clued into that ultimate heavy loads
that you're going to be lifting in
competition
now sets of three to six reps are also
much better for hypertrophy
than sets of one to three so they're
actually okay for hypertrophy you'll
build lots of muscle size this way
especially if you're a beginner you're
not a hard gainer so on and so forth
but remember hypertrophy one of the
biggest drivers is
training volume and getting enough
volume with sets of three to six
because the stimulus to fatigue ratio
isn't that great it's better than sets
of one to three but not amazing
you end up having the situation where if
you want to get to the requisite volumes
with sets of three to six you're just
going to be much more beat up
on the tail end there's a great uh study
from maybe five years ago
by dr brad schoenfeld where they they
compared like three sets of ten
with i think seven sets of three and
they showed that both people got the
same amount of hypertrophy
notice the same amount of hypertrophy to
do seven sets of three
to match three sets of ten and when they
interviewed both groups at various times
the three by ten group and the seven by
three group they all pretty much said
the same thing
which was like the three by ten group
was usually like yeah this is
easy i could like do you guys want me to
do more sets and they're like no no stop
it's just three and i'm like all right i
feel fine they were recovering super
fast
and then the 7x3 group the heavy
training group
who tried to do hypertrophy training in
the three to six range
they were like please for the love of
god get me out of here i can't do this
anymore
i'm so messed up so tired my joints are
messed
up everything's dying i can't do this
anymore so they were ultra fatigued
not the best most sustainable way to do
it right
now that's what the
sets of three to six are okay for okay
for hypertrophy and okay for strength
right oh sorry okay for peaking strength
and okay for hypertrophy
what are they not great for well if you
want to maximize either peaking strength
or hypertrophy
these are not ideal for okay so that's a
three to six because there's a
difference
just in your mind about maximization
versus things that work
right sometimes you want sort of the
very best
and the very best effort and just things
that work
aren't good enough anymore like if
you're training usain bolt to win the
olympics and sprinting
you're not going to be like yeah like do
some kind of sprint program you'll be
fine you have great genetics like
great genetics will take him to the
olympics but he has to have a real good
program to win the olympics so if you're
his coach you're probably you know
maybe like just a program's not good
enough we want the best
so if you want the best possible
strength outcomes for peaking strength
you have to win this next powerlifting
or do your best or you have to for
example
be the best bodybuilder you can be and
just really get as much muscle growth as
possible
you're probably not going to want to
stick to three to six reps all the time
because it's never going to give you the
best of both worlds
this is the case especially with
advanced lifters beginners
can get excellent peaking strength
abilities and excellent hypertrophy from
sets of three to six because beginners
are easy they adapt really fast they
adapt very generally
when you get more advanced that stuff
doesn't work as well anymore you have to
get more specific for what you want
this is why something like starting
starting strength five by five like do
your fives or i don't know i can't do
that impression that let well
texas man so this is why five by five
and stuff like that three by five is
really great for beginners just to make
them better at well everything really
it's not the most ideal thing for folks
that are more advanced at that point we
have to bifurcate in a variety of other
ways
and one of those ways is perhaps by
doing sets of five to ten repetitions
that's our next repetition range
its best uses is that it develops
hypertrophy
really well general muscle growth great
if you're saying
you want to grow muscle and you show me
your program and you're doing sets of
five to ten i'm never gonna be like
that's stupid like that's awesome right
on
and it's especially the case with large
amplitude movements that take a lot of
time to execute
like a squat uh versus like a calf raise
in which one rep
happens in like a fraction of a second
right and it's not enough time
spent stimulating tension if you guys
are interested in that topic we have an
older video
one of our very good ones of when i
address time under tensions just type in
israel
time under tension and you'll get a
great video describing the amplitude
stuff going on
basically large amplitude movements
movements in which the bar takes a long
time to move
uh sets of five to ten reps are great
and nearly ideal for hypertrophy and
probably for uh faster twitch fibers now
the
current state of the literature as i
record this
it's not very convincing that fiber-type
hypertrophy is a thing
there are some hints that maybe it's a
thing especially in extreme cases
especially for advanced individuals
so it's not very clear to super heavy
lifting for sure
uh prioritizes the faster switch fibers
and the super light lifting for sure
prioritizes the slower twitch fibers it
could be a little bit more
complex than that and maybe just not
clear we're going to operate under that
general assumption for the rest of this
lecture
but in your mind i would heavily caveat
it as being like this rep range stuff
for fiber types specifically might not
pan out all that great so
keep a skeptical light of course
everything i say and everything anyone
else says
but especially to this right now so uh
it has been reported that like you know
uh faster twitch
individuals former sprinters things like
that really explosive people they get a
lot of hypertrophy benefit and that's
occurred in my coaching of many people
as well
uh i've coached tons of athletes before
they generally explosive fast twitch
dominant athletes really respond well to
hypertrophy in the 5 to 10 rep range
if you start pushing steps of 15 and 20
on them a lot of times that kind of jack
shit happens to just kind of get tired
so at least from my personal experience
whatever dog shit that's worth
um maybe give that some thought right
sets of 5 to 10 reps are great for
general hypertrophy especially
potentially a faster touch muscle fibers
and they're also really awesome
for letting you develop your technique
why sets of five to ten reps
aren't so heavy that they crush you and
you can't do the technique like you
don't teach someone how to squat
with singles they're heavy singles
because they just have one rep to
practice and then
they fuck it up like oh sorry you're
done and they will fuck it up because
it's so heavy they're like freak out
right so
sets of five to ten not so heavy that
people freak out they can maintain good
technique
and at the same time it's not enough
reps to degrade technique
because if you try to teach technique
with sets of like 20 then by set number
or by rep number 12 or 15 the people are
just trying to
get through it and their technique goes
to hell because the burn is happening
they get tired they get bored
so that's a 5 to 10 of that awesome kind
of middle range where it's just enough
uh repetition practice to get them a
really good training
and it's not so much repetitive and it's
just enough load to get them to feel the
load but not so much load that it
crushes their technique
and it doesn't tire them out so it
doesn't degrade their technique so a lot
of times when you teach technique to
beginners
it'll be in sets of five to ten which is
really really awesome now
what is it okay for training sets of
five to ten is ideal for
a basically general hypertrophy
especially faster twitch it's ideal for
teaching technique it's okay
for basic strength like if you train
sets of five to ten especially
sets of you know five six and and seven
you will get stronger unless you're
already an advanced power lifter
that might not happen but for almost all
the rest of us bodybuilders included
sets of five to ten generally increase
your strength considerably for example
if you were benching 200 pounds for sets
of eight and then months later you're
benching 230 pounds for sets of eight
and someone asks you like hey do you
think your one rep max improved yeah it
fucking improved right
or if it didn't improve right away just
a couple weeks of training with
lower reps will get your max will shoot
up because underlying wise you built a
ton of muscle and a ton of actually
neurological strength as well
not ideal if you want to be the
strongest person ever
there's times for sets of five to ten
for hypertrophy but when you wanna get
basic stronger sets of three to six are
king however
if you train in that five to ten rep
range it's not all lost and you will
continue to make
probably some strength improvements or
at least not lose a whole lot of
strength
what are sets of five to ten not ideal
for
remotely peaking strength i mean for the
love of god
if you like load your perceived one or
max at a competition someone's like
would you hit in your last week of peak
training you're like i don't know like
90 pounds less than this
for a set of six they're like what the
hell is wrong with you again i'm an
idiot right you go under there
technique changes you get folded over
who the fuck knows great
great way to get injured too secondly
if you're trying to get hypertrophy but
you're doing especially isolation
movements
movements that have a low amplitude for
the isolation movement sometimes it's
just injurious and kind of a little bit
risky
like if you're doing sets of five to ten
in lateral raises for some people the
shoulders just don't handle that shit at
all because it's just one
isolation movement sets of like six in
the tricep push down that's kind of a
little weird some people will report
elbow issues that aren't ideal from that
whereas if you do like sets of six on a
close group bench as compound the weight
can shift from various joint to joint
and it's not a problem
and a lot of times low amplitude moves
so
uh one of the factors of hypertrophy is
volume and volume isn't
yes it's measured as sets times reps
times weight times distance
but that distance is a big difference
between
squats for how much distance your quads
have to move the weight over
versus calf raises in which each one's
like
so if you guys ever tried doing calf
races for like sets of
like eight the set is over in like 10
seconds
you don't have a pump you don't have any
hardly tension perception you don't have
any kind of fatigue you're like
that was kind of like it felt like as
long i felt like a set of one to three
that i would do for my quads and
hilariously it takes like roughly the
same amount of time
so the amount of time your muscles are
actually producing tension
in calf raises for sets of eight is
about the same time as they would
in a squat for like a double right and
then at that point it's like well
doubles aren't ideal
for hypertrophy why the hell would sets
of eight for cavs be and
the reality is usually they're not right
uh
forearm curls a little humor there for
you
insert your favorite masturbation joke
um shrugs
okay really up to the movement like how
long does it take you to do
ten shrugs uh like five seconds or
something one two three four that's it
you're done
and even if it's really good technique
and paused and stuff it just doesn't
take long
and then of course calf raises are the
other big one for those higher rep
ranges are probably more ideal for
hypertrophy
in most cases especially for advanced
individuals otherwise you have to do a
shitload of sets for them which is
annoying in its own right
right lastly folks for whom
joints are a limiting factor in the real
world
may buy us a little bit away from sets
of five to ten in their hypertrophy
pursuit
this includes ultra strong bodybuilders
many times so for example you'll see a
bodybuilder squatting
and they'll do sets of 10 to 12 and
it'll be like after leg press or hack
squat and you'll be like dude why don't
you do like sets five in the squad
like yeah you know that would mean i
have to squat like 7 30 for five with a
lot of pro bodybuilders that's how
strong they are
like last time i did that like almost
herniated a disc and i pulled my quad
and for me like i'm so big and strong
that low reps just don't have a good
trade-off anymore the risk is too high
my joints are too fucked up i'm training
for 20 years that just
joints don't take it like they used to
and also i'm too strong etc
and and that's really a thing so
sometimes you'll see like why are
bodybuilders
when people are saying like you know uh
starting strength got me really jacked
when i was younger to you know to an
intermediate level
sets of five and that was great why
don't why all the pro bodybuilders
training because you know you guys have
seen all the videos a lot of those guys
train with like 15 20 25 reps
percent and you're like why well one of
the reasons is that like
they would love to go heavier it's just
not tenable for them anymore the risk
and reward
just isn't there so there's something
for you guys to consider as well
all right next up sets of
10 to 20 reps in my view
on average huge huge blanket statement
which doesn't apply to a bunch of people
because there's tons of exceptions
it's probably the best hypertrophy range
right
it accommodates nearly all movement
types
isolations compounds machines barbells
low amplitude high amplitude etc
it stimulates all of the pathways of
hypertrophy really well
metabolites the pump tension
even if damage is one of them it does
that shit too it hits all the boxes
really really well for almost every
muscle
for hypertrophy it's almost never the
wrong answer and it's a big range 10 to
20 is a big range
so for your heavier ish preferring
muscles if that's a 10 to 12
for your lighter risk preferring muscles
sets of 18 to 20 or something like that
and then everything else in between is a
really really good
general solution for that problem and
it's really good especially for high
volume hypertrophy training
because the stimulus to fatigue ratios
are really awesome sets of 10 to 20 are
just heavy enough to really get you to
grow and put some great tension through
but not so heavy that it really starts
to impin your uh impinge on your joints
a whole lot
so on average the semester fatigue ratio
is really really good on average there's
tons of exceptions but it's it's almost
never like the wrongest answer in the
world
now if there's a chance that this
hypertrophy training
of various loads and rep brain just
targets different fiber types
or perhaps different pathways like the
metabolite pathway and the pump pathway
and the tension pathway
and then if you just do sets of 10 to 20
all the time
it's okay for targeting the perhaps the
faster twitch fibers and the
tension-mediated pathways
and it's okay for targeting the uh
slower twitch fibers and perhaps the
metabolite pathways and stuff
but it's not like the thing that does
either one of those best like if you
really need high tension you just sets a
five to ten
if you really want to drive a crazy
amount of metabolites you do sets of 20
to 30.
10 to 20 is a great middle ground but
that means it just does both of them
okay the thing is you probably grow a
lot from both
and if you have something that does both
okay it does the best general job
plain and simple right like if you love
pizza and hate birthday cake just go to
a pizza place if you
just hate pizza and love birthday cake
go to one of those cake places
but if you like pizza and birthday cake
about the same you usually like to eat
pizza and then birthday cake
go to a random person's birthday party
usually wearing a trench coat is a good
idea cover your
sunglasses fake mustache hat generally
tends to work well my parole officer
says these jokes are not funny stop
making them
but who cares what he says in any case
like look if you want sort of the best
of both worlds if you want to get the
best meal ever
like on average and not everyone likes
dessert not everyone likes the main
course but generally you want both right
and both together make the meal awesome
so there are times and places
where you do want to do sets of five to
ten and and really 10 to 20 is not the
greatest answer
sometimes there are places where you
want to do 20 to 30 and we'll get to
that in just a bit
but on average 10 to 20 is just tough to
argue against as a kind of a baseline
way to approach training especially when
you're intermediate advanced
now what is it not great for tons of
stuff strength development
okay people ask me on instagram all the
time they're like i see you doing sets
of 15. like does that make you a lot
stronger i'm like
not really i mean like it makes my
muscles bigger and if i wanted to train
my nervous system and technique
make those muscles stronger i could but
then i would have to do other reps so
it's not the best thing for making you
stronger
sure as hell don't see power lifters
doing this hardly ever and it's not by
accident
folks that have underdeveloped technique
shouldn't be doing lots of sets of
10 to 20 reps because it's so fatiguing
and so uh
high duration their technique starts to
break down okay when you do instead of
15
you just think like i just got to get
through this shit like if you do instead
of five to ten you're like all right i
can focus on technique because the shit
is gonna be over pretty soon right
so uh a lot of times people have
problems with technique
and if they come see me what i do is i
say okay enough of this regular training
let's just go back just it's a five to
ten i can go pretty heavy
but i want every rep to be good
technique it's just not realistic to
expect that
from 10 to 20 reps it is when they ever
only master the technique it's totally
fine to keep
going but when you're trying to relearn
and really ingrain new good technique
it's tough to do it sets a 10 to 20.
it's kind of like you either teach
or you really train assess a 10 to 20
it's difficult to do both at the same
time
another thing is some folks seem to have
problems
uh going to low reps in reserve so
approaching failure some folks they have
this thing and it's totally fine
a lot of people have this where they're
like i don't know if i'm like
five reps in reserve or one i can seem
to always grind up more wraps
for folks like that sets of five to ten
are really good
because look at some point the weight's
just too fucking heavy like if you see
someone
that you put the real five to 10 ram in
the bar and they're like i could just
keep going you're like wait
you know here's your 6rm keep going with
that and if they do like 15 reps so
clearly that wasn't their 6rm
but even then if they do 15 reps well
that's your 15 rm but at least you
actually failed and went to failure
whereas if you put someone's what you
think their 10 to 20 rm is
and they're a grinder they can just kind
of keep going you're like fuck we're
like 23 reps like
uh what is even going on here a lot of
times their technique is dog shit by
then
so if you really need to teach folks how
to go to failure uh
sets of five to ten are probably better
right and a lot of times slower twitch
folks
just keep grinding and grinding grinding
you're like this is definitely a
mismatch
so that's something to consider
basically big limitations
now second to last sets of
20 to 30 repetitions what are they good
for well
hypertrophy training with isolations and
machines where you can lock in your
technique there's not a lot of it
to require and just grind like chest
press or tricep extension machine or
something
sets of 25 reps a lot of low amplitude
movements
really great for those high reps because
you can get all the work in that you
need and usually they're not very
technique heavy
potentially develop hypertrophy of the
slower twitch fibers
and potentially go through those
metabolite and pump pathways
continue developing hypertrophy while
providing low joint stress
so for example if your elbows have just
had it with heavy training
you can probably still get really
awesome really good stimulative training
by doing sets of 20 to 30 reps
and it really takes so much pressure off
your joints
yeah you kind of feel like a little
bitch lifting super light but the burn
is crazy you're getting great responses
and you can back away from your joints
maybe for a couple of months you come
back to heavy and your joints have
healed so it's really awesome because a
lot of people tend to think
like man i can't train triceps anymore
because my elbows are beating me up
you're like actually what's your idea of
training triceps like
heavy sets eight skull crushers behind
the neck extension you're like all right
try sets of 25-ish of you know
push-downs or something and you do it
now do your elbows hurt like no it feels
great but i feel like a little bitch for
lifting this little weight like well
cool news you still get a great
hypertrophy response to do this for a
few weeks a few months
and then your elbows will feel 100 fine
you can start going back into the
heavier stuff if that's your preference
that point is extra extra exclamation
mark
when you're coming back from injury
let's say you tore your quad maybe it
wasn't even a big tear just a little one
after four weeks your doctor clears you
to go start lifting again start at 20 30
reps
do not start at five to ten you will
just re-tear the thing with a high
probability start at 20 30 reps
because the forces are so low the growth
comes not a ton from tension as much but
more from the metabolites and the pump
effect
you can maximize those growth pathways
for a short time several weeks or
several months
then when you're feeling super good you
don't feel that injury site at all
slowly increase the weight to get it
back into the 10 to 20 range and then if
it feels great there for a few weeks few
months
you can go back into the five to 10
range and then train through a broad
spectrum of ranges so when you come back
from injuries that's a 20 30 or awesome
because here's two
chances of your injury are the lowest
they can possibly be and
you will possibly be while training hard
and you're still training hard and
getting a great adaptation
because it's it's easy to have this sort
of like
bimodal view of training as it's either
rehab
or i'm fucking fighting godzilla it can
be
graded to where you do rehab you finish
your rehab
you start doing sets of 20 to 30 not so
heavy
then sets the 20 are not so close to
failure then sets a 20
30 closer to failure then sets a 20 to
30 often two failure and then sets of 15
to 20
10 to 15 so on and so forth until you
get to godzilla and then you're
ready to punch that motherfucker in the
mouth bam
you ever thought about if you were
scaled up to godzilla's size
but you retained your like you weren't
like you weren't punching like
like a big guy you could still you know
what i'm saying bob and weave
how would you do against godzilla unfair
because of two things first of all he
has a shitload of spikes everywhere
which blows it where the fuck do you hit
that guy
and also he has like a atomic breath or
whatever
is it difficult to figure out exact
nature but i don't want any
atoms breathing on me fuck that a
nuclear reactor
stay encased so maybe not godzilla but
like king kong
right because he's he's an ape but he
doesn't exactly move as athletically as
like a real ape because he scaled him up
he's kind of slow
i don't know man i don't know plus he's
got a lot of a lot of jiu jitsu
liabilities there you can
wrist lock the fuck out of kong give
that some stuff in your free time when
you have no friends like me in any case
sets of 20 to 30 reps great for all that
stuff what are they okay
for well targeting a broad range of
fibers and here's one of the myths that
died about five years ago
is that high reps don't target the
faster twitch muscle fibers they sure as
fuck do
because those fibers are first of all
recruited right away when you start
lifting just not completely they still
get tension
and secondly especially through the
middle of the set as you start to
fatigue they start getting recruited
more and more and more now
later they get not recruited as much
because you get fatigue and there's a
ton of metabolites in the area
preventing that recruitment
but generally speaking per hard set of
20 to 30 you still get tons of faster
fiber stimulus
so no problems there still still decent
broad range and of course great slower
fiber stimulus
and they're okay for providing sort of
medium-term
growth uh for months actually pretty
good at it but
that's what takes us to the downsides
uh and i'll just skip to the third one
to come back up because this relates to
the first point
it's not clear from the literature and
a lot of bodybuilders have voiced their
opinions on this a lot of coaches
that only training in the 20 to 30 rep
range for example like your quads all
you can do is sets of 20 30 reps you
can't train any heavier than that
it's not clear that that provides the
most robust long-term growth
yeah for you know several months that
probably provides pretty good growth
because the metabolite pathway is pretty
powerful so is the pump pathway
the thing is your body gets really good
at buffering metabolites and not getting
as good of a pump for the amount of
volume you're doing
pretty fast within it's been shown in a
few studies within a few weeks few
months
you're have to do way more volume to get
the same effect and thus your stimulus
to fatigue ratio starts to really go to
hell
like you guys know like the first time
you do a set of like 25
close to failure you get this fucking
crazy gnarly probably oh my fuck and you
get sore like crazy
a few weeks later you do like multiple
sets of 25 you're like i don't know i
just feel kind of tired that adaptation
doesn't really happen with lower rep
training lower up training is effective
now effective tomorrow effective next
year
with higher rep training it might need
to might need to be done in phases
where you do a bunch of it for a while
and you do a little bit less or you do
much work for a while and you do a
little less
you have to let it reset maybe this
isn't for sure maybe it is a great form
of long-term growth
but there's enough skepticism there for
me to cut you guys the real deal
and just let you sort of watch out for
that what i don't want you guys to do
if you're going out it says 20 30 reps
great for the joint still provides
robust hypertrophy i'll just do it all
the time
and dr mike said and then like three
years later you didn't grow nearly as
much as you wanted
because you didn't go super heavy or
like much heavier so it's a 10 to 20
sets of five to ten
and then you experiment you're like fuck
dr mike he's an idiot you start doing
sets of 10 to 25 to 10 and you fucking
just get this revolution of growth and
you're like that fucking asshole
it screwed me out of three years of
optimal growth
just have that on the horizon right and
then of course there are the obvious
things that this rep range is not very
great for
strength development for the love of god
since the 23rd fuck you're talking about
strength
you're not going to get much stronger
doing that unless you're a
super super raw beginner uh faster fiber
focus if
fibers can be focused on with higher
lower weights we're not really sure but
it's a potential
then you know sets of 20 30 are not the
way to get your faster fibers to grow
one example is like hamstring training a
lot of times people really respond to
much heavier weights with hamstring
training
maybe because the hamstrings are a
faster fiber too
so something like that might be in play
um
folks that have underdeveloped technique
i mean for the love of god you do not
teach technique
with sets of 20 to 30 because there it's
just survival like you have to have good
technique to try sets like that
because you've got to lock in the
technique and go as a matter of fact
usually machines and isolations are best
even if the best squat technique or
deadlift technique in the world anything
north of for sure
20 reps your technique is breaking down
almost 100 percent
or it's gonna take you so much effort to
just keep the technique going that your
target muscles aren't even being
stimulated anymore
because your techniques supporting
muscles like your spinal erectors and
the deadlift
they're doing all the fucking work at
that point your glutes are like man i
don't know
and your you know traps are like eh the
load's not heavy enough and you're just
trying to be technical while you're
breathing super heavy
and also folks that can't seem to get to
low reps in reserve they can't get close
to failure i mean sets of 20 to 30
you're setting them up
you know plan sets of 20 30 turn into
sets of like 45 and they're like i can
still
go and you're like put the fucking
weight down fuck this here's your set of
five to ten
you know heavier go do this and then
they actually hit failure they actually
figure out what that's like and then
they go from there so
definitely some limitations there right
what about sets of 30 reps plus now
there's nuance here right
sets of 31 still grow you really well
almost as good as sets of 30. maybe even
sets of 35 maybe if it's a 40 do a good
job
but 40 50 60 we're getting into this
realm where some growth is offered
especially if you're beginner
intermediate but it's nowhere near our
best effort
it is also so light it begs the question
of like why not get much more guaranteed
growth by going back to the 2030 range
and if you're so injured that 20 to 30
is impossible for you
maybe recovery is a bigger emphasis for
you than hypertrophy or something like
that also getting truly to failure or
close to failure sets of 50 it's like
basically impossible because the pain is
going to stop you way before the muscle
stops contracting
so their use in the gym is just
downright questionable
like if i see someone doing like a
straight not like my reps where you
pause a little bit a straight set
you imagine someone doing a curling with
the bar and they're doing this
and you're like all right yeah they're
warming up and they're like at 50 and
you're like damn
long warm up and then they're like at 25
and you're like what's up
metabolite i love it and then they're
like at 36 and you're like
he's still going and then they're like
at 81 and they're still doing this
you're like
i think you've misconstrued what the gym
is for the reason that the weights go on
the bar
is because it makes the bar heavier this
the heaviness that helps you
to have all this it's not the fact that
you can do it 150 times
and they're at like a thousand 651 and
you're like i'm sir what are you doing
get out of my face i'm going for the
all-time easy bar unloaded curl record
i'm sorry jesus there's a camera there i
noticed oops
so honestly going that light is at best
questionable and it works a gigantic
fucking waste of time
they don't these rep ranges 30 plus
especially the plus
um don't reliably build size or strength
well for sure strength
um if you want to develop local muscular
endurance
for sport it is best done in a sports
specific fashion
so if you need endurance to take shots
in wrestling
or to do arm drags in jiu jitsu or
something repeat arm drag game
then you should probably go into a
wrestling room or
a jiu jitsu dojo or whatever fuck dojo
i've been training jiu jitsu for how
many years and fucking call the dojo gym
also
and it's cooler i wish it was called
dojo uh
and you just do sports specific drills
with a training partner right you'd
shoot and come up shoot come up shoot
come up you start to run out of air
uh it's okay your muscles are starting
to fry up keep shooting
because it gives you the technique
practice and the muscular endurance it's
not some shit you really do in a gym
like there's two ways to get better quad
endurance for shooting and reshooting on
an opponent
one way is to do the actual shooting
reshooting in a gym in a wrestling on a
wrestling mat and actually
learn the technique and and do your
timing and the other way is to do like
high rep leg extensions at a fitness
club where like an old lady
is like either scrolling on her cell
phone or is dead and her fingers just
moving like that for no reason
one of those makes you much better
wrestling than the other so
best sport specific and of course
systemic endurance which people say like
man
if i squat for 50 reps it just makes me
better at like everything endurance
because it fucks my lungs and heart up
so much that's totally true
but ostensibly you have a sport in which
you're trying to show off you're not
just trying to become the most endurant
lifter of all time
that is better done through sports if
you want great systemic insurance
fucking go for a jog
or do whatever sport like i do jiu jitsu
competitively
and if i want sport specific jiu jitsu
endurance to go up guess what i do i do
jiu jitsu or repeat drilling or
something like that
start on bottom get out start on bottom
get out start on bottom get out and if
you have training partners they can
three-on-one you
right so there's just one of you and
three of them you beat the one guy
and you get out and the next guy comes
in fresh
you beat him the next guy fresh and
while those guys are waiting they're
resting and you never get a chance to
rest
that gives you both great jiu jitsu or
whatever sport you do acumen
and it builds that endurance way better
than doing it at the gym so
if you see someone doing sets of 80 or
whatever in the gym and they're not
doing rehab or some other weird shit
probably not their best use of gem time
folks
damn i said a lot of shit think about if
you would beat
godzilla maybe you get like a helmet and
a hazmat suit for his atomic breath
uh-huh but but still finger next to here
today so you can you know grab and wrist
lock and stuff
and think of how you would do against
king kong he probably bites
fuck see you guys next time
you
