hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization i forgot my last name
but luckily i didn't forget that today's
topic is designing a
powerlifting peaking program
let's get to it the basic setup first
we're going to talk about what the
purpose of a peaking program is in case
you were curious before starting to
commit yourself to this longer video
then we have to figure out what we have
to know before we actually start the
program critical stuff
we're going to figure out how to align
the training sessions how to select
exercises how to select the loading
range and how much weight to lift
how to select relative effort or how
hard to push ourselves
and of course the initial volume
selection that all builds us
week one of the program in the next
video we'll talk about how to progress
through that program which is a lot of
super super golden gems in and of itself
so here we go
what's the purpose of a pl peaking
program well generally
it's to show off the strength you've
been building
in a very specific way which is to say
through your best one repetition max
right because
at the end of the day if your 5 rm has
gone up by 50 pounds can you say you're
stronger
definitely does anyone really give a
shit unless your uh 1rm has gone up
not in powerlifting circles they don't
so there's a difference between being
really good at hitting sets of five
and really good at hitting sets of one
the peaking program
takes you from being real good at sets
of five to being
custom built designed perfected to be
able to hit the ultimate
set of one and that is really the whole
thing now can
you just test your max by doing a
strength phase deloading and then
testing you can
but if you want absolute best
performance you have to have practice
with lower rep sets of one to three
to get that feel under a heavy bar to
get that technique under a heavy bar to
learn to express yourself
when the weight pushes back crazy crazy
hard at you
it's a technique it's a skill it's a
thing in order to get your absolute best
it's worth doing at least one mesocycle
dedicated to peaking all right what do
we have to know
the big things is first how many weeks
or sorry how many days a week can you
train
so you can't build a program if you
don't know how often to the gym you want
to show up and
how often you and i mean you personally
can go
heavy and hard with each lift without
getting way too fatigued and not being
able to sustain that during the peaking
phase
generally speaking people will be able
to do hard lifting in a lift
one to three times a week on average
which means you can actually have tons
of other sessions in there which are a
little lighter a little easier
for technique work for recovery work but
you may only deadlift hard on a peeking
program
once a week you may squat two or three
times a week
you may bench hard heavy two or three
times a week and almost no one
does hard lifting more frequently than
that some people
do lighter lifting more frequently we'll
see an example of that in a little bit
but that's how many hearts
uh sessions you should be doing one to
three is a big range it's up to you to
figure it out start on the conservative
end
and if it really is pretty easy you can
move up in a later attempt at a peaking
program from there and you'll also know
a lot about this
if you just did a strength program if
you're new to this uh series
check out all the videos in the series
before this it'll really get you primed
for the actual peaking stuff and of
course
a lot of this depends on age training
age recovery ability
strength so on and so forth if you're
older if your coverage is not as great
and if you're super fucking ridiculously
strong
you won't be able to do a ton of
sessions of super heavy lifting
if you are smaller weaker lighter so on
and so forth and younger you'll be able
to
you know go hard three times a week on
squat bench press and dead lift
potentially
and and not pay any price and that'll
actually be your best bet
so training session assignment
uh i've said this in all the other
videos for design for i perched me and
strength i'll say it here
if you can't commit to at least four
training sessions
total per week this whole video is
probably lost on you because the rest of
the ship's way more advanced you got to
have some buy-in four days is kind of a
minimum investment to get your best
result
the sessions those four sessions should
address movement categories well two to
four times per week and it can actually
be
higher than four if you choose five
sessions you can actually do some kind
of benching
five times a week but usually two to
four is more than sufficient
and there has to be enough time between
every session to heal for the next one
the point of program design isn't to
cram as much in it as possible be like
oh like fuck i can't recover from this
the point is to have just enough stuff
to where the next time you're like oh
i'm ready to bench again
you're recovering you're ready to bench
to squat to deadlift so on and so forth
right
remember just one to three of these of
the two to four will be hard and heavy
the rest of them will be lighter
technical work which we'll get into the
specifics in a little bit
or we'll be work for a little bit more
hypertrophy and muscle mass maintenance
not nearly as fatiguing but still every
time you show up to the hardcore stuff
you've got to be really well recovered
and if it's too many sessions for you to
do that you got to contract them or if
you're just
twiddling your thumbs you're like man i
was healed days ago and my next squat's
not until two days from now you should
add in more sessions
and the way you add them is not random
you have to be
intelligent about moving them apart from
each other and strategically placing
them in such a way that they don't
interfere for example
if tuesday you do super arch and
retracted competition benching
you will have a sore lower back sore mid
back too
sore upper back if you do it well enough
and then if your wednesday is a
your heaviest deadlift day of the week
what the fuck were you thinking because
you're going to get to the deadlifts and
you'll be like fuck my back is sore and
you're not going to hit the pr's you
want you're going to have a shady
training session
and then all of a sudden you're not
doing your best so if your heavy
benching is on tuesday
maybe your heaviest deadlifting could be
on a friday or something like that so
when you get to your heaviest
deadlifting
you're completely healed super recovered
and you're ready to go so a lot of that
is a consideration that doesn't mean you
can't do the lifts in between each other
but if you have some hard lift hard left
hard lift in between you got a pepper in
lighter technical work it can't just be
hard hard hard or hard all the time
or a cluster of hard lifting than a
bunch of easy stuff because towards the
end of that cluster whatever hard lift
is last let's say monday tuesday
wednesday
whatever hard lift you do wednesday it's
really not hard
it feels hard but it's really because
you're way too beat up not because
you're trying as hard as you could be if
you were more recovered and intelligent
about
spreading out your days a little bit
more
sample check this out so if you remember
from the hypertrophy and the strength
stuff
they actually look pretty similar the
sample training session assignment here
is different
you'll notice that we actually do two
movement patterns per session we have
four sessions a week
monday squats and deadlifts tuesday is
benches and squats what the fuck
back-to-back squats yep
totally fine you know which one of those
do you think is going to be
the are they both going to be heavy it's
very unlikely one of them is probably
going to be technique work one of them
is not right
then deadlifts and benches then benches
the squats again this is just a way to
do this
it's not the only way and remember if
this looks crazy
if you're thinking fuck heavy squats and
deadlifts in the same day
nope there's kind of sort of three
potential ways we could be doing it
one is ultra hard ultra heavy another is
pretty heavy for a little bit higher
repetitions
and the last one is easy recovery
session that's just a few sets and reps
of really light weight
we're going to be spreading those all
out so that you're never in a situation
where back to back days you're doing the
same lift
hard and heavy that's not going to
happen if it's happening you're probably
not doing so well for yourself you have
to rethink your program so don't let
this intimidate you and be like holy
shit that's a lot of stuff
a lot of it like when it says benches
and squats on tuesday those second
squats on tuesday
could just be the easiest fucking thing
in the world it's like you know
three by three at seventy percent one rm
and you could do it with your eyes
closed right
great for technical practice probably
recovers you for your heavier squats
on let's see that saturday potentially
even better than if you did nothing at
all
but it's definitely not something where
we go super hard all the time so don't
let this freak you out
all right exercise selection this part's
super easy
almost all should be the actual power
lifts themselves like if you're
in a peaking phase the huge point of the
peaking phase is to train your nervous
system and your technical abilities
which
emanates from your nervous system
entirely on how to handle super heavy
loads
in the competition lift so if you're
really really good
at doing high bar squats but you compete
with a low bar squat
you gotta what are you doing right you
got to get good with low bar squats
which means
unless you have a really good reason not
to do it you have to stick to extreme
specificity in the peaking phase
your deadlifts are going to be
competition setup which also means
your straps gone chalk on
competition belt on competition stance
and every single set
is restart ideally i don't want to press
this too much but ideally
everything's kind of treated like a
single in the deadlift where
you deadlift you put it down like you
would in a meet you come back up
reset another rap boom so if you're
doing a triple
definitely don't touch and go but even
if you're doing stop and start it's
totally fine to do stop and start when
you keep your hands on the bar
but ideally especially once you get into
doubles and stuff if you're doing
doubles
it's worth just to do them as sort of
cluster singles instead
really let go of the bar come back up
reset and go again because the
specificity there is super super high
right so actual power lifts
competition style you can
do some assistance move so if you've
learned over time
that if you don't do some assistance
work some muscles of yours reduce in
size and you get weaker
i had a buddy that i was uh helping him
with this training for a while
that if he didn't do heavy flies during
his peaking phase crazy i know
his chest would start to get smaller in
size and you think why didn't he just do
more wide grip or more competition
benching because that was way too
fatiguing
so it turns out the best stimulus to
fatigue ratio for him was to do his
heavy benching just like normal normal
volume
and then add some heavy flies at the end
that actually kept his strength up
better than if we got rid of flies
most people aren't like that so he
wasn't doing the flies just for shits
and giggles or to get a big chest pump
he was doing it because he had to do it
if you're in a situation where you
notice like just the competition lifts
alone
aren't stimulating a muscle enough and
it's actually getting smaller and weaker
on you
absolutely you can add assistance work
but unless that's the case don't do it
if you don't need them do not include
them
the highest level of power lifting
usually the guys don't do hardly any
assistance work at all
they'll do their heavy bench for that
day they'll all their squat for that day
they'll do like two or three sets on a
glute ham raise like for sets of three
or something just to get the hamstrings
a little bit and they just fuck right
off
and and leave the thing is once you get
really big and strong the warm-ups and
lifts themselves take so much time
that's a two-hour workout i just
described right so don't be in a rush
just do tons of assistance work at the
end of the day you want your fatigue to
be low
and with just a bare minimum of peaking
work you won't
in almost every case almost there's
exceptions like the friend i just
described
you won't lose any muscle and you lose
any strength even if you do the bare
minimum of peaking work
so do the bare minimum peaking work
until and unless there is a good reason
not to
right and we'll talk about this in the
progression stuff
you can start with a lot of assistance
work but in the next video we'll
describe that you actually start
removing assistance work as you get
closer to the meat
because the concern for muscle loss is
much less less time and also because you
need to drop fatigue down like crazy and
nothing drops fatigue like taking out
entire exercises
and sets that you're doing much lower
volume much less fatigue
so that's exercise selection basically
just the power lift and a couple of
other things here's a sample for
our a program pause the video at this
time give it a look
it should all make a ton of sense if it
doesn't ask a question in the youtube
comments and maybe we'll make a
follow-up video or something like that
uh should make sense just as an example
again this is not dogma
don't be like why exactly do you have a
low bar squat here not a high bar squat
well it's more specificity but can i do
a high bar squat yeah probably you
probably can
this is just an example to illustrate
how the theory operates
all right so we got the days of training
we got all the lifts in
what about loading range selection okay
peaking is best done under one to three
rep range okay if you're doing sets of
four five six
you're not getting the kind of loads on
your back in your hands so on and so
forth
that really prepare you for on a rems
you need to be doing mostly sets of
heavy singles doubles or triples right
now you'll also be doing what we term
technique work which is a way to get
more
technique for the lift a little bit more
hypertrophic stimulus just a tiny bit to
keep the muscles on
and you'll pepper these technique
sessions in between the heavy ones
the recommendation for technique is
super super simple you do around 70
percent of your wonder at max
and you do very very low rpe
because it's sets of three to six okay
so technique works sets of three to six
reps
very low rpe so rp like
sometimes four to six at most
and seventy percent of one arm and you
plug in 70 of 1rm and do it for sets of
3x6 it's gonna have to be very low rpe
and if that's high rpe do fewer reps or
less load okay it has to be larpee if
your technique work is beating you up
it's not technique work it's overloading
work and you're going to poison the rest
of your program
because your actual heavy lifting days
are going to be too fatigued to be as
good as they could be
right the exception here is for
deadlifts more like 60 1rm is better
because deadlifts exceptionally beat
your ass as you're probably familiar
with
now that's on the main lifts and the
technique work assistance lifts it's
okay to go up to sets of ten
totally fine not on the main moves
especially if you get better stimulus to
fatigue ratio so you guys will see
we keep some assistance work like we
keep like lateral raises or something
for shoulders you can do those versus
ten
that does not have to be sets of one to
three that's kind of insane right
and exercise order matters a ton with
loading range
so you want to do the main movements
first assistance move later okay if you
come in
then you have to do some shoulders and
back and some bench pressing that
day bench press first then do shoulders
and back
okay and also heavy lifts first
technique work later so for example
if you guys ever see and you will
actually in the beginning of this we had
the
the main priorities laid out like monday
is like well let's see let's scroll back
up
um monday in this sample
was squats and deadlifts deadlifts are
second
squats are first that means you 100 know
squats are heavier that day deadlifts
are lighter or technique work
must be because the heavier lifts always
go first tuesday benches and squats you
know for a fact benches are going to be
heavier squats are going to be lighter
thursday deadlifts and benches that's
going to be
heavy deadlifts lighter benches bench
and squat saturday means bench is gonna
be pretty good pretty heavy
and then uh squats are gonna be not
their heaviest through the week it has
to be like that
because you have the most energy at the
beginning of the lift you're never gonna
do this
stupid shit where you're like oh i got
through the easy stuff now it's time for
the real hard stuff you leave that
in bodybuilding sometimes that has a
place and power lifting it doesn't you
do the hard stuff the heaviest stuff
first every single time all right
so now
this isn't the only way to do things i
have to keep repeating myself i'm just
going to stop in a minute here
here is a sample and feel free to pause
and really look
it has your loading range which is
reflected in
repetitions so for example monday squats
and deadlifts this is low bar squat
uh has you know sets of one to three
low bar good morning sets of three to
six okay and those are hard heavy sets
of three to six
that's that's the assistant's work and
then
competition deadlift has three to six
reps it's at the end and you say oh my
god i just did
squats and good mornings when am i in a
deadlift well not much because that's a
three to six but it's technique
so it's 70 percent everyone rm or sorry
in the case of deadlifts 60
so it's super easy so feel free to pause
and look through the rest of this it
should make some sense
unless i have a typo and then it doesn't
all right
lastly relative effort selection
so or sorry was it lastly no good god
second to last i'm getting ahead of
myself
second to last relative effort selection
so
you have to use rpe not reps in reserve
because it's very low reps so
first that's the case second
you have to get accustomed to ultra
heavy loads
in the peaking phase that's the whole
point but
ultra heavy loads and the heaviest
possible loads you could be lifting are
two different things
you have to ease into the peaking phase
so it's probably a good idea
to start with like a 7rp effort
and you want to guess at that
in your first week of peak how's that
going to be a guess well here's the
thing
you're starting a little bit lighter and
lower rpe so it's probably a good idea
to just start with triples that's not
always the case okay variation can be
used more in advance people especially
you could start with singles or start
with doubles
you can you do singles doubles and
triples actually in the same workout if
you want in
in the same first week but if you just
did a strength phase
and you did sets of three to six reps at
the end of the strength phase you may
have done
quite a few triples hard heavy if your
peeking face starts with triples
fuck man you already know right around
where that is gonna be so there's a
smooth entry
and there's no mystery if you start with
singles right away
yeah it's a tough sell and you might
have to figure it out but once you get
your triples going
then next week you could do doubles week
after that you could do singles and then
not only is the weight ascending like it
should be
but you're getting a feel for what load
you need every single time that happens
right
basic basic kind of stuff here here's an
example
i plugged in totally random weights that
makes sense within their own context so
take a look
see if it makes any sense all right
what about volumes okay you have to
choose
enough work sets in that first week to
get you a good robust stimulus
which we judge as a considerable drop in
strength in the target muscle or
movement in this case the movement
if you can't hit your rep range at your
rpe goal
okay sets of three at rp7 or something
with any more or sorry any less than a
five percent drop in load
you have a problem so let's make this
super simple example
if you're doing a hundred pounds for you
know three sets of three or something
if on the third set of three you're like
oh i'm not gonna hit rp7 on this set of
three
i got to reduce the load if you go to 95
pounds
and you successfully accomplish three
repetitions
and it's actually our p7 you're good to
go but if you
say oh well i need to do a fourth set
totally fine maybe
but if you're fourth set you're like
yeah to hit an rp7
at three reps like i was planning
with you know this bench press or
whatever exercise
i can't go from 100 to 95 it's going to
have to go to 90 well that's
more than 5 at that point you're just
pissing away
your fatigue for no good goddamn reason
so if there's a 5
drop in your ability to do anything it's
time to cut off that lift
and it's time to stop doing it okay so
every exercise is treated like that for
volume
and of course because you're only using
the basic exercises sort of one movement
at a time
that solves our volume equation no
problem that's the first week relatively
easy to figure out
what about technique work you'll never
really get tired of that you could do 10
sets of
3 at 70 my best recommendation to you is
in most cases to just do
three sets and that's it cap technique
work at three sets start with three sets
end your mess with three sets
because it's just good practice any less
it's not enough practice
much more and you're just getting
fatigued for no reason right
especially if you just get more fatigued
after so
if four sets is something that really
gets you into the groove and you feel
super crisp i can't tell you not to do
four sides
but if you're doing four or five sets
and by the end you're like getting tired
physically from technique work you're
doing a huge disservice to yourself
never get tired technique should feel
crisp and then you should be out
there's no crisp until it doesn't we
don't want to get to the it doesn't part
don't ever in peaking for sure in
peaking do so many sets
that you get super sore and you can't
heal for next time or your strength
doesn't recover for your next big
strength lift
okay so if you do so much in week one
that by week two you're like oh i have
to do more heavy stuff
you fucked up and nobody cares how much
volume you do in your peaking phase
at all what they care about is how well
you do at your next powerlifting meet
maybe if they care about anything at all
so make sure to err on the side
of not a crazy amount now here's the
kicker we're actually
going to take volume and reduce it over
time
in this peaking phase so the normal
advice is error on the easy side
here it's not here is air on the higher
to
uh moderate or sorry moderate to higher
end of volume
which means you're going to do like a
pretty fucking decent chunk
and you're going to say man if i have to
do this volume for three or four weeks
of peaking
this won't be sustainable good it
shouldn't be sustainable
because every week we're going to be
removing some volume and it doesn't have
to be sustainable
we have to start with plenty and then go
down very different than the way we
normally do things because it's a peak
you'll be lowering through the peak so
know that don't start with a psychotic
amount that won't let you do week two
start with an amount that if you
continue to do it you wouldn't be able
to do it for three weeks but
that comfortably allows you to do a very
productive week too
everything else will take care of itself
initial volume selection example feel
free to pause take a look at this
just just a sample here all right folks
that's it for the actual design of the
peeking phase and you'll notice
that it's like what the where's all the
shit about like what i do week to week
and how i actually plan to compete at a
meet and
how long to taper for aha that's going
to be in our next video
which is going to be a bit longer
because actually doing the peak
is a huge deal big difference we'll see
you
there for that final video of the series
see you next week
you
