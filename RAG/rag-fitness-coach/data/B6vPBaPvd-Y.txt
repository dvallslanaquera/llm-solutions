supplements can help your weak points
not sure what that means but let's find
out greens for example I don't eat
enough vegetables throughout the day I
hate vegetables greens powders do not
replace vegetables nearly to the extent
that we would like so they're mostly
useless and a multivitamin multimineral
can give you almost everything you need
out of the greens powder uh and in a
pill so greens Powers have a very very
low utility and are not really backed by
any kind of convincing
research
