the reality is that more complicated
does not necessarily mean
more effective that is a key thing to
understand so i'll say it again okay
more complicated does not necessarily
mean more effective
what's up guys sean aliwani
realscienceathletics.com
uh apologies if there's a little bit of
wind noise here today um i'm working on
getting my video stuff moved indoors
uh but i still wanted to get this video
out today and in this video i want to
talk about
one of the many aspects of instagram
fitness
that just annoys me to no end and that
leads a lot of lifters down the wrong
path
and that is the swipe workout so if you
spend any amount of time scrolling
through
instagram fitness content like most of
us do especially if you're still a
novice lifter
then this is for you before i dive into
the subject if you're new to the channel
and you find this advice helpful

and if you're looking for no bs straight
ahead instagram fitness content
without all the fluff that will
genuinely help you reach your goals and
you can follow me there as well
it's at sean nalawani so for those who
don't know
a swipe workout is basically where
someone posts a video sequence
of usually four to six different
exercises showing a complete workout
that you can then copy and use in your
own training
and after being on instagram for years
and seeing an endless number
of these different swipe workouts pop up
in my feed there are a few problems that
i see with a pretty high percentage of
them
probably like 75 plus so i'm not saying
that they're all bad and they're all
totally useless
but in the majority of cases there are
some things that you should be aware of
since it's very tempting to just see a
given sequence of lifts being performed
by someone who's in great shape
um and who you're following and who you
look up to and to then want to take that
exact workout and just emulate it for
yourself
thinking that you're going to get the
same results by following it so first is
the issue of what could be called
for lack of a better term around
itis in other words
because instagram fitness is so
oversaturated with
millions of pieces of content being
uploaded every single day content
creators
very often feel like they have to
present something new and unique
in order to stand out and make it seem
like they have some special
exercise variations that you've never
seen before and that are going to get
you better results than following
something more basic
for example it's not very exciting to
show a chest workout
consisting of a flat barbell press
followed by an incline dumbbell press
even though that would be a simple and
highly effective way to train your chest
and so what you end up with
a lot of the time is this goofy sequence
of elaborate
you know one arm twisting kneeling
incline alternating cable press
variations or
something along those lines basically
just unnecessary fluff exercises that
are
at best redundant and at worst either
less effective than just using
basic core lifts or that might even put
you at risk for injury
or possibly both for example something
like this which is not necessarily bad
but there's nothing special about it
either or something just straight up
idiotic like this
which has no added benefit over a
regular barbell or dumbbell press and
will actually
increase your chances for shoulder
injury and this applies to all body
parts okay chest
back shoulders legs etc the reality is
that
more complicated does not necessarily
mean more effective that is a
key thing to understand so i'll say it
again okay more complicated does not
necessarily mean
more effective and just because someone
has an impressive physique
and shows a video of themselves
performing some fancy exercise variation
that doesn't mean that you need to be
performing that same exercise or that
they even perform it regularly
themselves in their own training
or that they actually built their
physique that way um the simple truth is
that the vast majority of your genetic
muscle building potential
can be built using fundamental basic
compound lifts
you know squats dead lift variations
free weight chest presses overhead
presses
pull-ups pull-downs rows etc and you're
not going to experience some magical
increase in your gains
by following some sequence of never
before seen lifts and doing that could
actually end up giving you worse results
by diverting your focus away from the
proven basics so
i'm of course not saying that you should
never experiment with new exercise
variations
or that every unique exercise out there
is bad
but the bottom line is that striving for
progressive overload on the basic
compound movements
that should make up the cornerstone of
your workouts if you're looking to
achieve
the most efficient gains and there's no
need to unnecessarily
over complicate things with a bunch of
fancy lifts especially if you are
a beginner to intermediate who is still
working on building up an overall size
and strength foundation
and if you want to get access to a solid
reliable sequence of lifts laid out in a
step-by-step training routine
format to help you gain size and
strength as efficiently as possible or
to lean down as well
on the fat loss as your main goal then

so make sure to head over there after
the video if you are interested
now the second issue i see um with a lot
of these swipe workouts
um and by the way make sure to comment
below and let me know what aspects of
instagram fitness
you personally aren't a fan of because
there are many problems with it besides
just this
but the second issue is that most of
them tend to be a
single body part focus so you might see
a full bicep
routine or a shoulder routine or a chest
routine with a sequence of four or five
or sometimes even six
exercises just for that one body part
however
the truth is that there's really no need
to perform that many lifts
for one muscle in a single workout
unless you're doing some sort of
once a week body part split now body
part splits
can still produce significant results as
long as you're achieving progressive
overload
in the overall picture it's not that
they don't work but it's not going to be
the very best approach for most lifters
especially for novice to intermediates
because the
weekly frequency per muscle group is
just too low so rather than going into
the gym and
hammering the out of one muscle
group on one day with five different
exercises and then waiting an entire
week
to hit that muscle again instead you'll
almost certainly get faster gains by
splitting things up
and training each individual muscle
group something like one and a half to
two times per week
and you can do that very effectively by
just performing a full body routine
three days per week an upper lower split
three to four days per week
or a legs push pull split four to five
days per week which i've talked about
in the past those three layouts alone or
even just one or two of them
can absolutely get you right up near
your genetic potential within a few
years of training if you apply them
properly
but i guess having you know a basic full
body swipe workout or an upper lower
swipe workout
just isn't as exciting or eye-catching
as
you know six killer bicep exercises or
five movements for massive pecs or
whatever
so that's something that you will very
rarely see and then the final issue
um and make sure to hit the like button
below if you do agree with these points
so far
uh but this ties in with the previous
one and that's that very often the
overall volume is also excessive in
terms of the total number of sets
for example i see regularly guys posting
shoulder routines that are
20 plus sets per session you know five
exercises with four sets each
or tricep focus workouts that are 14
sets in total maybe four exercises
three to four sets each keep in mind
that as long as you're training hard
and generating sufficient intensity of
effort on each set so around one to two
reps short of muscular failure
um assuming you're truly going close to
failure then you really don't need to be
performing endless sets
and cranking out these super high volume
routines in order to optimize your gains
as a natural lifter
i think around 8 to 15 hard sets per
muscle group per week
is plenty in the vast majority of cases
in order to
stimulate maximum growth um some people
can do a bit more so that's just
you know a general guideline but going
too far beyond that will usually just
push you past your ability to optimally
recover um it will also increase your
chances for injury
and it will just burn you out in general
not to mention that it's an unnecessary
time investment as well
so unless you are an enhanced lifter
like a lot of these guys on instagram
are the amount of volume contained in a
lot of these swipe workouts is really
just overkill
and that transitions into the final
point which is critical to understand
like i just mentioned
and that's that a very high percentage
of the most followed bodybuilding
accounts on instagram okay the ones who
swipe workouts are most likely to appear
in your feed
are enhanced lifters and when you're
using performance-enhancing drugs the
entire game changes you can perform
more exercises and more total sets
higher frequency and still recover from
it you can still make
fantastic gains off of a body part split
and you can still get great results even
if you're using sub-optimal exercise
variations
so what very often happens is that these
enhanced lifters are posting
recommendations based on what has worked
for them or what they think is best even
though it's essentially
the opposite of what would be ideal for
a natural to intermediate lifter
with somewhere around average genetics
which probably makes up 90 percent or
more of the people watching this video
right now
so these are just some things to be
aware of because aside from youtube
instagram is another place where people
frequently go for fitness information
but unfortunately
a lot of the content that you find there
can be very misleading and these over
complicated
excessive volume swipe workouts are one
of the big problems that i come across
