hey folks dr mike israel for renaissance
periodization
i want you guys to do me a huge favor
vote in the comments below
who would win in a fight a stegosaurus
or a triceratops not some rules they're
not fucking superpower
and by the way they're dumb as shit
because they're fucking dinosaurs
but i want you to tell me who would win
in a fight assuming they're both
requisitely aggressive
the the winning comment for which you
win nothing except youtube fame by the
way which is itself a great thing
is going to have a good explanation
mechanistically or strategically
how either the stegosaurus whether
triceratops wins the fight
and look at his dinosaur fight so it's
to the death but if that doesn't
interest you
maybe this will using muscle disruption
to regulate your training volume in
hypertrophy training
please watch our video about the pump in
this little mini series
the one that came right before this last
week this week we talk about muscle
disruption to alter your
volume first we're going to talk about
what the hell muscle consumption is why
we should care about it
second we're going to talk about muscle
disruption as a partial tool
to inform training volume status and
lastly we're going to talk about how to
use muscle disruption
as sort of estimated in your own body
from training
to up or down or keep volume the same
all right
so here we go what the fuck is muscle
disruption i sure as
hell hope i'm not swearing too much for
youtube to delicious shit like that
damn youtube mark zuckerberg
i don't know here's the thing
muscle disruption occurs when a muscle
has been trained
hard okay it is disrupted to some extent
and that presents in
at least three ways local fatigue
perturbation and soreness local fatigue
is the simplest one
you know you're disrupting a muscle when
set to center set it gets weaker
okay if you can go all out to failure
this is especially easy to measure with
failure but it's totally fine to measure
with rir as well
if you go super all up to failure and
you do a set of curls with 100 pounds
for 10 reps
you rest like the normal out two to
three minutes or whatever
can you get another 10 reps maybe for
one set you can
maybe even for two but if you're like
doing six sets of curls and it's 10 10
10 10 and they're all to failure
either you're not really fucking
training a failure
or you're doing no disruption at all
you're the most recoverable person ever
and you should just run endurance
marathons because holy shit
it's just not going to happen for almost
anyone you see
a drop off especially after a few cents
in performance
that is local fatigue the muscles just
running out of juice because it's being
disrupted some
metabolites are getting too high in
concentration they're interfering with
muscle contraction you're running out of
fuel for contraction
and so on down the line fundamentally
it's a good thing because it tells you
like i'm doing some shit
if someone said hey are you training
hard enough to get good gains and you're
like well i never get weaker in any
workout like i show up to the workout
and i'm just as strong when i leave
ah man i think you're just warming up
but if you come to the workout and you
leave like
damn near debilitated and unable to lift
for five which you used to do for ten
fuck at least at least you're not
training too easy
right very likely second is perturbation
this one's a little bit more nebulous
but nonetheless pretty easy to define
perturbation is when something is wrong
about how your muscle contraction
process occurs or how you perceive it
something is off and even normal
movement patterns can present with
coordination difficulties
some of you have the memory of the first
time you ever did a hardcore bicep
workout and
you tried to brush your teeth later that
night and you're like holy fuck
i'm gonna go to bed with dirty teeth
because i can't fucking move my arm
properly and i can't coordinate the shit
if you play basketball try doing a ball
or arm workout and then shooting hoops
after you're like
i used to be athletic i swear to god
about this bad basketball what the fuck
is happening with my muscles
something clearly happened to them
sometimes but not always this occurs
with cramping
you know you perturbed the muscle when
you do a bunch of leg presses and you
stand up out of them you're like oh
fuck fuck my quads like somebody could
say you're training too easy but for the
love of god if your muscles are cramping
that's at least some evidence to say
like you you sure just held disrupted
something right something definitely
took a hit
and almost a quintessential example of
this
is what your legs feel like walking down
a flight of stairs after a
hardcore leg workout if you hit legs
hardcore you certainly think you did
and you can fucking marry pop and style
hop skip down the stairs no problem
i usually when i exit any gym i do that
anyway because i'm fabulous
but if you can just run down the fucking
stairs you may think you trained your
legs hard that's probably not true
especially for hypertrophy
if you did a real hardcore approach to
workout that causes a lot of muscle
growth
how would you climb down the stairs uh
you know how it is
you grab fucking the railings and if
it's a short staircase or a
narrow one you grab both of them shits
and you're like oh fuck fuck fuck that
and your legs almost give out they
fucking almost get out you're like
something's wrong your quads are doing
this all the time you're super weak
that is perturbation if you get a high
degree of perturbation
you may have 99 problems but not
training that muscle hard enough is
probably not one of them and it's
probably not something that's causing
your lack of growth
you may be training way too hard we'll
get to that in a bit but it's certainly
not hard enough is it very very unlikely
okay and lastly the easiest one is
soreness notice i didn't say doms
because dom is just one type of soreness
you can get soreness that occurs
right after you can never get that deep
soreness of doms but i'm just peripheral
like
my biceps don't feel like deal shit is
definitely going on in there
that's still soreness and it may go away
like 12 hours later or a day later but
some shit still happened
and of course all the way up to dom's
that can last shit a week
right it's not necessarily good to have
more soreness but i will say that if you
don't get sore at all
maybe you could train a little bit
harder and if you're getting super
fucking psychotic soreness to where you
can't move for days on end
again you may have 99 problems but not
training hard enough is unlikely or
rather
less likely to be one of them than if
you just didn't get sword at all and got
moderate soreness
so just to be clear muscle disruption is
one of our indirect tools for assessing
the
probability that we are signaling muscle
growth is not the only thing
it by itself can't tell you for sure if
you're growing muscle and sure shit
can't tell you how much muscle you're
growing you're like yeah
i got this level of sore that means i'm
gonna gain this much muscle fuck out of
here it doesn't work like that
unfortunately i wish it did and we do
have to use other signs to make our
most educated guess uh the pump
performance
definitely a thing that we have to know
about but it can be
an important factor especially at the
margins especially at the extremes so
let's get to it how do you auto regulate
volume
by using muscle disruption first we
mentioned this in the earlier video
set quality has to be there okay some
people are like man
hamstring curls i don't get sore unless
i do eight cents
and i'm like really let me see you do
them sets and the first working set is
like a fucking warm up it's like 10 rar
i'm like do you shut the fuck up first
of all your technique sucks you're going
halfway down each time
and second of all you're quitting like
10 reps early you actually teach someone
to do a real set
of a legit full range of motion wrap
every single time with a slow eccentric
control to fucking break the hams down
and they're pushing real close to
failure two or three reps in reserve
after two sets they get up and they're
like oh fuck fuck fuck fuck i can't move
my hands are going to cramp like uh-huh
and you said eight sets right
so don't alter your volume until you get
your quality set
first once you have your quality in
place then you can figure out how much
muscle disruption you have and inform at
least to some extent
what you're going to be doing with your
volume first
if there's no disruption at all like you
train chests
and someone's like how's your chest feel
and you're like fucking golden i'm just
as strong
nothing's cramping nothing feels weird
and then two days later you don't
zero soreness ever it's very likely you
can probably add a set to that session
next week at least
and grow more because with that little
disruption there's no really good
reason for us to believe you've
stimulated a lot of growth remember most
growth is stimulated when you push your
muscles to their limits at least close
to them
how the fuck can you tell you push the
shit to limit if you're still like as
golden as you ever were
right unlikely possible but unlikely
next if the disruption is notable but
not earth shattering
like you're maybe a bit sore after
training but let's say you train
twice a week for legs and you only get
sore for like a day
and you spend two days waiting around
not sore like
yeah it's possible that that's a good
level of stimulus and you may not have
to increase sets
but you can add a set but probably not
any more than that
if you did three sets of tricep
extensions they got sore for a day and a
half
and then they healed and you waited
another day and a half to train them
again you can add a set
you could leave it alone but don't have
like two cents or some shit because that
could get you so disruptive and so sore
that might be causing more damage than
hypertrophy because that's definitely a
possibility
next point number c or point c i don't
know if i can say that
article c if disruption is
very significant and or barely
recoverable
we have some other options there so for
example you limp down the stairs after
legs they get
super frickin sore and you heal just
before the next session like your
legs are on friday session number two
and like
thursday night you're moving your legs
around the couch watching netflix you're
like
fuck they're still fucking sore and then
friday morning you wake up and you move
around and you're like oh shit they
healed fuck
thank god barely right that is an
example of what we're talking about here
in point c
is like the limits of your recovery you
are recovering but just barely
and soreness isn't the only thing here
so if you train super high frequency
legs and
they cramp every session you train legs
five days a week they never get sore
because it's a small amount of volume
but every session they cram and every
session you fatigued where you're
squatting like
ten ten six five reps or something like
that like
you're disrupting the fuck out of them
and you're barely able to drag it and
hit another hard workout next time okay
that's
an example of peak levels of disruption
and
in that case it almost is a self-solving
question
if someone says like hey okay i got
these peak levels i barely healed on
time to have another great workout
should i add more volume what why if you
add more volume you'll almost certainly
go in the too far
and you won't heal on time and you won't
have another great workout okay good
point
should i do less well maybe but if
you're healing on time you're still
having great workouts
maybe this is like as good as it gets
right so there's no good argument for
doing less
there's a shitty argument for doing more
so if this happens if you're just
healing on time man that's almost
flawless
just keep the same level of volume until
unless something changes when you do
something else lastly if the disruption
is way
overkill notice the way i said way is
exactly how i wrote it down
uh here's an example soreness or
weakness does not recover
before your next session so if you're
doing super high frequency squatting
every day
you had a great squat workout monday
great one tuesday wednesday's total shit
because you're like dude it's tuesday
fuck me up beyond recognition there's no
way i can perform and you don't and then
thursday sucks
or if you train legs more reasonably
like twice a week or something
you train monday and you're supposed to
train again thursday and like you wake
up thursday morning and your quads are
still peaks or the point where it's hard
for you to walk up and down stairs
holy shit man that's way too much right
what do we mean by too much it means
that the amount of damage you caused is
probably here and the amount of
hypertrophy comes along for the ride but
since the damage is so high and actually
competes with hypertrophy your body
can grow maximally or can recover
maximally but it can't do both at the
same time
some growth stimulus comes along with
the ride as far as damage is concerned
but there can be a level of damage
that's so excessive your body's just
like dude fuck this growing business
we just have to make sure we save these
muscles from just like deteriorating the
blood
so just focus on recovery you don't
actually grow any muscle totally totally
possible and reasonable to do by
yourself if you get ultra ultra sore
and you get super fucked up your your
performance just falls right to the
floor
it is possible to do people do it
regularly all the time so if
that occurs to you do not
increase volume for sure if
you thought you overdid it but the
soreness data isn't around yet because
it's just the first day
see how it works to the end of the week
so let's say monday
perturbation uh told you that you're
like
okay i could barely walk i had to sit
for 30 minutes before i left the gym
and i think i fucking overdid right and
from the earlier video your pump was
just completely out of this world
your reps dropped off like crazy the
point where you're squatting your own
body weight and barely able to stand up
do you think fuck man i'm gonna get sore
as fuck wait and see
until next thursday when it's time to
train legs again and let's say
they're just completely toasted sore two
things you have to do
thing one reduce the volume and thursday
reduce the load so it's a recovery
session
and next time almost certainly reduce
the volume next monday so if it's seven
sets of leg press just to keep it simple
that fucked you up so hard that you
couldn't even heal by thursday on monday
next monday do not just go in and do
seven sets
because you're probably gonna get the
same ultra high level of soreness
and it's not gonna work well for you i
did this for an entire like two
mesocycles one time when i was like i
don't know 33 this was like a couple of
years ago or some shit i'm like 36 now
recording this video so i was being an
idiot i was like having these amazing
leg workouts but the second workout of
the week was
super fucked up but i had to be super
light because i was just overdoing it i
was getting crazy doms like
five days later i still have painful
doms um
i remember tracking my performance which
we'll get to in the next video
and like looking at like pictures and uh
trying to figure stuff out and i
realized like i hadn't grown my quads in
two fucking months
two months of no quad growth while i was
training harder than ever trained before
wax i was doing too much
and i wasn't backing off at the time i
was struggling with the idea that
my stimulus to fatigue ratio was getting
so good i was getting such a great
muscle connection i didn't need 10 sets
of quads anymore to get a great workout
i needed more like five or six
and i was still doing like seven or
eight be like there's no way like i have
to do this
bullshit if you can't recover on time to
have other great workouts because you're
too weak or you're too sore
you have to reduce your volume in order
to get good progress period
all right that's it i sure as hell
finished on a fiery note
see you next time when we talk about the
next potential regulator
of your volume which is going to be
performance see you next week
you
