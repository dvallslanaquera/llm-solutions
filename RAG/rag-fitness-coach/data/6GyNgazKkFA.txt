a common question i get is should i take
creatine during a cut
the answer is yes the same benefits you
get from creatine during a bulk such as
increased strength hypertrophy and power
gains you will also get during a cut
that said just being with supplementing
with creatine can cause your wings to go
up by one to three percent in the first
couple of months so keep that in mind
when assessing your weigh-ins
