previously at the house of hypertrophy
we saw the scientific literature
strongly indicates a wide range of rep
numbers are similarly effective for
muscle hypertrophy
provided those reps are performed to or
close to failure
per set
6 to 35 reps are likely similar
3 to 5 reps may be less efficient per
set so need extra sets to see similar
hypertrophy to fewer sets with more reps
though these different rep numbers
produce similar hypertrophy magnitudes
do they differ in the exact type of
hypertrophy evoked
it's hypothesized certain rep ranges
promote denser appearing muscles while
others produce puffy appearing muscles
the idea of density and puffy muscles
comes down to how muscle fibers grow
there are three different ways a muscle
fiber can technically grow
before detailing them we must understand
the muscle fibers contain myofibrils
myofibrils contain the contractile
machinery that generates a muscle's
force
growth of the myofibrils via increases
in numbers or size of pre-existing ones
will benefit strength as this means more
contractile machinery to generate force
aside from myofibrils everything else in
the muscle fiber can be considered the
sarcoplasm
the sarcoplasm is largely water but also
houses other components like glycogen
sarcoplasmic proteins and
non-contractile organelles
of course growth of the sarcoplasm alone
does nothing for strength capacities
one way muscle fibers grow is through
the myofibrils and sarcoplasm growing at
the same rate
this is called myofibrillar hypertrophy
another way is through the myofibrils
growing at a faster rate than the
sarcoplasm
this is called myofibrillar packing
for this video i'm going to merge
together my fibula hypertrophy and
myofibrillar packing and collectively
refer to them under the term myofibular
hypertrophy
the similarity between the two is they
involve significant myofibril growth
the third and final way muscle fibers
can grow is through the sarcoplasm
growing at a faster rate than the
myofibrils
this is called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
it's thought myofibular hypertrophy
creates a denser muscle appearance while
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy creates a
puffier appearance
as we noted it hypothesized certain rep
ranges could target my fibula or
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy more
some broadly believe lower reps produce
myofibril hypertrophy while higher reps
produce sarcoplasmic hypertrophy others
refer to comparisons between
bodybuilders and weightlifters or
powerlifters for example the very
popular book the science and practice of
strength training suggests elite
weightlifters see my fibula hypertrophy
while bodybuilders see sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy
of course
weight lifters and power lifters tend to
train with five or fewer reps while
bodybuilders with eight to 15 reps
in this video we'll address both
arguments how do muscle fiber
adaptations compare between lower and
higher reps as well as bodybuilders and
power athletes
certain scientific literature suggests
rep ranges may influence the type of
fiber hypertrophy evoked
a 2015 study from england compared
muscle fiber characteristics from the
vastus lateralis between 12 bodybuilders
6 power athletes and 14 untrained
subjects
the power athletes were american
football players track and field
athletes and weightlifters they were
broadly described as training high
intensity
the bodybuilders diaries revealed they
mostly trained with eight to 15 reps
it was found the specific tension of the
bodybuilder's fibers was 62 percent
lower than the power athletes and 41
lower versus the untrained subjects
the obvious question here is what on
earth is specific tension
it measures the force a muscle fiber can
produce per unit of its cross-sectional
area
remember the myofibrils in the muscle
fiber are essentially what produces
force
so specific tension fundamentally
measures how much of a fiber is taken up
by myofibrils
so as the bodybuilders had lower
specific tension versus the power
athletes and control subjects
their muscle fibers contained lower
myofibril amounts per cross-sectional
area unit
indirectly this implies their fibers
contain more sarcoplasm potentially
suggesting they've experienced
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy whereas the
power athletes more so my fibula
hypertrophy
another 2008 study from japan compared
elite bodybuilders to elite
weightlifters
the bodybuilders have larger triceps
cross-sectional areas and produced the
greater overall triceps isometric force
however
the ratio of triceps cross-sectional
area to isometrics triceps force was
lower in the bodybuilders
put another weight per cross-sectional
area unit the bodybuilder's triceps were
weaker than the weight lifters
out of many possible explanations one is
the bodybuilder's triceps just contained
a lower my fibal amounts and greater
sarcoplasm space versus the weight
lifters in other words they've
experienced sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
the researchers also found in both the
bodybuilders and weightlifters there was
a correlation between triceps
cross-sectional area and triceps
isometric force
but the correlation was slightly
stronger in the weight lifters
this stronger correlation may be because
their tricep size contains a higher
myofibril amount versus the bodybuilders
that is
they've experienced myofibrillar
hypertrophy creating the more precise
relationship between their muscle size
and strength
we also have an array of other studies
establishing in powerlifters
specifically there are strong
relationships between measures of muscle
mass and their strength on the bench
press squat and deadlift
this would suggest the power lifters
muscle size presumably consists of a ton
of myofibrils perhaps attained via
myofibril hypertrophy causing the strong
relationship to strength
a final piece of evidence comes from a
2010 study from canada which compared
four sets of repetitions to failure with
either a ninety percent or one rate max
load or thirty percent one rep max load
of course
the thirty percent one rate max load
achieved way more repetitions across
sets
24 hours after the session
sarcoplasmic protein synthesis was
greater for the thirty percent condition
this very indirectly suggests the thirty
percent one red max load may produce
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
as one thing that could cause
disproportionate sarcoplasm growth
is an increase in sarcoplasmic proteins
that draw in additional water into the
fiber
so the data we've overviewed suggests
bodybuilding training may cause
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy while power
lifting or weightlifting may cause
myofibular hypertrophy
also
higher reps may produce sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy over lower reps
a number of notable limitations exist
with the studies just assessed
in the english study that found to lower
specific tension in bodybuilders and the
japanese study finding a lower ratio of
triceps size to strength in bodybuilders
anabolic steroids could be a confounder
both studies involved high-level
competitive bodybuilders in fact the
english study noted that 9 of the 12
bodybuilders involved admitted to
anabolic steroids usage
this matters as it's very possible
independent of rep ranges and overall
training
anabolic steroids may increase the
occurrence of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
unfortunately i'm not aware of any
science that can truly validate this
but in the words of greg knuckles from
stronger by science a lot of people
report gaining a lot of weight very
quickly when they go on steroids
much more than could be explained by
plain old microbial hypertrophy and
losing it very quickly when they come
off
likely indicating shifts in the amount
of water they're storing
another limitation with the english and
japanese studies is causation cannot
necessarily be drawn
remember they just compared muscle fiber
properties between bodybuilders and
power athletes at one time point
they cannot truly suggest the
bodybuilder's training caused the
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy signs
it remains possible the bodybuilders in
these studies even way back before they
even began training
just had lower specific tension or lower
size to strength ratios
finally with the study finding greater
sarcoplasmic protein synthesis 24 hours
after training with a 30 percent versus
a 90 or one rep max load it's just a
short-term measurement
in the absence of long-term measures it
cannot prove greater sarcoplasmic
protein synthesis rates actually
translate into measurable sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy
furthermore the study actually found
that four hours after the training
session sarcoplasmic protein synthesis
rates were created for the 90 or one rep
max condition
so
it's clear the current data suggesting
rep ranges can modulate the type of
muscle fiber growth experienced is
notably limited
do we have any better quality evidence
we do indeed and this evidence may
suggest rep ranges do not influence the
type of muscle fiber growth experienced
[Music]
we have an array of long-term studies
directly finding my fibula hypertrophy
here's a summary of them
notice how all of them involve training
with largely 7 to 12 repetitions
these rep numbers are what bodybuilders
commonly train with
now this doesn't mean fewer reps don't
produce myfib hypertrophy
it's just no research has longitudinally
explored this
in any case
this is pretty strong evidence classic
bodybuilding rep ranges do not
preferentially produce sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy
what about higher rep numbers we have
some interesting research here too
per set
6 to 35 reps are probably similarly
effective for muscle hypertrophy
provided those reps are performed to or
close to failure yet
strength gains as measured by one rep
max on an exercise always tend to be
better with the lower rep numbers and
thus heavier loads
for example we've partly overviewed this
2015 study from new york in other videos
they had trained men perform three sets
per exercise
hypertrophy outcomes were similar
between training with 8 to 12 and 25 to
35 reps to failure per set
yet bench press and squat strength
adaptations were created for the 8 to 12
rep group
some may speculate that given 25 to 35
reps produced similar muscle size gains
to 8 to 12 reps but lower strength gains
the 25 to 35 reps may not be increasing
myofibril amounts as much and hence must
be producing sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
the problem with this speculation
however
is it ignores other factors besides my
fibro growth that may contribute to one
rep max strength
a one rep max is a skill
there's evidence with the same exercise
the precise technique and muscle
recruitment patterns used differ between
using light and heavier loads
thus
training with heavier loads would better
develop your one rep max skill and
specialized neural adaptations compared
to lighter loads resultantly in the new
york study finding greater warning max
strength gains with 8 to 12 versus 25 to
35 reps
part of this is likely attributable to
25 to 35 reps producing lowest skill and
specialized neural adaptations versus 8
to 12 reps
so we cannot be certain the lower one
rep max strength gains with 25 to 35
reps have anything to do with
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
as opposed to measuring one rep max
strength
testing isometric strength may be better
in our context
isometric strength tests involve a much
lower skill component
thus allowing us to better compare how
increases in myofibril content compare
between light and heavier low training
when looking at the data that has done
this as summarized by a 2017 meta
analysis out of new york
isometric strength gains end up being
similar between light and heavier low
training
in this case the heavier low training
largely involved 8 to 12 repetitions to
failure per set while the lighter load
training involved 20 to 35 repetitions
to failure per set
now i know many people don't call 8-12
reps heavy training but for our purposes
here we're just noting 8-12 reps is
heavier training versus 20-35 reps to
failure
nevertheless
this data would suggest that 20 to 35
reps are increasing myofibril content
just as effectively to 8 to 12 reps
furthermore recall many long-term
studies find that 7 to 12 rep range is
associated with myofibril hypertrophy
so extrapolating this and we can infer
that 20 to 35 reps are also producing
myofibrillar hypertrophy
summarizing this section
the stronger evidence outlined provides
good grounds to infer different rep
ranges may not produce different types
of muscle fiber growths
it appears a wide range of rep numbers
can produce myofibular hypertrophy
[Music]
here's a table of all the current
long-term studies finding sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy
notice how three of the five used high
volumes defined as performing 21 or more
weekly sets per muscle group for example
one of the studies by mcdougall involved
training with a minimum of 27 cents for
the triceps per week
another study involved training the
quadriceps with 36 sets per week
returning to the studies finding
myofibril hypertrophy
notice how non-used high volumes rather
low to moderate volumes
consequently
high volumes may be what drives
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
i still advise caution in this
conclusion as only three studies find an
association between high volumes and
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
however if higher volumes do cause
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy this could
explain the findings of earlier papers
we assessed
remember the english and japanese
studies finding bodybuilders showed
potential signs of sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy had notable limitations
but it's also possible those
bodybuilders trained with high volumes
explaining their sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy indicators rather than rep
ranges per se
in any event
future research is still needed to truly
establish if higher volumes cause
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
i also want to mention with the studies
finding sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
except in one of them the magnitudes of
relative sarcoplasm expansion were
largely not that much for example
in the mcdougall study involving at
least 27 sets for the triceps per week
although the triceps fiber
cross-sectional area increased by 23
percent
the relative space taken up by the
myofibrils in the fibers decreased by
two percent only
this indirectly indicates the sarcoplasm
took up two percent more relative space
i'm skeptical this small added relative
space taken up by the sarcoplasm would
manifest as more puffy looking muscles
so in the real world and particularly
for naturals i don't think sarcoplasmic
hypertrophy is necessarily an aesthetic
worry
the degree of sarcoplasm relative
expansion may just be trivial but again
more research is certainly needed on
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy overall
including examinations of the magnitudes
of sarcoplasm expansion
[Music]
in summary the scientific research one
may use to suggest rep ranges
preferentially cause my fibula or
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy has very
notable limitations
much stronger evidence suggests that rep
ranges may not impact what muscle fiber
growth is experienced in fact this data
seems to suggest a wide range of rep
numbers can produce myofibrillar
hypertrophy
finally some preliminary evidence
indicates rather than rep ranges higher
volume training may be what causes
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
