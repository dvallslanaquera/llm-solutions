welcome back it's been a while since i
last recorded one of these
long story short i've been on holidays
and i've been
busy with traveling and relaxing a
little bit and so
making one of these taking a back seat
now today i wanted to discuss how the
holidays went both training and dieting
wise
some dye strategies while on holidays
how heat impacts training and finally
how my prep has gone since the last
contest prep video
so first up reviewing how the holidays
went training and dining wise
the holidays were enjoyable
i went to greece
more specifically crete for
nine days i think
the traveling was a bit stressful
the first flight to get there was
at 9am or 8am or something which
required me to wake up quite early and
then the flight back was at um
1am till 5am so it wasn't ideal
sleep-wise
but
otherwise the holidays were quite
relaxing i definitely managed to unplug
a little bit from
work and i came back from it
wanting to work again
so i think it accomplished its
objective or aim quite well
now regarding how
holidays impacted training and dieting
first up training because that's the
less
um complicated one i guess
so training wise i stuck to my program
as much as i could
it was my week three slash week four
of my message cycle so pretty hard weeks
volume wise and
approximately value-wise i was trading
at rp 8 or 9 or one or two upstairs have
and volume is pretty high
i stuck to it pretty much perfectly with
the exception of certain
exercise replacements so for example i
switched
deficit assuming that lifts for split
squats and for example for rdls i didn't
use a deficit as you'll see later on in
the video
just because the gym didn't really have
any
any
equipment that would make for a good
deficit and so you you know you have to
make do sometimes and i adjust things a
little bit
but overall i think i got pretty good
training again given the circumstances
and training wasn't really an issue
um it wasn't ideal but for a week and a
half it was definitely good enough
especially given
how much volume i was doing and
how low stress was and just training
pretty hard overall
you know if you're training enough and
training sufficiently hard and
recovering fairly well overall
the exact machine you're using doesn't
matter a whole lot for a patch fee
obviously there are differences between
machines and certain machines are better
but it's a detail compared to
the broader strokes and the bigger
picture
now diet wise
the holidays also went surprisingly well
so going into the holidays i
i was aiming to enjoy myself
and diet wise or weight wise i was
aiming to
be somewhere between
the usual rate weight loss so around
half kilograms per kilogram a week
and maintenance as long as i wasn't
gaining any weight because it's only
ultimately the holidays only last 10
days or nine days and so even if i
maintain for nine days cool it's a diet
break i enjoyed myself i had some good
food i relaxed
uh that wouldn't have been the end of
the world but at the same time if i
could lose some weight whilst i enjoyed
myself that was also welcome
and so i sort of set those two
boundaries as being
either i lose the same weight as usual
or i maintain anywhere between those two
boundaries is fine
what ended up happening i didn't really
have access to a scale while then and i
didn't really track my macros
like most of the restaurants for example
i went
to
didn't have
nutritional information or macros and so
i had to
either estimate based on previous
tracking experience
or just
eat according to society and hope for
the best
um
i would say around half the days i was
there
i tracked most of my food i made an
attempt to estimate macros
and then maybe the other half i
mostly went off satiety and made some
reasonable choices and ate intuitively
um so sort of a combination of intuitive
eating
tracking some stuff and basing my eating
off of um
sensible decisions and
again eating according to hunger
so
what happened was i didn't have access
to a weight scale so i didn't weigh
myself during holidays except for once
we had access to the weight scale of a
friend of mine
and
when i left the uk before my holidays i
was around
94.5 kilograms 95 i believe actually no
i was more like
96 i think 96 yeah
um but then when i weighed myself over
there
i was kind of expecting myself to be at
least 96.
it turns out i weighed in at 94 after
having some food in the morning
and so i was like okay
did i just lose two kilograms in like a
week
while on holidays
um
which
in the end that wasn't the case
turns out because while on holidays
typically your caloric density is a bit
higher than usual
i was having less food weight than usual
um so i didn't really lose two kilograms
but i definitely still lost some weight
while on holidays and so i came back to
the uk
and weighed around maybe a kilogram or a
kilogram and a half less than where i
left
and so ultimately i did lose
you know some good fat while i was on
holidays now the way i did that was
again i outline my strategy as far as
tracking and everything goes but what i
would typically do most days and i
mentioned this on instagram i believe
was i would have one or two meals per
day be quite protein heavy so an example
would be like eh too small store-bought
protein shakes which would have like 50
grams of protein total with 300 calories
and then for a second meal for example
i'd have
fat-free chocolate milk which would have
25 grams of protein and 25 carbs for 200
calories and then for the remaining
usually
one or two meals a day most usually two
i would go out to a restaurant with
friends or what have you and
either try and estimate the calories in
the macros or
just essentially eat this tidy and not
be too concerned with calories because
by that point i'd have had like
seven to 800 calories for the whole day
and my cutting macros were around 3 200
calories
so i had a big margin to make up for um
but yeah also staying quite busy during
the holidays helped with
making sure i didn't
overeat because i was busy enough that i
wasn't concerned about eating all the
time and sometimes i'd go six seven
hours without eating
in fact while traveling back
because the flight was delayed
and
i didn't have time to get food before
the flight and when i got
off the flight i was in london gatwick
and if you know anything about learn
gatwick um there's not a whole lot
around that place
and so the nearest supermarket at 3am
was a 50-minute walk
and so eventually what happened is i
didn't eat for 20 hours straight
which wasn't ideal but it means you know
makes cutting a bit easier i guess
um
now i wanted to discuss briefly
what diet strategies i recommend while
people are in holidays
i think diet strategy is essentially
falling continuum from
no restriction at all to
extreme restriction
and where you're gonna wanna fall on
that continuum depends on your goals
in my case
i fell more towards the
unrestricted end
while i do have pretty serious goals
like as i'm competing in bodybuilding in
nine and a half weeks now
at the same time
i also have a lot of tracking experience
i'm pretty good with
hunger management and intuitive eating
so in my case it makes sense to be more
so towards the unrestricted end
counter example let's say someone was
three weeks out from charley and they
struggled with humor management majorly
they didn't have much tracking
experience
and
again they're competing in three weeks
in that case
being a lot more restricted makes a lot
more sense
but then there's also a counter example
there for example when
let's say you're someone who has no
plans of competing
you go on holidays once a year for a
week once a year for a week here
i don't
see a particularly good reason for you
to really restrict yourself especially
food is a pretty
important part of life to you you may as
well enjoy yourself uh not be too
concerned about what you're eating for a
week and then come back and you can take
it more seriously once you're back
because most people ultimately go on
holidays to enjoy themselves and relax
and
worrying about your food intake can be a
bit detrimental so it really depends on
i would say your goals your experience
how you deal with hunger
how good your intuitive eating
what food choices you have available
because sometimes you know in greece for
example
most things didn't have nutritional
information so even if i wanted to be
really restrictive and track everything
i wouldn't have been able to anyways so
i think the exact bad approach you adopt
should depend on your context
circumstances and so forth
next i want to discuss how heat impacts
training you might notice in some of
these clips i am quite sweaty
um
that is because this gym for example
didn't have ac so it didn't have air
conditioning
which is not ideal
for various reasons
on a more practical level
being sweaty and
having sweaty hands etc
just makes training a bit less safe most
likely because stuff like dumbbells slip
around your hands
uh you slip around on the floor
it's just not very enjoyable
on a more physiological level though um
heat while training is generally a bad
a bad thing at least in a short time
so your body takes at least a few days
to a few weeks
to acclimate to more heat
so i'm for example used to training in
an ac
air conditioning gym
which has around a temperature of 20
degrees celsius
for my body to get used to training in
35 degrees celsius with no ac
it would likely take a few days or a few
weeks and during that time you would see
a different performance and that's been
shown in
at least adjusted in several studies now
from insurance training to
other types of training
so long story short
your body takes a few days to a few
weeks to acclimate to heat and to higher
temperatures
and during that time you can expect to
see a dip performance
so if you're going on holidays and
you're training in the heat which you're
not used to
then i wouldn't expect your performance
to be quite as good as usual just a
heads up
what you can do to combat this is you
know
effective hydration so make sure you
drink plenty of water especially cold
water helps
uh because that can decrease your body
temperature somewhat
um
then
ideally if you have a fan or ac
definitely use that
but otherwise you just sort of have to
accept a slight decrement performance
for a while um you could also use stuff
like electrolytes in your beverages to
increase hydration a little bit but the
main thing is just going to be time
spent training in heat and the more you
do it the more acclimated your body gets
to it
and the better performance becomes
finally to end up this video end off end
up close enough
i wanted to discuss how my prep has gone
since
i came back from greece
honestly since i came back so during the
whole of holidays i didn't really
experience much hunger
it didn't feel like an issue
since then however i've come back i've
gotten back into the swing of things for
a week now
hunger has been more of an issue
and
my
energy motivation to train and be
physically active has dropped
quite steeply
which is kind of to be expected and i'm
surprised it took this long because i'm
now as i said 65 days out or nine and a
half weeks out
so
you know it's good that it took this
long for me to feel this way but now i'm
starting i think to feel the effects of
prepping
um the good news is i only have
nine and a half weeks to go so
i should be able to get through it just
fine
the bad news is um
it's still
nine and a half weeks to go
now i don't want to read too much into
this because
a few bad days doesn't mean
much in the grand scheme of things and
it could just be a temporary thing for a
few days you have a few bad days and
then you're back to normal
but for now i've gotten back to the
swing of things i'm working a lot more
in my phd i've gotten a lot of work done
on phd
um
as i said going on holidays has sort of
renewed my focus and my motivation to
work a little bit
so
i've done a lot of work my phd been a
lot more scheduled and planned out
and been using a lot more caffeine as
well i used to not take caffeine at all
now i'm up to
400 milligrams a day
which for me is a lot um
i use it primarily to enhance my work
and to give me energy
and sort of
give me a better mood to be working i
guess
and also prep i imagine has made me more
reliant on it where beforehand i would
be able to
be physically active get my steps in and
work just fine without caffeine but now
caffeine does definitely help
additionally caffeine might suppress
appetite to a very small extent and
maybe increase energy expenditure a
little bit
not to a
great extent but it's a small effect but
it's still an effect so i'll take it
and i've managed to time it properly
such that it doesn't really impact my
sleep
i take caffeine when i wake up and i
take caffeine around
nine hours before i go to bed
anyways that about wraps up this video
