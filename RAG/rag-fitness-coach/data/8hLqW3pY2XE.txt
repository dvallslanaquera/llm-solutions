press go
go go go
not bad not bad at all

i'm clearly dr mike this is joe
valentine he is also from michigan
actually he's from a part of michigan
that
i'm gonna guess eminem is his favorite
artist of all time
is that true no all right well that was
my guest for the day
joe is a high school
national level power lifter when i was
in high school i didn't know shit
existed but look at those pecs of course
he's at that level he's also a track and
field athlete
but today we are training pecs
there's a lot of pec to train
you feeling good feeling good hell yeah
let's get after it
[Music]
three exercises today the first exercise
is going to be the cambered bar bench
super awesome because it gives you an
awesome stretch at the bottom which
probably promotes a lot of growth the
thing with the camber bench is very
difficult to access most people don't
have this bar but when you get a chance
make sure to warm up slow make sure to
pause the benches at the bottom because
the forces are super high and also
understand that the load you're going to
be using
is probably going to be way smaller than
the one you do for the regular bench
because the range of motion is hugely
extended by like three or four inches
get it do it
but
in addition to that it's extended at the
range of motion in which you are not the
strongest so the load's going to come
down a ton make sure to stay safe
for the record joe's best competition
bench with a pause
is right around 300 pounds
so notice how much weight we're going to
end up using for working sets it won't
be anywhere near that because this is a
hard exercise but it beats your pecs to
death speaking of death let's do the
first step
one that was perfect
two
three
[Music]
four these are great
five couple more chest up
six one more
[Music]
oh yeah one more trust up
you got this joke
up
up
up
wrap up oh yeah
way to kick that last one
good stuff oh yeah
that was a real grinder
chest up
good
[Music]
perfect
[Music]
excellent
good one more chest up
up up up one more you got this let's go
joe
press go
go go go
rack
not bad not bad at all no
six reps i helped a little on the last
one so usually when it's five as the
last rep probably gonna be like four or
five in the next one we're gonna drop
the weight down a little bit which is
good practice because anything over five
reps is probably best for muscle growth
under five reps is better for strength
we're gonna go to like this is 185
notice 185 for a 300 pound venture he's
probably typically not doing 185 for
five on the regular bench you're doing
225 plus right so humbling exercise
we're gonna go down to like 165 and do
one more working set cool awesome all
right
set it up chest up
beautiful one
[Music]
two
three steady
four couple more
[Music]
all right one more stop
good stuff
that was really good yeah you got a pump
yet oh i got a pump hell yeah that's
just the beginning
all righty let's put the weights back
and get into our next exercise
[Music]
all right
cambered bar bench
sets of five to ten reps three of them
actually great heavy stimulus now it's
time to do some flies isolate the chest
a bit later we'll do another compound to
do the compound isolation sandwich that
we actually have a video about maybe
scott the video guy will link it this is
going to be in the 10 to 20 rep range as
usual whole range of motion is critical
we're going to be pausing at the bottom
you don't have to in this it's not a
terrible idea and just remember
that if you lean forward into the
movement you can often use more weight
and not have this weird balancing should
happen let's do it
easy huh rack
strong ass chest god damn what are they
feeding these high school kids nowadays
i'm just gonna go up another
couple notches
relax for a bit then we'll go again okay
ten keep it going stable
eleven good
twelve good let's see if we get to
fifteen
thirteen
fourteen good technique one more slow
chest up
coming together go go go go go go slow

[Music]
seven good way to squeeze one more slow
everything good technique squeeze
slow on the way down
rack
good stuff
good stuff
very good we're gonna take the weight
down just a bit for your next set so you
can get a few more reps quick tutorial
some of you have damned me on
snapchat don't go googling i don't have
a snapchat but in any case that happened
and you're like dr mike how
is it did i change weight
and my clip stack would also attract the
attention of a significant other
here's how to do it right
just uh well i didn't mean to i'll i'll
go this way not that i'm not attracted
to you
right clip the chump way to do it and be
like oh hey what's up stacy oh not much
i'm just working out
don't do that nobody's getting laid like
that
here's how you do it you're like what's
up stacy
load the ham stacy fucking knows
biomechanics she always does
just like that open up open up open up
change
pop back up stacey's just gonna be like
here's my number and you're like people
write down numbers
you throw her number away fucking walk
off boom
oh yeah
[Music]
keep going
[Music]
oh yeah one more one more
finish strong
good technique
oh shit one more
close and then slow
perfect oh yeah
packs are pumped pockets are pumped even
more pumped more pumps
all right folks
joe is doing great one more exercise
that is going to be dips
earlier joe said he could quote do a lot
of dips now that he has no functional
chest anymore let's see how that works
and we walk over to the dip station i'll
give you guys a couple of modification
techniques to get the most
spectacular
dip setup they're not all funny jokes
all right youtube
so dips
dad did him grandpa did him great
grandpa hated him great great grandpa
invented the dip
how do we get the most out of dips for
triceps and or for chest there's some
real rocket science shit gonna be coming
in here for triceps
you want to take a closer grip
which because i'm larger than average
this is as close of grip as i can take
if you are fucking enormous this could
be your close grip you just have to play
around and see
and
when you let your feet sag down you want
to point them forward and keep your
upper body upright so that at the bottom
of the dip you actually have an elbow
angle that looks a lot like this versus
like that
if you are
on the smaller end of things you can
even go and dip this way and if you were
like i don't know a fucking
eight-year-old you could grab all the
way over here
for pecs
two modifications
wider grip but not so wide that your
shoulders feel funny we don't want that
and what you want to do for pecs is you
take your feet and you tuck them under
you which allows you to lean forward
more and blast your pecs
not a great all-around pec exercise
because it preferentially stimulates the
lower fibers and leaves the clavicular
out but damn good lower pack exercise
and a great way to finish off especially
if you're pretty strong
so we're gonna find out how strong joe
is maybe he'll need some weight maybe he
won't
let's get into it
slow on the way down pause the deepest
stretch possible and a full lockout
every time cool cool all right
one
two little deeper still
oh yeah
three now we're going
[Music]
four
[Music]
six oh yeah
slow control deep
seven couple more
chest up
[Music]
oh yeah one more joe let's go deep
[Music]
one last one what do you think
try it fuck it try it deep
up
go go go
amazing amazing
that's that one
you could probably do like 30 dibs fresh
huh probably yes yeah
[Music]
three
[Music]
for fuck yeah
up
five that's it that's it that's it one
more one more fuck it go
[Music]
oh shit
that's it way to finish way to finish
good stuff
wow shit i didn't think that was going
to happen
how are your pecs feeling dead that is
excellent
how many push-ups can you do
a bunch a bunch yeah so right after
the set of dips
i want you to walk over
to right here
medium grip push-up position
butt lift it up
you're gonna touch your chest to the
ground gently full lockout
slow touch gently full lockout you can
stare in the mirror at yourself
and uh as many push-ups but minimum
break as soon as you're here go here
whenever you're ready joe
[Music]
deep much deeper
yes
[Music]
good
[Music]
good
chest up
good just like that deep slow
up
oh yeah one more
[Music]
one more you got this
you got this
up
up
right over
begin slow
up
one keep that butt up
up
two
[Music]
yeah yeah yeah
dude
good stuff thank you yeah
that's the whole workout we tried to
make him breathe heavy and throw up but
he's a track and field athlete and a
wrestler
that just just wasn't gonna happen i
think the takeaway is there's
bodybuilders and there's real athletes
see you guys next time
[Music]
you
