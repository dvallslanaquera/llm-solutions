hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's quick tip
is about how to determine your rest time
between sets for strength training
and
oftentimes uh for strength and
hypertrophy training
very very similar mostly we're going to
talk about muscle growth rest times but
for strength that's almost identical
i'll make sure to point that out to you
so
here is the answer it's three minutes
that's it
see you guys next
time all right so not really there's
still more video so i guess i gotta fill
it with something
funny enough we have a variety of these
videos actually now um how long to rest
and every now and again as someone who
clearly has not watched the video will
log on as you guys know is common with
youtube and we'll just type in it's
three minutes like there's literally a
comment out there like that
and it's like holy shit get out the
nobel prize ceremony my man you just
discovered you know something better
than quantum mechanics it
a lot of times this is as far as you get
recommendations are just like in
just certain lengths of time let's say
like
you know one minute
two minutes you know one and a half
minutes for isolation two minutes two
and a half for compound blah blah blah
stuff like that
there are some decent heuristics out
there
but the problem is that they don't have
a way
to test against real-world scenarios so
you have a heuristic that says hey
one minute for isolations two minute for
compounds
and then the real world shows up and
it's like what if i'm
really big over 250 pounds what if i'm
really small i'm under 115 pounds i'm
female
and like when i rest two minutes i just
stand around for a minute and 30 seconds
completely ready to go again but
apparently it says two minutes is that
really two minutes for me and the guy
that's still out of breath and gasping
for air after two minutes is the
is there a purpose to while we're
resting or is this something magical
going on inside the body that just takes
two minutes no matter who you are the
answer is that's bullshit the answer is
the body's quite complex so we need a
rule set in which we can derive rest
times in any place we are luckily that
rule set is so simple that's actually
better to know this than even the
heuristics of like a minute here two
minutes there we can wipe that shit all
like all the way clean
and let you guys in on a secret
just four ways and they're super simple
four little check boxes you have to go
through in your mind and as soon as
you've checked all four you know if it's
time to keep resting or if rest time is
over and you're good to go again
so here we are
the checklist goes as follows number one
if you're in the gym to build strength
or build muscle
the first thing you should ask yourself
is am i still out of breath
if you still like that
then your cardiovascular system is going
to be the limiting factor on the next
set question do you go into the gym to
lift weights to build up your
cardiovascular system as your number one
priority no you do not you're building
up your muscular system or your
neuromuscular system if you happen to be
strength training
so if your cardiovascular system is
still limiting factor which is exactly
what is being evident
when you are breathing super heavy you
are not ready to go again and you should
rest longer in almost every circumstance
all right so still out of breath don't
go yet
next one
ask yourself do i feel strong
and ready to hit the muscle hard again
if you just did a set of five in squat
training super hard you rack the bar
you guys know what i'm talking about you
have this profound feeling of total body
weakness
especially weakness in your leg and as
soon as you sit down
take a few breaths have a little bit of
a drink you sort of feel out your legs
and you're like hell no i can barely
stand up or like yeah i don't feel
strong at all now a few minutes later
maybe less maybe more you get that gusto
back
you're like man
it's time to hit it our training
partner's like hey you're ready you're
like you know what i am freaking ready i
am ready i feel strong again
up here and in my target muscles like
i'm ready to do shit
as soon as you feel that that box has
been checked before you feel that don't
go yet because it's too soon we want to
push the muscle in hypertrophy training
close to failure close to its own limits
and if you feel so
out of it and so weak and so
systemically fatigued that you can't
drive that muscle hard don't bother you
need more rest that's the fucking
purpose of rest anyway is to make your
next set a good set if you're too tired
to make it a good set don't do it right
that's like if your friends ask you like
after a 50-hour long work day we'll go
with that
crazy work do you just finish like 10
projects you can barely keep your eyes
open and barely stay upright your
friend's like dude you want to go to the
club for five hours the correct answer
is no you may make bad decisions in your
life and say yes and then fall asleep on
one of the club chairs or the couches
and the bouncers throw you out the
reality is no you are not recovered
enough to go to the club and have a good
time so you go to the club use fifty
dollars for the door fee another extra
hundred dollars for the bouncer you know
i'm being good with the bouncing staff
25 a drink all this other bullshit at
the end of the day if you're gonna be
putting in that money in five hours of
fucking time you might as well be like
up for it ready have plenty of energy
plenty of being awake plenty of focus
and plenty of desire to party sometimes
you don't want a party you don't feel
like that shit you're like i just feel
like netflix and if you are not
recovered enough yet from the week to
really feel like you're you're your shit
anymore don't go party same idea with
the next step next set needs to be a
party you need to be there a good set is
a set where you're there psychologically
you'll feel ready don't go
a few seconds later a few minutes later
you'll feel better you'll be ready to go
point number three
ask yourself
is the target muscle or muscles are they
going to be the limiting factors for
this next set or is there a muscle
that's a synergist
that is a stabilizing muscle that is
going to get at me first and limit my
set for example if you've just done lat
pull downs
your lats feel good you're not out of
breath you feel fucking strong
but your forearms are still on fire
don't go again yet wait until you've
shaken them out and massaged them out
and they're good because if you go that
next set of lat pull downs
almost certainly be stopped because you
can't grip the bar anymore and while you
took your grip to failure sweet your
forms will get bigger not the goal of
the exercise
your back muscles which were the goal of
the exercise to target they may be five
or ten reps away from failure because
that's how tired your grip was it acted
as a huge limiting factor
if you're about to squat again for your
quads and your lower back is still on
fire bro we don't squat for our fucking
lower back it's nice benefit side
benefit but if your quad's in another
five reps and your lower back says rack
the bar that next head is going to suck
even if you feel strong make sure
there's no limiting factor muscles that
aren't the target muscle themselves
and lastly that's three points point
number four
is the target muscle itself has to be
recovered enough and and feel good
enough to do like on average for
hypertrophy training
at least five reps
and
for strength training that muscle should
be good to hit at least as many reps as
your target is
right so in hypertrophy training is
especially easy to illustrate
if you just did
a set of six in the bicep curl
still very hypertrophic
if you rested a few minutes and you're
like i feel good psychologically
no limiting factors i'm not quite
energized yet enough to i think do five
i know how tired i am i'm gonna be able
to do like four good reps
that's fine
but mostly the research literature has
shown
that you get your best muscle growth
from sets of five reps to 30 reps and
sets of one two three and even maybe
four up sometimes just aren't enough
volume it's not enough time spent
generating tension by your muscles to
count as a real set enough of one set
enough work done
that's a sets worth of work compared to
other sets like sets of 10 and 15 and
eight and stuff like that
so if you need a little bit extra time
to make sure you can get at least five
reps per set for hypertrophy and for
sure if like you have a set of three
coming up in deadlifts
if someone's like you feel pretty good
you're like yeah good enough to do
another triple you're like not that good
i could do a single fucking rest longer
right
so as long as you can hit the target
reps that you want which is five or more
hypertrophy or whatever rep range you
chose
and you know whatever rep target you
have for that strength set coming up
then you're good to go but remember it's
all the boxes so anytime you sit down
after a set of squats or benches or
whatever
ask yourself before
you're saying okay i'm ready to go again
or if a training partner asks you hey
you ready to go again you're ready for
your next set you're okay am i out of
breath yes no
do i feel strong and ready to really hit
it hard yes no is there another muscle
group that's going to cramp me up or
limit me that's not my target muscle
group or target group of the movement
yes no and then lastly am i going to be
able to actually do the number of reps
that i want to make that set productive
prop there's a probability estimate like
yeah pretty much or no definitely not
i'll tell you what the no definitely
knots are much easier to detect so if
you detect those for sure don't fucking
go
now the way this plays out
is
if you've checked the boxes you can rest
longer
but you're good to go for essentially
your maximum productivity set as soon as
you're ready to go which means different
sets under different circumstances for
different people can be wildly different
answers
which i'll come back around closing out
this video to sort of illustrate to you
how this checklist which is the really
truly valid way to determine rest times
can come up with very different answers
that don't fall into that like one to
two minutes bruh which are it's a fine
answer but not as good
if we have a power lifter who weighs 280
pounds and he's doing a set of eight in
the squat for hypertrophy work
he may not
be
back to normal breathing feeling strong
not having a lower back cramp and being
able to do another set of eight for five
to seven minutes after his last set easy
whereas if you have a female who's 110
pounds and she's training her calves
precisely five seconds after her last
set of calves
she was actually never out of breath
feeling nice and strong to do another
set of calves
no muscles in the calf raise exercise
that limit you other than your calves
that number three disappears altogether
and she got a set of 12 on her last set
of calf races and she feels golden to go
again
and she knows on the set before that she
rested also five seconds she got 16 reps
so it's 16 reps then 12 reps like it's
not gonna be four
it's gonna be like maybe 10 or 11 maybe
eight or nine
that's all the boxes checked and that
means five seconds of rest can literally
be enough to do another productive set
if you just say two to three minutes for
everyone what happens powerlifter guy
does a set of eight and then a set of
two and then a set of zero because he
can't recover fast enough
110 pound calf training girl
has to sit around for a minute and a
half between sets she could have done
all of them within a minute and a half
so
just use this simple formula and you're
good to go if you have any questions
