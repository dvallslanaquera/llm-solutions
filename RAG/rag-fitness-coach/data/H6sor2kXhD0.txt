hey folks dr mike israel here for
the very important video question of
are you training too light the answer is
yes you were strain heavier
jk if you think you might be training
too heavy check out our last video that
we did
same subject now opposite side of the
fence
remember the question is you're training
too light for hypertrophy training
and very similar setup to the last
lecture that we did
there's an absolutely too light there's
a two light to get the best stimulus to
fatigue ratio
there's personal honesty discussion and
then talking about loading diversity and
exercise matching
so training too light number one
absolutely too light usually means
anything more than
30 reps per set or way higher than that
so
35 reps per set for many exercises are
still very hypertrophic just not as much
as 30.
40 is probably a little less than 50
much less and 60 is like what are you
doing
right so if someone says like let's do a
set of 50 on the leg press
that means without rest pause just a
continual 50 the load
was absolutely so light it just might
not trigger
the tension receptors that generate
growth in your muscles to activate much
and it might trigger them a little bit
each time but as you get
closer to failure and your faster switch
fibers would turn on
tension would be generated and they
would get the growth signal they might
be so inundated with metabolites
burn by the time they get there that
they never even bother turning on much
so that's been shown that if you go
you know to failure at very very high
reps 30 plus
a lot of your biggest fastest motor
units that would grow the most they
never even get a chance to turn on
because by the time they get
into battle there's so many metabolites
they're like because they're the ones
that handle high acidic environments the
worst and their excitation contraction
coupling
their ability to actually the nerve
cells contract and they actually
contract degrades worse
than the slower twitch muscle fibers in
these highly acidic environments
these metabolite inundated environments
so people will say well as long as you
get close to failure all your faster
switch motors activate that's actually
not true
for very high reps that's anything above
30 and you're probably not getting as
much juice out of your muscles
as you could because by the time all of
your muscles are really ready to go
they're so tired they're not going
anywhere right
it's it's almost like here's actually a
really decent analogy
it's uh taking your best sprinter and
instead of having them sprint as fast as
possible right out of the gate and then
stop after 100 meters
you're making him walk five miles with
no shoes and then sprint
right at the end of that five miles go
is he going to sprint pretty fast
sure is it going to be remotely as fast
as he ever did
absolutely not because he's so tired
leading up to that if you had an
endurance runner more slow twitch walk
five miles and then sprint as fast as he
could
his top sprint speed would be almost the
same because he just doesn't get tired
walking
five miles whereas a fast which um
sprinter gets very very tired same idea
actually it's a homological concept uh
not an analogical concept it's literally
the same processes so here's the deal
yes okay let's say you're not going
higher than 30 reps
but sometimes sets of 10 to 20 even and
often sets of 20 to 30 which are
supposed to be hypertrophic
may for you for a certain muscle or for
a certain exercise
not be worth it on stimulus to fatigue
ratio their stimulus might not be that
great and the fatigue might be really
high
so maybe it's too light of training in
that condition even if it's under 30
reps how do we know that's the case
some of the following things could be
happening some or all of them and the
more
the merrier in the sense the more of
these things that happen that i'm gonna
list the more likely it is the training
is too light in that context for that
muscle
for that exercise for that phase of
training so on and so forth here's the
deal
limiting tension at low reps in reserve
is not in the target muscle
like the reason your pull downs are not
happening anymore
is because your rear delts and your
forearms can't generate enough tension
to pull the what weight down and to hold
it your lats are actually sort of fine
they're not even remotely close to
failure
right that's not a good idea because
limiting tension should be in the target
muscle it should be relaxed that can't
pull anymore
which means your lats are getting close
to failure which means they're getting
their hypertrophic stimulus that's not
the case
no bueno not a very good thing next
when you do really close to failure the
burn is not on the target muscle
you're doing high rep bicep curls you're
like ah oh my god it burns and someone's
like okay where's it burning
after the set is over like my forearms
like what about your biceps like nope i
don't feel
shit in my biceps like that's not a
great thing that means your biceps are
not being taken close to failure locally
that means your forms are getting a
great workout but your biceps are not
maybe if you lowered the reps the
forearms wouldn't be limiting factor
anymore because maybe their endurance
isn't that great but they can hold the
weight just fine
you do instead of sets of 20 you just
sets a 10 and at the end your biceps
will feel good
that is a much better thing than getting
the burn limiting somewhere else
next at super high reps your external
technique starts to break down a lot
like when you do lunges for a sets of 20
plus the last five reps no matter how
hard you try are looking like total dog
shit
not a very good thing we definitely
don't want that to happen because the
target muscle is no longer receiving the
load
and the fatigue is probably going to be
high because we're messing up our
technique a whole lot
next this is a real telltale sign
especially for faster twitch folks
training way too light
you have a poor ability to get a lasting
pump with multiple sets i have like very
very fast twitch dominant pecs
if i do like five sets of 20
very close to failure 20 to 30 in the
cable flies
i get almost the same pump as i would
with two sets
of like 10 to 15. it's like what the
hell have i been doing
it just feels like i'm doing an
endurance work you know if you're a
decent runner you go run for two miles
you don't get a pump in your quads you
just feel
tired right like oh yeah my quads felt
like they worked
someone's like you got a crazy pump like
no a lot of people who their muscles are
more fast twitch
they just don't get incredible pumps
from higher reps it just doesn't happen
they just feel tired if that's happening
it's a very good chance the weight is
not heavy enough and you need to
increase the weight
next very related there's minimal or no
disruption after training
okay you've done like 10 sets of 20 in
their 10 sets good god like four or five
sets of 20 in the stiff legged deadlift
but it's very very lightweight
and after you're like oh man my
hamstrings are going to be so messed up
and then nothing happens to your
hamstrings they don't get sore they're
not even weird you can
pull your heels up to your butt anytime
when you're walking around you're like i
feel totally fine
your lower back is sore your upper back
is sore your grip is your forearm
muscles are sore because of holding the
bar
but your hamstrings just wasn't the
match not a good sign
good training means your local muscle is
messed up if it's not
maybe the training was too light in that
case here's another one really really
good one
the sensation at the end of your sets
that you can always do another rep
okay which either happens when your
technique is crappy and you're doing
more reps which is bad
or even if your technique is good and
you feel like okay you stop the lat pull
down then you can do one more
stop and you can do one more and you can
do when you keep going how can you say
you're getting close to failure if you
can always feel like you do one more rep
you're not
sometimes when the weight is really
really light your metabolites clear so
fast that you can keep going that means
your faster twitch motor units will
never really turn on
because you just keep always having more
reps in reserve and they only really
turn on
at very low reps in reserve and remember
we talked about they get inundated with
metabolites anyway by that point
so it's a non-starter if your sets don't
have distinct failure points
you need to train harder and here's the
thing oh sorry train heavier
heavy weight has the most fucking
distinct failure points
ever okay i put your 5 rm on the bench
motherfucker you're not always going to
be able to do one more rep it's going to
get to the point you're like
well that's it right but if i put your
30 rm on the bench you would be like
and then just keep going right how do
you know if you're close to failure you
could have quit
when it was really 10 reps in reserve so
that is a good sign to go lighter
for sure because you you could say to
yourself this is my 30 rm but it's
really your 50 rm
and you're stopping a set of 32 that's
18 rir not going to cause a lot
of hypertrophy and lastly
it's a lot of trying and a lot of
fatigue for a relatively low stimulus
you do all these things
you don't get a super big pump you don't
get a super disruption in the muscles so
the stimulus isn't that great
but like you've just done like 10 sets
of 20 or 30 pull downs and tricep
extensions you're like oh my god i've
beat this is crazy tons of pain tons of
lactate metabolites
you're like what the hell is all this
and it even gets sore all this and he
didn't feel a pump in the muscle
not worth it not the best idea in the
world now
quick time for personal honesty
if you want to do ultra high reps and
not get any growth if you just love high
reps just go do endurance work
trust me you were cut out for it but on
the other hand
don't bitch out of high reps either i
myself have been tempted
on many exercises to make the weight
heavier so the set doesn't last as long
now here's the thing
i know damn well i'll get a better pump
if i do higher reps i know damn well
i can target the local muscle better i
know damn well i'm gonna cause more
hypertrophy with that higher up set
but i'm like that shit is gonna hurt and
25 reps takes forever
i'm just gonna make it heavier and it
sounds like oh i'm tougher
but sometimes people make way heavier so
they just doesn't last as long and they
don't get as big of a burn
then they do sets of 10 instead of sets
of 20 and it's a fine stimulus but it's
not as good and you know it
so here's the thing don't be a wuss just
the same way in the last lecture we
talked about not running away from good
heavy training and saying oh that's too
heavy
don't run away from good high rep
training man up or woman up and do what
it takes
only if you're detecting a whole bunch
of these things in point number two do
you back away
if all these things are good to go just
shut up and do the reps i know it sucks
but you pick the hypertrophy training
and reps grow you really well
time to do them right people say stuff
like bro that's just cardio like no
you're a wuss okay
that's a typical like power lifter for
jokes so it's a five plus is cardio like
shut up
okay if you did sets of ten you'd look
much more like a bodybuilder just to say
bigger and leaner
but you don't want to do it because you
get tired oh no right so a lot of
personal honesty required there
now lastly loading diversity and
exercise matching very similar
discussion
to our last video so i'm going to keep
it short and sweet some exercises are
supposed to be trained heavier and
they're more conducive to that
to put it another way they're safer to
train heavier there's less joint fatigue
you can get a better mind muscle
connection better tension through the
target muscle
and the target muscle is still the
limiting factor deadlift presses squats
bubble rose pull-ups etc sets 5-15 are
great
on the other hand if you're gonna do
high rep work using those exercises is
usually
a bad idea super high reps for squats
become a back exercise
not a quad exercise super high reps for
pull ups become a forearm exercise
and so on and so forth so if you want to
do higher reps usually
you're better off doing them with
machines dumbbells lunges cables so on
and so forth
in the 15 to 30 rep range so pick your
exercises wisely
yeah using the whole 5 to 30 range is a
good idea
when you go heavier you have certain
exercises that make you are more
conducive to heavy
training and when you go lighter use the
exercises that are more conducive for
light training right
and when an exercise is you know
honestly with yourself and you really
think it's too light
you either increase the weight using the
exercise no big deal and probably
reduce the repetitions or you switch an
exercise that tolerates the load
better uh or sorry that tolerates the
lower load and thus the higher reps
better
so if you're you're doing bent rows and
sets of 20 30 have all those downsides
and it's the tar
you know your erectors are limiting you
and not your pulling muscles
you know what okay i'm gonna make the
the row you know a little bit heavier
and then all of a sudden you're not
getting the pumps on the metabolite burn
if it doesn't sets a 15 instead of
25 like you wanted you're like okay bent
rows are out
you do cable rows and all of a sudden
you're doing sets of 25 reps and you're
hitting every muscle where you're
supposed to and everything's
really really awesome so then you made
the correct decision
now same as in the heavy loading range
the lightest ranges are not for all
muscle groups not for all exercises and
not for all individuals
you can run into a situation where you
get pretty much nothing
out of reps of a certain number out of
certain exercises
people might say lunges they're great do
sets of 20 plus and you do them you just
never get anything out of them
they may be no trick you may just not
ever want to do lunges for sets of 20 or
more
you may want to do lunges for sets of 10
to 20 and if that doesn't work if that's
too heavy and about your joints too much
lunges just might not be your exercise
and that's totally okay you can use a
bunch of different exercises
so you don't think you have to do
anything just never write off
a rep range altogether so if a lot of
your muscles or some muscle particularly
let's say
your glutes just never really gets much
out of the 20 or 30 rep range
move away from it completely only do
sets of 5 to 20 reps for the glutes for
several months several message cycles no
big deal
later maybe experiment with a new
exercise in a slightly higher rep range
sets of 20 to 25
and you might be pleasantly surprised
when you're bigger you're stronger
you're more practicing mind muscle
connection
you actually do get more out of higher
ups finally but especially if you're
beginner intermediate
you don't have to do the 20 to 30 rep
range at all and if you feel really
wacky doing it don't do it no big deal
just don't write it off forever
come back to it at some point and try
again folks thank you so much for tuning
in
