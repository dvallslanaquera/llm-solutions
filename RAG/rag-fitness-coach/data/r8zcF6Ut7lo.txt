hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization i think that's
the most i've ever abbreviated my last
name
israelite size strength
and aging let's figure out how to train
for size and strength what to expect
at the different levels of human age
what are they we're going to talk about
general differences
and principles of training if you're
from anywhere between 15 and 30 years
old
like if you're less than 15 years old
that's another special topic of how to
train teens
i'll cover years from now or something
we have a laundry list of things to
cover
so don't worry that's coming at some
point but 15 to 30 years old general
category
next one is 30 to 40 years old then 40
to 60 years old and then 60 years old
plus
at the end we'll have some really good
take-home messages for all of that stuff
so 15 to 30 years old you can expect
your best responses
to both size and strength training this
is where you make
your best absolute gains there's no huge
difference within this range
there are some differences but generally
speaking if someone's like
17 years old and they're like what kind
of gains can i expect if i start
training
or if they're like 27 years old what
kind of gains can i start
when i uh or can i expect when i start
training there's not a huge difference
between those answers it's not like oh
27 you're a fucking old man
you had amazing gains that entire time
or as amazing as your genetics allow
you recover really quickly generally
from joint stress
so you can repeat back to back pretty
heavy no problem
if you get hurt the injury recovery
process is what i've turned
uncomplicated usually
like you get hurt your muscle gets
pulled or torn the surgeons stick it
back on or just heals on its own
you come back you rehab you go you live
for a while then a few months later it's
like it never happened or pretty close
nothing too crazy nothing to worry about
so this kind of rewards going hard and
heavy
because even if you get hurt of course
you do your best not to but even if you
get hurt it's not the end of the world
if you're not
if you've never been hurt by the time
you're 30 there's a good chance you did
everything completely awesomely
and there's also a decent chance you
just never trained hard enough so it's
not that we want injuries it's just that
if injury risk has to happen with some
powerlifting and stuff like that it does
it's decent this is the best time in
your life to accept that risk is what
i'm trying to say
if you want maximum lifetime gains
that is at some point in your life reach
your absolute zenith of
genetic potential or whatever starting
to train
early or middle of this range is
critical so if you want to be the best
possible bodybuilder you could ever be
if you start training at like age 28 or
29 that might still happen
not super likely if you start training
at age 18 or 19
very likely right and if you're if
you're age 15
and you're like i want to be as jacked
and strong as possible who fuck knows
what's going on in your head when i was
15 i had all kinds of fucking bologna in
my head
if you're really intent that's actually
a good time to start working on basic
size and strength
what you want to do in this age range
especially is
focus on the basic mass and strength
building the construction of
raw mass and strength a lot of times
with compound heavy basics
not on details of strength and physique
as much so
if you're age 15 to 30 especially in the
early years
if you're like yeah i got to bring up my
forms to balance out my biceps shut the
fuck up just get big
once you're big you can bring up
performs and other small muscle groups
no problem don't you worry too much
about the details inner chest and shit
like that
if you want your maximum lifetime gains
now if you just want to be age 25 and
have the best inner chest at the club
so all the girls are like ooh and the
boys are like ooh and both boys and
girls
tons of people having sex with your
chest or whatever what kind of shit
you're into
by all means specialize early but if you
want to be the biggest and strongest you
ever be
don't worry about specializing earlier
and through the middle of this range
next up if you're age 30 to 40 years old
what's going on what can you expect you
get good responses generally to size and
strength training
once you get closer to 40 many people
start to see a lowering of responses
that doesn't mean you get worse it means
you get better
notably slower so if you're gaining
muscle your whole life from let's say
you started training at age 15
by the time you get to 35 36 37
you can still gain muscle but it's going
to be noticeably slower
than it was uh even if you
uh you know compared to like age you
know
17 18 19 or something like that and if
you
start lifting at 35 36 37
you're not going to get 18 or 19 year
old kind of growth
rates you're just not versus if you
start uh you know
in your early 30s you can get actually
really comparable rates to when you
start in early 20s so on and so forth so
especially towards the end of that range
there's a bit of a meeting on there
it's not the best responses through that
range anyway joint stress recovery
is decent okay so it's nothing too crazy
your joints are going to be super fucked
up it's not super high risk
um on average if you get hurt during
this age range
recovery is decent nothing to write home
about but it can be lengthy and might
not always be complete like sometimes
when you hurt yourself when you're let's
say 37 38 39
the shit might never feel a hundred
percent again even if the doctors
reattach it or even if it wasn't a full
evolution or something
it's just that it's not something you
play with nearly as much when you're
young a lot of times you get hurt and
it's like nothing ever happened right
uh if you started lifting in the 15
to 30 age range 30 to 40 is when you
usually hit
especially in the later 35 to 40 is when
most people usually hit their absolute
peak
of strength and size right some people
hit it in their early 40s we'll talk
about that in the next category but
this from a practical perspective age 30
to 40 is where you start really focusing
on details
like if you need to bring up your forms
or something like that
that's when it's time to focus on the
small details uh because you need them
to squeeze out progress it's also when
you start focusing on the details of
sort of exotic programming you might do
very high frequency for bicep
because that's a you know two to four
sessions a week for biceps aren't just
cutting it
you need really advanced routine all
kinds of crazy periodization this is
where you shoot all of your guns off if
you want your
lifetime best because this is where your
lifetime best is happening if you wait
until your 40s
to do all your best techniques your
lifetime best might have already passed
you by
right 40 to 60 years old
so here is where we on average see
significantly lower
responses to size and strength training
than you did in your 30s to 40
and then you did from 15 to 30. so
almost everyone's going to see lower to
average responses
which is to say if you start lifting in
this age range so someone starts lifting
when they're 40
and they're like let's say their
training partner and this actually
happens a lot
dad starts lifting his 42 he starts
lifting with a son
who's 17. like this shit happens all the
time you see gyms all the time it's nice
it's nice to see
um if your dad do not and let's say it's
the first time for both of you
don't expect the same rate of gains as
your son don't because it's almost not
never going to happen
very rarely and it does if you gave your
son shit dog shit genetics you got to
blame the wife what the hell honey
right so generally speaking you you just
won't see nearly as good of growth rates
as you did when you were younger
there is a big difference in this range
however ages 40 to 50 you can see some
pretty decent gains especially if you
started training that range
50 to 60 you still see gains but much
much lower on average so there's a big
sort of bifurcation in that range the
joint stress recovery is now longer
notably longer which means
heavy sessions should be less frequent
okay you're not gonna do
monday five by five wednesday five by
five friday five by five heavy like you
used to do back when you were 17 years
old that shit is fucking gone
you might need to do is more lighter
sessions sets
of 10 to 30 reps a little bit more
frequently interspersed between heavy
ones
and the light sessions now make up a
bigger fraction of your total volume
than they used to
because the joints just don't handle
chronic recovery
nearly as well as they used to if you
get hurt
there are potentially much more
complicated avenues of recovery from
those injuries that you sustain
so you want to make sure if you're age
40 to 60 and you're training with
weights and you want your best results
that injury avoidance is huge in your
training
like you don't do stupid shit anymore
when you're 40 to 60.
you're like fuck it i feel like a 1rm ah
that shit died when you turned 30.
and when you once you were 30 you
stopped doing stupid shit like that once
you turned 40 you for sure
started not doing super shit like that
anymore because that'll cost you
potentially all kinds of function and
they're like well we
actually wanted to reattach your pack
but it's so calcified we can't do it
anymore like oh my fuck i just tore my
pack and i'm never getting it back you
don't want any of that nonsense so you
really want to make sure
you're training extra safe which does
mean not as effectively as you used to
but there's a huge trade-off do you want
to keep trading training and making some
gains or keeping some gains on your body
or do you want to risk it all
for pretty much nothing right if
you have started training in your the
in this range itself okay if you're 42
and you started training you'll see
really really big changes for sure
because some people have this
misconception hopefully this video
refutes
if they're in the 40s or 50s uh they
don't bother with weight training
because like oh that's a young guy's
game you know i'm not going to make
gains
you will for sure make gains if you
start training and you're 42
fuck you're gonna make crazy gains for
the first five years and for the next 10
years you're going to consistently
still make gains they won't be
incredible but like you can get stronger
into your into your
50s and maybe even your 60s and even
bigger too right so if you start late
you can still have awesome progress here
if you started lifting in the 30 to 40
age range you'll peak in that 40 to 60
age range
if you started lifting in the 15 to 30
range and have been serious
you'll probably peak between 30 or 40 or
in your early 40s
and after that in your 40s and 50s and
especially 50s and 60s
you may be able to hold your size and
strength and or reduce it slowly
some that's depressing as fuck to some
people but think of it this way
if you got up to benching 400 pounds
when you were in your prime and you know
age 35 to 45
by the time that you're 60 you could
only be benching
330. how many 60 year olds you know a
bench
330 holy shit that's crazy so at that
point it starts to psychologically at
least be really beneficial for you to
compare yourself to your age cohort and
that
is awesome and also you know sometimes
people at age 60
are having trouble whether it's tough to
get out of chairs or what the fuck i'm
not young anymore
fuck that if you still squat you used to
squat 400 now you only squat 300.
300 squatter is no problem getting out
of a chair unless it's leg day and then
that's a real problem
all right 60 plus years old our last
group here
real talk vastly lowered responses to
size
and strength training you just don't see
the same absolute or relative responses
in people like if you have
people who are older than the 60 jurors
training program they get some responses
but it's not nearly like 15
to 30 year olds so forget about that
there are big differences within this
range
60 to 75 you can see some pretty great
responses 75 plus
is tough you still get some stuff but
it's much tougher much bigger difference
your joint stress recovery times are now
much longer heavy sessions need to be
much less frequent
lighter sessions more frequent probably
most of the work should be light
so if you're lifting for sustainability
in this in this
age category if you're over 60 i think
most of your work should probably be
in that 10 to 30 rep range some can be
in the lower rep ranges especially if
you're pretty strong
but there's a trade-off there there's a
balance because you're not gonna be able
to do
workout after workout after workout it's
a five to eight it's just not gonna work
in most cases your joints are just not
gonna agree with that sort of thing
there is a lot of potential for
complicated recovery from injury
and you want to make sure that injury
avoidance is huge in your training more
to the point
you may want to do sort of like an
anti-injury an
injury prevention checklist is kind of
the core foundation of your training
and this is a weird way to think about
it i don't want any of you younger folks
to think about it this way because this
would be a bad way for you to think
about it when you're older
job number one in the gym don't get hurt
job number
two get results right the thing is for
younger people it's flipped the other
way
job number one is get results job number
two is okay but don't get hurt doing it
if you're older the last fucking thing
you want to do is tear some shit up in
the gym
fuck that because you could recover it
could take a year to recover
you could never recover it could start
uh unlikely but possible
a series of events where you just never
leave the hospital and you just fucking
die there like you're not gonna you know
you evolve your quad or something under
the squat bar and then on the way down
your femur shatters and all the fucking
icu and you're 77 years old you don't
want to be part of that
injury management first so for sure all
the dumb shootery
in the gym should be out of your body by
the time you're this age range
and if you're still a dumb ass when
you're 75 i don't know if i know i would
say to you you had to come in your whole
life quite literally
if you start lifting in this range a lot
of people start lifting in their 60s and
70s and 80s
you will see the most life-altering
changes
that anyone else will look if you're 15
years old you start lifting great you
get bigger
your pecs pop out girls notice a little
guys notice a lot
your life fundamentally doesn't change
you know usually you don't get laid much
more
anyway whatever sweet you're muscular
yahoo or slow clap you
had no problem going to a fast food
place and ordering a burger
putting it in your car in the bag
driving home feeding like
part of the bun to your dog sitting and
watching tv you could do that when
you're jacked you could do that when
you're skinny it doesn't fucking matter
when you're 75 years old or 80 years old
if you start
training with weights you can upgrade
yourself to just like a normal 40 year
old's abilities physically
and then you can take care of yourself
until the fucking day you die
and if you don't do that
you could be in a place where you don't
you are physically not strong enough to
get up out of a chair anymore you may
not be strong enough to reach for normal
objects like a thing of milk or
something like that
you're in a bad way so these changes
it's
super like we you know if we're looking
at public health of the world
you know does does the you know do the
various agencies responsible for that
tell young people to lift weights like
not really because you're fucking young
whenever fine you're fine
but older people absolutely should be
lifting weights in almost every
circumstance because for
them that sir that alteration is huge
so here's the thing yes the first part
of the slide here says vastly low
response to size strength training
you may look at it and say like oh fuck
that why the hell would i train
you know my grandma wants me to train
her she's 62. fuck would i do that like
come on grandma you're
fucking too old like you know the gym's
not your place anymore
the gym is mostly for grandma she
belongs to you more than the rest of us
do we're just doing this for our
creation she's doing it
to sustain her independent way of life
really really really big deal
make sure we have to start saying that
if you started lifting in the 40 to 60
range
you might peak here especially in your
early 60s but begin to reduce size and
strength in your 70s and 80s it's not
realistic to be benching 400 pounds or
80 years old and
all the other groups folks that started
much earlier started in 30 start in
their 20s and teens
they'll get smaller and weaker through
this range however big point i'm going
to make this point again in the last
slide
smaller and weaker is relative and if
you're 70 years old and you only bench
150 pounds
where you used to be you know 350 pound
bencher back in your prime
yeah it kind of fucking blows right i
wish we were all immortal and infinitely
strong
but if you're in your 70s i mentioned
150 you fucking think anyone needs to
help you the fucking jug of milk
fuck that you fucking 150 you're
overqualified right that's a big ass
jug of milk you have to get out of the
out of the fridge right so
it's a huge dividend still awesome to
keep lifting weights in a
matter of fact relatively speaking much
more awesome to lift weights in this age
range than at any other time
so if you're watching this video and
you're like getting into your 40s and
shit you're like fuck i should stop
lifting don't do that
keep lifting keep lifting all right
lastly
a few important take-home messages so
a lot of people ask this super common so
hopefully you folks are tuning in
i started lifting at xyz age can i still
get
amazing results can i still have my
ultimate potential the answer is no
so you're very unlikely to reach your
ultimate genetic potential
if you start lifting after age 30. okay
and the later after age 30
you have started lifting the less likely
you are to reach that maximum genetic
potential it's just
it's just a statement of fact it sucks i
wish it wasn't that that way
but you can still get jackman strong
absolutely and
relatively way more jacked and strong
than you would have ever been without
lifting
for sure now point number two
huge point if you're not in your 20s or
teens anymore
do not lift like you did in your 20s and
teens youth rewards the bold
so someone's like what do you think five
more pounds pr like fuck yeah load that
shit
boom age 25 let's do it if you're older
age rewards the cautious and the patient
okay so if you have if you're 55 years
old your training partner's 52 and he's
like what do you think five more pounds
jim shut the fuck up put a regular
weight on the bar let's not die here
today
so we can come back tomorrow and the day
after and the day after right
huge huge thing one of the things that i
wouldn't call as a pet peeve is just
kind of fucking sad
pet peeves annoy you but i don't know
what this is like it's just like a
depressing thing
when i see older people older older
doing bro
gym fuckery swing curls and round back
crazy
cat like kind of deadlift where you're
like are you a cat getting scared on
halloween are you dead lifting i can't
tell
it's like what are you doing like you
can't afford to get hurt
why are you doing this dumb shit needs
to stop when you're younger
ideally wouldn't happen when you're
younger but at the very least it should
happen when you're
when you're older it should stop
happening when you're older
as you get older especially than 30
we'll say
30 is kind of the general cutoff here
you want to
put more emphasis into the following
things these should always be things you
put some emphasis into but
really start to basically grow up for
actually as an exact perfect term for
this
listen to your body more warm up more
and more slowly
take your time rushing warm-ups when
you're in your 20s whatever shit happens
right you got fucking hoes to being at
the club you can't take 30 minutes to
warm up
when you're you're 36 years old like i
am in this video
you're gonna warm up otherwise you're
gonna get hurt and then you're really
really fucked
like you just can't afford to rush
things anymore ramp up volume and load
slowly in mesos again you should still
be doing that but when you're older you
especially should be doing that because
you're gonna fuck yourself up if you
don't accumulate fatigue goes like this
and injury risk goes like that as well
next one
don't risk it all he's about to risk it
all isn't that like a
a joke about like uh hitting on someone
in any case i'm not
i'm not much in the instagram generation
so risking it all for big pr as often is
a fucking stupid idea
like look when you're like 19 years old
and you just pulled 405 and it went
way fast and that's the most you've ever
pulled you look around your friends are
like 4 55 and you're like
fuck yeah it doesn't come up whatever
shit happens or
how it comes up halfway and you tweak
your back whatever three weeks later
you're fine i'm not saying it's a good
idea it's just not the worst thing in
the world
now when you're 55 years old and you hit
370 for the first time ever in the
deadlift and someone's like we think 405
you're like yeah
you're a fucking idiot don't do stupid
shit like that work up to it over the
couple weeks
don't risk it all because you could be
like oh sweet i just herniated my
fucking discs in my back
and i can't control my bladder anymore
and i'm gonna spend three months at the
hospital that none of that shit is for
you
right so don't do anything dumb anymore
and you can still train close to failure
but you probably want to train more
with lighter weights and you want to
train
a little bit less with sets of one to
three for strength
and you want to keep it more in the sets
of three to six range if strength
training is your thing
and for hypertrophy training stay a
little bit outside of the five to ten
range for most things other things you
can
and go a little bit more on the 10 and
20 and 20 to 30 range because you still
get a hyper fee but it doesn't risk
with a high absolute forces injury just
as much now
here's the thing point number four last
point the super bright side
about lifting through the aging process
it sucks
flat out to get older uh or sorry to get
weaker as you age
it fucking blows i'm level with you guys
i agree there's a lot of people trying
to paint like this
happy picture there's one lecture i was
listening to about uh
anti-aging medicine and potential future
stuff this guy
like refuted the concept of like aging
gracefully he's like aging fucking blows
there's no way to do it gracefully just
look less like shit than you thought you
would have
so i'm totally on board with that it
fucking blows but
if you stick to hard lifting throughout
your lifespan you have a very good
chance of dying with the strength of an
average
untrained 30 year old now none of us
here watching this video
wanna have the strength of an average
untrained 30 year old if that fucking
blow some fucking like computer
programmer guy who's never lifted you're
like oh great i'm as strong as this guy
even though i've been lifting weights my
whole life ah
but you're 85. he's 30.
what realistic real world shit can a 30
year old untrained man not do the answer
is not anything our society is designed
for a 30 year old man of average
strength matter of fact he's
overqualified
because most things in society like
opening up your car door did you be a
fucking 10 year old and open up your car
door
reaching for things that are a little
bit heavy shopping by yourself pushing a
cart
taking a backpack and slinging over your
shoulder if you're the strength of an
average i mean have you ever seen an
average 30 year old struggle with
putting a backpack on and what the fuck
is wrong are you sick or some shit
so if you die if you're at your later
years
with the physical strength at least you
know up until the last couple months or
who knows
of the average 30 year old oh my fuck
there was never a single time in your
life
where you were unable to care for
yourself you weren't able to travel you
weren't able to hike and do all of your
favorite things
which brings me to my story about my one
of my grandparents
he uh 10 or 15 years back he died
he was he fought in world war ii on the
russia side
killed a whole shitload of nazis did all
kinds of unspeakable shit that every now
and again when he got a little tipsy he
would start talking about
like holy fuck worse fucked up he's like
90 years old when he died or in his very
late 80s
and he died in america he was walking he
was it gardened his whole life
he was always physically active he never
formally lifted weights but he lifted
heavy objects all the time he moved pot
like
big uh pots of plants around and soil
he's always stayed active so it's
basically resistance training right
a bunch of people his age went to
nursing homes and all this other crazy
shit and spent the last
10 or 20 years of life sitting in a
chair watching tv or laying in bed and
watching tv
he walked around all the time he was
always independent
he went shopping by himself the way he
died
was he was walking just down a path in a
suburban neighborhood in like
fucking ohio or some shit and he felt it
fucking coming he's like i'm fucking
dying
he sat just sat down by the side of a
tree lean back and just died right there
sitting
fucking died like a ball or king that's
fucking amazing and up
literally until the last day up until
the very day that he died he was
completely independent needed nobody's
help
if you lift weights you have a very high
chance of dying like that if you don't
lift weights until
you're older or you never pick up
lifting weights you could die
after 30 years of machines taking care
of your nursing home
which one you want folks thanks for
tuning in when you die
die well
you
