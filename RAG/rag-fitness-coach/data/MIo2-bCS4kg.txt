folks when you post on Instagram make
sure you're not reeling off of cocaine
when you do it
hey everybody I am Dr Mike Israel I am
an exercise in sport physiologist that's
a fancy title I'm a professor of sports
science at Lehman College in the Bronx
in New York City and I am a co-founder
of Renaissance periodization and year
here arms Channel and we do Sport
Science here and we are going to look at
some videos of various tick talkers and
famous people working out
trying to analyze them charitably but
honestly let's take a look
Mr Bradley Martin who is uh supposed to
be very very strong and athletic he has
one two this is about 495 pounds five
plate power row no belt just pure
depression power row what's that so so I
would file Mr Bradley Martin under just
fucking strong as shit but I would file
this exercise under pure nonsense
I don't know what it trains I don't know
what it accomplishes it is not a power
movement a power clean would be a good
idea I don't know why someone would do
this outside of very specific sport
context
or just you want to fuck around a lot
put yourself in a greater risk of injury
for tearing your bicep or some shit like
that TBH man with all due respect I just
wouldn't do this and ego trophy comments
no reps were done love you though
Bradley I gotta say if I were Bradley
Martin I would be fucking furious at
that comment I hate it when people think
they're compliment sandwiching you and
they just say some nasty shit like zero
reps bruh and then they're like love you
though like fuck you you don't know who
the fuck I am you don't love me
get out of my face
but here I am talking shit about Bradley
so maybe I'm the same person although I
guess I'm not saying I love he is he is
strong and jacked that is objective what
what the fuck is he saying
Mark says God did stay prayed up
heart symbol
at perform inspired but the app is
separated from perform inspired so it's
actually not a tag the link that works
folks when you post on Instagram make
sure you're not reeling off of cocaine
when you do it shit you say may make
sense to nobody his technique here is
good I'd say I'd like to see a bit more
eccentric control from these Nordic
curls that is the only point of the
exercise why is Mark wearing white
gloves on that Michael Jackson workout I
guess I will say that he doesn't age
this could have been posted in 1988 and
he would look the same technique could
use some work Mr Mark Wahlberg all love
and respect just me shooting the
bullshit
Ben Bruno training I've heard of this
person he says give this supported
single leg RDL a try great for the
glutes hamstrings and adductors at
Chelsea Handler is using a 53 pound
weight here which is super impressive
and shows that she has a great balance
of strength and Mobility those are not
mutually exclusive by the way I asked
Chelsea for a testimonial for my new
website and she wrote I was always
worried about getting too big with
weight training the opposite has
happened I am leaner and tighter than I
was in my 20s that's really nice I mean
yeah technically speaking it's a single
leg RDL and you get to balance your
other leg on a bench I would say that
putting your leg really far away from
you on a bench really far away
needlessly destabilizes the exercise if
you do these with what's called a b
stance you could probably get more out
of it but she seems like she's got the
balance to make it
do pretty good stuff
the number of reps in reserve for that
exercise seems to be approximately
Infinity
I wouldn't call this hard training these
sets here maybe they were a warm-up but
this is a warm-up
it's a warm-up which means she's really
strong
and uh can really kick it
so I'd love to see her do like actual
rdls and not single legs
and uh just get like Preposterous and
she would probably get way better
results in less time people I think say
Ben Bruno knows what he's doing and I
think this is just uh is just a fine
exercise but uh yeah
okay we've got the rock
doing belt squats with
ton of plates all the plates at the gym
and the caption says got a late went in
at the sanctuary tonight Sunday Wheels
leg night
that's a lot of saying the same thing
three times four rounds of giant sets
non-stop leg press vertical leg press
chain lunges finishing with pit shark
sumo squats with three second negatives
fun pain so these are very
small range of motion
they probably do okay at training the
adductors the inner thigh certainly not
the quads maybe a little bit of glutes
good good slapping there the rock is so
jacked my God I think the rock is like
the ideal man and everyone else is just
a shitty copy of the rock myself
included but um that is not the best
technique I would love to see the
Rockies about half that weight maybe
less
get his feet a little bit closer
together stay upright and sink down like
three feet lower
that would torch his legs
a ton but hold on I'm simply an expert
exercise and sports scientist let's see
what the comments have to say to really
find out oh he's training to beat Paper
meanwhile scissors is in a dungeon gym
headphones in hoodie up coming after all
these motherfuckers wait
The Rock starting out for women what
would you recommend
ma'am let me tell you something that may
seem condescending and it is the
probability of The Rock
answering your question
out of the let's see how many comments
24
000 comments
just his Tick Tock he also has an
Instagram that's even bigger is
infinitesimally small if he responded to
any exercise science questions but I'm
inclined to believe he just doesn't
respond to anything at all for the most
part you could probably just Google that
shit
[Applause]
Steven Seagal shows how to fight two men
at the same time I've been with two men
at the same time but I wouldn't call
what we were doing fighting and the best
part is Tick Tock Auto labeled this
video to say the actions in this video
are performed by professionals or
supervised by professionals do not
attempt and the question is precisely
what actions are those these are not
fighting professionals they're like
gymnastics professionals what in the
ever loving God is this
it is not fighting this is Hollywood
I do have to say Wag the Dog a little
bit I am a brown Belton Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu in my spare time I do know how to
fight a little bit and none of this is
real nobody fights like this what I
would love to see is a video of a decent
High School wrestler
who weighs like 130 pounds just running
in there and spear double leggings
Steven Seagal into a coma fuck this is a
very Cooperative engagement and for all
of the bad stuff I'm saying
Steven Seagal has my permanent
Everlasting respect for being himself
and what true thespians have labeled as
perhaps the second best actor of all
time Arnold Schwarzenegger being the
first of course
next video is on the Instagram and it is
of Mr Shaquille O'Neal oh my and he's
shirtless oh hitting that X pose
a little bit of another setup to oppose
no real poses hit yet folks
oh and the first side chest not terribly
well executed I might add what else we
got Shaq show us some love here
front lat spread impressive
and nodding at the camera my God rear
double bicep
uh oh he's about to hit us with that
lats Brad boom
done he actually has really big traps
Color Me impressed oh no an AB and thigh
I love it classic poses Shaq's really
got it all holy crap
the whole posing routine he could step
on stage with this this is just pure art
big doubts big packs little pack bounce
Shaq's the man
Shaq is a model human being and
currently my best bodybuilder after
seeing that posing routine celebrities
troll The Descent full range of motion
good technique and the weights will come
get a person to run your socials for you
for the love of God
the at symbol has to be connected to the
words for us to be able to click if I
was that Fitness company and I had a
contract with Mr Wahlberg that uh he was
going to mention me every now and again
and that is not a mention that does not
count towards the contract we'll see you
guys next time
fuck
you'll be like Mark are you okay bro
