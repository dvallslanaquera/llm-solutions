if you are gonna use drop sets for
gaining muscle they definitely can't
have their place
but i'd highly recommend doing them in
the way that i just showed you otherwise
it's possible that they could even do
more harm than good what's up guys sean
nalawani realscienceathletics.com and in
this video today we are talking about
drop sets so what are drop sets are drop
sets effective for building muscle and
what is the proper way to do them and i
definitely want to explain that last
part
because most people in the gym perform
drop sets in the wrong way or at least
they do them in a way
that i would say is not optimal for
muscle growth
so first off for the beginners out there
what is a drop set
very simply it's where after you've
completed your normal set
you immediately reduce the weight and
then you continue performing additional
reps
and there's no exact protocol for this
uh you might reduce the weight once
crank out some more reps and then stop
right there or you might drop the weight
multiple times it could be anywhere from
about one to three drops in weight or
even more than that depending on the
situation
now the next question is are drop sets
effective for building muscle and what's
the difference between
drop sets versus straight sets in this
regard
so what i would say is that the primary
benefit of drop sets
is that they are a simple way to
accumulate more training volume for a
given muscle
in an efficient manner so instead of
doing a normal standard set and then
resting for your regular two to three
minutes or more
and then performing an entirely new set
with a drop set you're basically just
tagging extra reps onto the end of the
same set
in order to increase the overall
workload but without having to do
entirely separate sets
so that is the primary benefit i don't
think there's anything
special about drop sets from a pure
bottom line hypertrophy standpoint i
don't think that on a rep for rep basis
that doing drop sets is going to give
you some special increase in gains in
some unique way
but it's just one potential method of
many different methods
that you could optionally use to get in
some additional work for a given
muscle so you might use drop sets if you
wanted to be more time efficient in the
gym
maybe on a particular day or during a
given training cycle depending on your
circumstances
or if there's a certain muscle group
that you want to emphasize in that case
you could throw in
a drop set or two to increase the volume
for that muscle so maybe you're doing a
legs push pull split
and you want to get in some extra work
for your triceps on push day
but without having to significantly
prolong your time in the gym and perform
a bunch of extra sets
in that case maybe on your triceps push
downs you do your two standard straight
sets and then on the third and last set
for that exercise
you add in a drop set to boost up the
overall workload for your triceps
now i do think that drop sets should
probably be used sparingly for most
people
and i also think that if you're a novice
then they're probably not going to be
necessary for the most part
you know there's no need to deviate away
from basic straight sets if you're still
in the process
of building up your overall size and
strength base but all in all
drop sets are just one tool in the
overall toolbox
that could be used here and there
depending on your needs
now that said in my view most people who
use drop sets are doing them wrong or at
least they're doing them in a way that
is
sub optimal for building muscle and
that's because they treat drop sets
too much like this sort of ultra high
rep fluff and pump work
and they drop the weight by too large of
a percentage each time and just end up
cranking out a bunch of sloppy junk reps
that increases their levels of muscle
damage and overall fatigue but without
stimulating hypertrophy in the most
effective way
[Music]
keep in mind that muscle growth is
primarily a product of performing
a high enough total volume of reps up
near the point of muscular failure
it's those last one to three reps of the
set that really carry
uh the real muscle building juice and
those easier reps that you're doing
prior to that point
they're really basically just there to
get you to the point in the set where
you're exerting yourself maximally on
the last few reps
that's what triggers the muscle building
process because you're challenging the
existing strength capacity of the muscle
and you're forcing your body to adapt
further
now we can argue about metabolic stress
uh being a driver of hypertrophy as well
so even if you're further away from
failure
but there's a significant pump and burn
going on that could have some value as
well
but ultimately reps that are within
about three reps of failure
uh probably four at the most and i would
say ideally two or less
those are the reps that pack the most
muscle building punch
uh without a doubt so based on that in
my view
an optimal drop set should be performed
in a way so that when you reduce the
weight you're already within a few reps
of failure
you don't want to be making these huge
drops in weight to where you now have to
pump out eight or ten or even more reps
just to get back to that same failure
point
and that's what a lot of people do they
start the exercise they know in their
mind that they're doing a drop set
that's going to last for a longer period
of time
and so they subconsciously sacrifice
their effort on that first set
because they're anticipating those
additional drops that they're going to
have to do so that's the first mistake
they pump out maybe eight to twelve
sub-optimal reps and stop further away
from failure than they normally would
then they drop the weight and now they
pump out another uh maybe eight to
twelve reps or so
and maybe they do that multiple times
but because they're performing so many
total reps and the set is being
prolonged for such a long time
the quality of those reps ends up going
down and it just turns into this big
sequence of
lightweight muscle pump slash muscle
burn reps which again could have some
value
but i would say that it's not ideal
because it's going to produce a lot of
fatigue
your cardiovascular system is going to
be more of a factor mental focus will
decline
there's more of a chance for form
breakdown it'll produce more muscle
soreness
and it could also sacrifice performance
on subsequent exercises
for that workout if they're not saving
those drop sets until the very end
so if we're talking in terms of uh
stimulus to fatigue ratio
i think that those types of drop sets
are definitely not going to be ideal
you can still do them sparingly here and
there if you want as long as you can
remain
mentally focused for the entire duration
of the set and you can get close to
failure
on each weight drop and you just want to
do a higher rep uh more pump style
approach
maybe at the very end of your workout as
a finisher then that's up to you
but i would say that it's more efficient
and it has more overall muscle building
value
if you do it in the following way so
first off make sure that the initial set
is performed
just as intensely as you would do any
other straight set so don't go in
thinking
uh you know i'm performing a drop set
and there's going to be three
weight drops and lots of reps being done
here and it's going to be really
uncomfortable
and then as a result of thinking that
you hold back on the initial set
so get focused and perform that first
set just like you would any other
by exerting yourself fully with full
effort and getting within at least a
couple of reps of true muscular failure
then when you're done that first batch
of reps reduce the weight but
only by just enough so that on the next
set you can only manage
i would say around three to five reps at
whatever level of intensiveness that
you're using
so keep in mind that you don't have to
go to failure on drop sets you know you
can still do them within
one to two reps of failure that's
totally fine so do
your three to five reps and then if
you're gonna do another drop
again just reduce the weight by just
enough so that you're only getting
another
three to five reps and then just repeat
that for however many times you're doing
i would say anywhere from one drop in
weight up to maybe three drops in weight
that would be appropriate in most cases
but again there really is no exact
protocol for this
so by doing it that way by reducing the
weight
only just enough so that you can squeeze
out another roughly three to five reps
or so
the overall muscle building quality of
that set is going to increase
because you're keeping yourself closer
to failure the whole time and you're
eliminating those extra junk wraps that
you really didn't need to do and so
it's just more efficient in that regard
you're basically just
trimming out the fat and focusing on
those maximum quality reps
up near muscular failure and this way
you're also going to be preventing
your cardiovascular system from becoming
a limiting factor
you're maximizing mental focus because
you're not needlessly dragging the
exercise on for longer than you need to
you're also minimizing the chances for
form breakdown and you're also making
sure
that each batch of reps you're going to
be stopping because you're truly close
to muscular failure
rather than stopping because it just
burns too much
and all of those things combined it just
makes for an overall
higher quality set with higher quality
reps being executed
and you're also not creating more
fatigue and more muscle damage and more
soreness
than you ultimately really need to again
drop sets aren't mandatory
um i don't add them into people's
programs by default but they're just an
optional strategy that you can use to
get some extra work in
for certain muscle groups here and there
but if you are going to use drop sets
for gaining muscle they definitely can't
have their place but i'd highly
recommend doing them in the way that i
just showed you
otherwise it's possible that they could
even do more harm than good
