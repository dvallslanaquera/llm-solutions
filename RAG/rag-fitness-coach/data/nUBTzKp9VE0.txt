hey folks
dr mike israel here for renaissance
periodization
strength training made simple number 15
second to last video in this series
unless we add more later
matching your training to your diet
right because diet's the thing even for
strength training folks we want to make
sure we do the right kind of dieting
phases
at the right time during our strength
training so
you can weight gain diet so a lot of
people are trying to get bigger which is
sweet it's going to make you a lot
stronger
what kind of training should you do well
if you gain weight during peaking the
volume is so low you just mostly add fat
you can gain weight during strength
training but the volume isn't optimized
and you'll get a little
bit fatter than you want and not as
muscular as you want ideally
when you are gaining weight you should
be doing it with hypertrophy phase
training
and again this is hypertrophy for
strength so you can look back at some of
the other videos like face potentiation
when we talk about what that means
so that's a five to ten compound
hardcore movements the best way to put
on a ton of size that makes you stronger
later so if you're
gaining weight if i walk in the gym and
you're a power lifter or a strong man or
a weight lifter
and you tell me that you're on a weight
gain plan and i watch you do your
training
i'll be very happy if i see lots of sets
of five to ten and if i see a lot of
singles and triples it'd be like
you say you're dieting for weight gain
but you're not training for muscle gain
which doesn't make any sense
now what about maintenance dieting
maintenance dieting is where strength
athletes really live most of their time
good supportive diet for great sport
training in this case for strength so
strength training is great with a
maintenance diet peaking training is
gate
is great even uh hypertrophy phase
training can be done in a maintenance if
you want some recomp
or you just want to build up some work
capacity but ideally a hypertrophy
should be
paired with either a fat loss diet or a
muscle gain diet because
the purpose of the hypertrophy phase is
to change your body is to change your
muscle size
and a lot of times or or your fat stores
and that's when you want to pair the
diet that does the changing and
muscle gain diet and a fat loss diet the
surplus and a deficit they're the ones
that change the body the most
maintenance doesn't change it as much it
can be done but ideally maintenance is
done mostly in strength
and in peaking training now what about
fat loss dieting this is a really really
big question
it's best during hypertrophy phase
training why
because this is where you prevent the
most muscle loss
and you can increase loads a little more
slowly than usual
still gain some hypertrophy you might
actually put on a little bit of muscle
burn plenty of fat but you won't you
don't have to do
super hardcore strength workouts at a
deficit
okay it's really tough doing heavy sets
of three to six when you know
that each week you're a little bit more
depleted that's rough
so you can do fat loss dieting during
strength training
but it's not recommended because in
strength training you want
oomph every workout you show up to
that's hard
and they're all hard on strength
training you want to have
bp you want to be fueled properly and by
definition on a fat loss phase you're
not fueled properly you're fueled
suboptimally that's okay if your goal is
to lose fat
save that for the hypertrophy phase
where the big heavy crazy loads
and the impetus to increase them a ton
are not on the bar not part of the
equation
but you can can in some cases do fat
loss diet during
your actual strength phase training if
you do that you gotta cut
slowly half percent body weight per week
at most
you'll notice from other lectures that
we've done if you're just into
hypertrophy you're just into
muscle and body composition you can diet
as fast as one percent loss per week so
if you 800 pounds you can lose two
pounds a week and be just fine
you probably won't even lose any muscle
in most cases if you want to conserve
your strength
conservative strength no i didn't say go
up your strength probably won't increase
during that time which again
psychologically is brutal but you sort
of knew what you were into you didn't do
it during a hypertrophy phase you said
during strength
so your strength would be pretty stable
but the most you should lose
is half a percent which means if you
weigh 200 pounds don't lose more than
about a pound a week
if you are a strength athlete especially
if you're dieting
during a strength phase this means that
if you need to make a certain weight
class
you need to think about that shit way
far in advance if you're
if you have a five-week strength phase
let's say 10 week strength
block and you have to lose 15 pounds and
you weigh 200 pounds
that's a 0.75 per week weight loss
that's not going to cut it
you will pay chances are you might be
able to get away with it
you'll probably pay dearly and you'll
pay in a reduced level of strength can
you imagine you tell people you train
for strength you say to people i've got
a power for me coming up
at the beginning of your strength phase
the beginning you were x strong
and at the end your x minus something
strong good god
just psychologically it has to be a huge
mind fucker i'm gonna do this meat and
be weaker than ever
but i'll be down 15 pounds that's not
why you got into the sport
do it during a hypertrophy phase then
during strength feed yourself at
maintenance to give yourself the best
possible
ability now peaking cutting during
peaking
the purpose of peaking is to maximize
your performance
while minimizing your fatigue what does
a fat loss diet do
it shits on your performance and
escalates your fatigue like crazy it's
literally backwards
so when people are diving into a
powerlifting meet like they're doing
peaking face training at a deficit
stupid idea think ahead what you want to
do is get to within one to three percent
of the weight class you need to
ideally at the end of the last
hypertrophy phase
possibly if you're very careful and you
know the trade-offs at the end of the
last
strength phase during peaking it's
maintenance eating
period give that some thought see you
guys next time for the next lecture
