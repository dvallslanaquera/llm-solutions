all right what's going on guys so in
this video i want to talk about clean
eating now let me start by saying that
if you follow clean eating yourself
and it's been working well for you and
it's something you feel like you can
happily stick to
that's totally fine i do think that
nutrition is very individual
so the problems i'm going to outline
here may or may not all apply to all of
you but i do think that there certainly
are better approaches to dieting that
many people would benefit from hearing
about
because despite its many drawbacks clean
eating is still extremely popular in the
fitness industry today
this was shown just last month in a new
survey covered in the latest issue of
the mass research review
of over a thousand young people aged 14
to 24.
now 88 of people viewed clean eating as
positive so only 12
saw it as negative in fact 71 of people
viewed clean eating as entirely healthy
with no unhealthy or harmful features so
clearly most people
probably including many of you still
think clean eating is a good idea
and i'll admit that on the surface it
really does seem like an obviously
reasonable approach
you just get rid of any dirty junk foods
and instead eat clean
nutritious whole foods what could be the
problem with that well
even though it seems to make sense on
the surface as we'll see i think the
devil is in the details
so the first issue is that no one seems
to agree on what clean eating actually
means and this has very practical
implications if you talk to your typical
bodybuilder they'll give you a short
list of six or seven foods
something like chicken egg whites brown
rice sweet potato oatmeal and protein
powder
and even with a list this short you
might already start to notice some
contradictions
people say a main criterion of counting
as clean as being unprocessed
whole or natural yet protein powder
almost always makes the list
despite being very highly processed
refined and synthetic
oatmeal undergoes extensive processing
as well now even though it's still
totally arbitrary i can see why brown
rice gets the clean label while white
rice doesn't because white rice goes
through some additional processing
to mill out the bran and the germ
stripping away some b vitamins and fiber
in the process
but then as pointed out in the mass
write-up it doesn't make sense why sweet
potatoes get the clean label while white
potatoes don't
because neither sweet potatoes nor white
potatoes are milled or processed
so it doesn't make sense for sweet
potatoes to be any cleaner than white
potatoes
other than the fact that the white color
reminds people of white rice or white
bread
which are more highly processed than
their browner counterparts in fact white
potatoes could be argued as being one of
the best
fat loss foods out there because of how
incredibly satiating they are per
calorie
one study found that when compared to
other common carbohydrate sources
potatoes are by far the most satiating
so what counts as clean
clearly depends on who you ask and what
diet they follow if you follow keto you
might say
all carbs are dirty if you follow paleo
you might say grains and dairy are bad
but meats and veggies are fine and this
is a problem because as dr holm said in
the latest mass review
if you tried to eat clean according to
every group's definition you'd have an
empty plate now this might seem like i'm
just nitpicking or playing semantics but
not being able to clearly define
what the approach actually entails makes
it hard to give dietary guidelines based
on sound nutritional principles
and can end up causing some pretty
serious issues as we'll see
so the second problem i notice with
clean eating especially when it comes to
fat loss is that even if it technically
works which it can it's still needlessly
inconvenient
for most people a true commitment to
clean eating means you're not able to
partake in special occasions or enjoy
dinners with friends or family
because what's on the menu is off limits
and that's kind of a shame because you
can miss out on a lot of life
for no reason since science tells us
that it's perfectly fine to be flexible
with your diet
and enjoy a variety of foods even some
processed junk foods
and you'll still lose fat just as well
as long as you're in the same
net caloric deficit over time and eating
enough protein
in fact it's actually better than that
being more flexible with your diet isn't
just
good enough for fat loss research tells
us that it's likely better than clean
eating
which leads me to problem number three
clean eating just isn't the most
effective strategy for long-term fat
loss
for most people one study from 2012 gave
two groups the same diet
except one group wasn't allowed to eat
bread and the other group was
clean eaters especially if they follow
paleo aquito might expect the group
without bread to do better
but in reality after 16 weeks both
groups lost the same amount of fat
but the group that was told to cut out
the bread had way more subjects drop out
part way through
they just couldn't stick to the diet as
well so over the long term the more
foods you make
off limits the harder it'll be to
consistently follow through this is
supported by other research
as well for example this study examined
what they called flexible control versus
rigid control flexible control basically
means you're flexible with how you
schedule your meals
you're flexible with your weight loss
timeline and you take a non-dichotomous
view of foods
so you don't see foods as either good or
bad or clean or dirty
rigid control means the opposite you
have rigid timelines you often try to
diet as fast as possible
and you look at foods as being either
good or bad so there are foods you can
eat
and others that you can't and as it
turns out flexible control was
associated with lower body mass index
less binge eating and better weight loss
over a one year program then when the
same researchers did a follow-up three
years later
they found that flexible control was
better at maintaining weight loss after
three years as well and this shouldn't
be surprising the strictest clean eaters
are pre-contest bodybuilders
and they're the perfect example of
people who see cyclical not sustainable
weight loss
almost without exception bodybuilders
will lose fat for several weeks leading
up to a competition
and then spend the rest of the year
being at a higher body fat percentage so
even if we just ignore the research and
look at the best anecdotes
clean eating still doesn't bode well for
sustainable long-term fat loss
all right the fourth issue with clean
eating is that it can easily lead to
disordered eating
clean eating implies that if there are
good foods there must also be
bad foods and this is where it can start
to go wrong for a lot of people
psychologically
research shows that black and white
thinking about food can cause orthorexia
where you become obsessed with only
eating foods you think are clean or
healthy
and other potentially more severe eating
disorders as well
in 2002 stuart and colleagues found that
rigid dieting strategies like clean
eating
but not flexible dieting strategies were
associated with eating disorder symptoms
and a new paper from 2020 looking at how
different eating patterns relate to
binge eating and over 1300 subjects
found that inflexible eating beliefs and
high rigid restraint
were more likely to be associated with
recurrent binge eating
now that doesn't mean that so-called
flexible dieting or if it fits your
macros is a silver bullet either
just because you track your macros and
occasionally squeeze a pop tart into
your carb count
it doesn't mean you've immunized
yourself from these potential
psychological pitfalls but just simply
acknowledging that there really is no
such thing as a
bad food is a good place to start as the
mass review says no food you eat
independent of the amount or frequency
that you consume it has a measurable
negative effect on you
and junk foods that are high calorie
highly processed highly palatable and
low in micronutrients
are only problematic if they dominate
your diet and this brings me to the
final problem that i see with clean
eating
even though it's touted as being
extremely healthy it probably
isn't as healthy as you think now to be
clear of course there are foods that
promote good health
like fruits and vegetables and foods
that when eaten too much
and too often can lead to health
problems like ice cream and french fries
the thing clean eaters often miss is the
fact that the dose
always makes the poison even the most
toxic and dangerous substance on earth
is only actually harmful at a given dose
and even water the most essential
component to life
will kill you at a high enough dose it's
no different with ice cream and french
fries
what really matters is how much of that
junk food you're eating
and what the rest of your diet looks
like and if maximizing your health is
your main goal
extreme clean eating isn't the best
solution depending on just how many
foods you eliminate
you can easily run into nutrient
deficiencies this was shown in studies
from kleiner and colleagues which found
that male bodybuilders only had 46
percent of the rda for vitamin d
and women hit just 52 for calcium while
also being deficient in zinc
copper and chromium so unless you
carefully monitor your vitamin and
mineral intake
eliminating foods or food groups is an
easy way to miss out on key nutrients
for health
so with all those things in mind what do
i actually recommend well first of all i
like helm's suggestion that rather than
excluding bad foods
focus more on including nutrient dense
foods so yeah do make an effort to eat
more fruits vegetables grains and
healthy fats
but don't feel like you have to totally
eliminate all junk foods
or any specific foods from your diet and
that's true whether your main goal is
health
fat loss or both now when it comes to
fat loss we know that there really
aren't any magic
fat burning foods except kiwis just like
there aren't any magic fat storing foods
ultimately fat loss comes down to
putting yourself in a net caloric
deficit over time
and to a lesser extent eating enough
protein people often try to mystify fat
loss because it's more marketable when
it's mysterious
but it really is that simple every diet
that's ever succeeded at causing fat
loss has
one defining feature in common a caloric
deficit so for some people
tracking caloric intake protein intake
and optionally macronutrient intake
depending on how detailed you want to
get
will be the best strategy i personally
periodically track my intake using an
app like myfitnesspal
to make sure i'm in the right ballpark
with my calories and my macros
in this way if i want to fit some junk
food in my diet that would be off limits
on a clean eating plan
i can do that by just fitting it into my
calorie or macro targets
without compromising my results at all
but of course it isn't that active
tracking that causes fat loss and there
are no
magic macros either it's simply one way
of ensuring that you are in fact eating
an appropriate number of calories for
your goal
so you obviously don't need to track
calories or macros to lose fat
it just works better at keeping some
people on track while still allowing for
flexibility and variety in the actual
food choices
for others a more auto regulated
approach will be just as or more
effective
without the same bother of having to
track everything this is something i'd
need a full video to do justice so you
guys can just let me know if that's
something you'd like to hear me cover in
more detail
in the future but very quickly three
things to focus on are prioritizing
nutrient dense
minimally processed whole foods but not
eliminating foods entirely you want to
be more consistent with your meals
when you try to eat similar meals at
similar times while also being flexible
enough to realize that it doesn't really
matter if you miss a meal or if you eat
something different occasionally and
then use a body scale
and progress photos to track your
progress over time and i think i'm going
to leave it there for this one
if you guys would like a much more
thorough breakdown of the practical
elements of what i recommend for
any goal whether it be losing fat
building muscle or doing both at the
same time
i'd recommend checking out my 17 chapter
ultimate guide to body recomposition
which i'll link down below and as you
can probably tell a lot of the info in
this video came from this month's issue
of the mass research review which i'll
leave an affiliate link to
down below as well if you guys would
like to check that out and help support
me in the process
i would say the best way to stay up to
date with the research on training and
nutrition
is to simply just subscribe to mass and
you can also get there on my website so
