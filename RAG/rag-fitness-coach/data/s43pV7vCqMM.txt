keep going for 1.6 miles
hi my name is charlie um follow me
online my online fans it's only 4.99 a
month that's pretty cheap i know
i like to give you value hey folks we're
here to kick off a whole week
of mass gain training with myself
ifbb pro jared feather and charlie jung
we're here in orlando florida during the
olympia we're going to be filming with a
bunch of other people of course
but we're going to take you guys through
a whole week of our training
today's training is an am and a pm
session the am session
is bush emphasis that's what we're going
to be doing now
chest emphasis push with a row at the
end
so we're going to do something like some
kind of flying movement
and then some kind of pressing movement
after and then do
some rows after that that's
on the door on my left on the door on my
right
is going to be our pm session that's
tricep emphasis
and vertical pull let us enter the door
on the left
and begin to get our chests enormous
all right folks the first exercise is
going to be
machine flies no particular attachment
to machine flies suggest one of the many
good options
this particular machine at this gym
happened to be very very good awesome
force curve
which means at the bottom it was real
real tough and at the top it was quite
easy so we got an awesome peak
contraction every single time
the rep range here is going to be
anywhere between oh sets of 5
to 15 reps that means we're getting
plenty of volume but it's pretty heavy
the machine flies first here you could
say okay well
why don't we do a compound press that
gets us a better raw stimulus mags do we
could have done that
but we actually want to save our
shoulders and triceps just a little bit
and save our joint integrity just a
little bit because later today
we're going to be doing a tricep focus
pushing workout that still
uses shoulder joints elbow joints front
delts and triceps a ton
so we kind of use the pre-exhaust here
to make sure the chest takes the brunt
of the effort
and leaves all the other stuff for us to
make sure
that it is still very useful very ready
to have another good pushing workout
later today

oh
all right folks second exercise the
incline prime
press nothing super magical about this
machine we just saw it was really cool
since we're traveling
we're gonna include some stuff we
usually don't do um you can find a smith
machine
basically anywhere but this is a pretty
rare machine uh
really good compound pushing movement
slow and controlled on the way down
well executed on the way up sets of well
you know
something like 5 to 10 reps pretty
hardcore pretty heavy
the chest oftentimes likes high
resistance
so here we go

hi folks representing jared feather here
with his pioneer custom
ifbb pro rp belt
jared congratulations thank you guys
there you go man
get big and strong
thanks matt appreciate it
next up last for this monday am workout
is a horizontal rowing variant of some
kind luckily for us
we have access at this gym to a prime
horizontal row machine
which is awesome awesome awesome because
if you load it properly
with more of the weight in the back of
the setup you can get
really really gnarly forces at the
stretch
which is independently good for
hypertrophy and bonus points it's
really really low forces at the peak
contraction which can really allow you
to exaggerate that peak contraction arch
your back
pull in your scapulae and really hit the
rhomboids
and the middle traps and all those other
muscles that usually
just wouldn't be able to be leveraged to
produce a ton of force for very long
if the weight was so heavy that we could
barely hold at the chest for a split
second so
here we go probably going to do about
four or five sets of here
in the row you think well hold on isn't
it a chess state well we sort of have
three days in which we train back we're
really prioritizing back this macro
cycle
and we do a row in the am here monday
we're gonna be doing a vertical pulling
movement
just one in the pm later today and then
on wednesday and then saturday we have
two specific back workouts
so basically monday still technically a
back day
but it's back burner stuff last exercise
of each day
and hey look four or five sets each time
that's like
eight to ten sets on a monday for back
that adds up
[Music]
alright folks thanks for joining in we
are spent
but later today in the pm we're gonna
come back
and do a triceps emphasis push and
finish off the back
with vertical pulling see you then
