hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
today's topic is fatigue
indicators and how to use them for
strength
and or hypertrophy training here is the
thing
if you want a ton more detail that i'm
going to give in this relatively short
video just a grand tour
there's an article on the internet i
believe it is on
juggernaut training systems which is an
excellent site by the way a very good
friend chad wesley smith runs it
their youtube is amazing so i'd
absolutely subscribe to that or at least
give some videos some looks
and on their website there's an article
called fatigue indicators and how to use
them it's by myself
and dr james hoffman also of rp you've
probably seen him on the webinar in a
bunch of other videos
we wrote that together a while ago it's
aged pretty well
that's the super fine point detail so
here i'm going to give a grand tour but
if you have any specific questions of
course you can shoot them in the
description and
somebody may very well answer them or
sorry shoot them in the comments and
edit the description on the video but uh
at the end of the day i think it would
be really really cool if you guys want
to check out that article
every time you click on an article um
the russian cia gets a scent
or whatever so you're going to be
tipping the scales of global balance
into evil but before we do that let's
check out fatigue indicators and how to
use them there are
three categories of fatigue indicators
basically things signs in your training
that you know
fatigue is accumulating to the point
where it's time to back off
whether it's through recovery sessions
light sessions technique sessions
deloads more days off
more food something to handle the
fatigue because it's getting out of hand
that
fatigue out of hand point is
the point we're looking for but we have
three sort of time points around that
that we can be intelligent about
there are leading indicators that start
to red flag
before fatigue actually hits you in a
way that interferes with productive
training because that's our point
so we have leading indicators happen
before we have concurrent indicators
that tell you like
now is when it's probably time to deload
really soon
and then we have lagging indicators that
either
tell you okay it's real close slash here
the time to deload and or if you feel a
lot of them together
or perceive a lot of them together
there's a decent chance that like
you're overreaching now and now is the
time to pull back
because then you get a functional
overreaching super compensation boost
and then you get better but if you
ignore the lagging indicators
after this sort of peak of fatigue has
occurred any more fatigue on top of that
if you just keep going
and don't address the fatigue could land
you into non-functional overreaching
which means you the super compensatory
effect just brings you back up to normal
or worse
or it could start you on the road if
you're really for weeks and weeks ignore
it to over training and all these other
really bad things injury and so so on
and so forth you don't want any of that
so here's the deal
let's start with leading indicators
first some of these leading indicators
are also causes but if you're using them
to cause higher fatigue
then there are also indicators that have
cheek is coming because like you know
x yields y right so here's the deal your
previous days
either yesterdays or several days
prior to that nutrition is a leading
indicator of higher fatigue
if your nutrition sucked in the last
several days like you missed tons of
meals you ate way too few calories but
you're still training super hard
you are going to have a fatigue bump
soon okay
plain and simple right and that fatigue
bump could be large
next one is several previous days
stress and recovery management let's say
you spent several days
fighting with your parents or you spent
several days like worrying about if
you're going to get into college and
that letter hasn't come in a mail what
the hell is going on
or you haven't slept a ton so on and so
forth your fatigue will be skyrocketing
soon even even if you don't know if you
sort of feel normal now
these leading indicators remember it's
never one for one there's never a
guarantee that okay
this indicator is coming so fatigue is
going to be high but watch out
okay they're like little red indicator
lights and like a a submarine they start
to go off it might not be the end of the
world but you're going to look at them
ships because they might be telling you
something
next one is the previous week's training
volume and intensity
so if in the last week you crushed it
don't expect
fatigue to just be blah this week it's
going to go up because fatigue is
cumulative right
let's say you were doing a normal
program and you had some friends visit
you for a week and stay with you
and they're all muscle building friends
so muscle building friends tm
right and you go in the gym you fuck
crush it you know how you
around your boys around your ladies you
get after so
the next week they all leave and you're
alone and it's maybe another week of
training
no deload don't expect to be like 100
hunky-dory like that's just going to
mess you up right so know that when you
make a huge
inroad into training volume and
intensity and so on and so forth
you're going to be paying for it in a
delayed fashion just don't let it
surprise you
right next one these are actual
uh things you can perceive there's not
things you are doing they're not causes
of fatigue
they are indicators of fatigue in a pure
sense okay
technical coordination and learning
proficiency this is easy to do
especially if you play another sport
like for example i do brazilian jiu
jitsu as well as hypertrophy
and strength training and mostly i
purchase for training now
i know that when i'm starting to feel
real sloppy in jiu jitsu learning
techniques or executing them
i'm still good for hyper i'm not
overreached on hypertrophy or strength
mechanisms
but it's coming okay because uh
technique
ability to learn and to execute is a
very very fatigue sensitive
so your fatigue is climbing it pings
your technical ability first
and then it'll ping your ability to add
muscle and or get stronger later
but it's not that much later a week or
two later so when your technique starts
to fall apart
it's okay if you're not a technique
athlete you just kind of know if you
just feel like sort of uncoordinated
even at the gym
you just feel less athletic even though
you're still hitting pr's and stuff
just know that that might be an
indicator that your fatigue is going to
be really high really soon
another one this one you can test we use
it a lot
with athletes that are not physique
athletes sport performance athletes jump
height
okay jump height uh because speed and
explosiveness is again more sensitive to
fatigue
than strength and hypertrophy then uh
what ends up happening is if your jump
height starts to crest and come down
it's probably a chance that you're
excessively fatigued
soon and it's going to be time to back
off so now if you're training athletes
that are explosive athletes and their
training is explosive this when jump
height
is starting to fall off that's not a
leading fatigue indicator that's a
concurrent fatigue indicator it's
already happening
okay but for strength hypertrophy
explosiveness is not a requisite
and you can still pass the point of
fatigue where
where explosiveness starts to fall off
there's still more volume and intensity
you can add and more fatigue
in which it's productive to train so you
don't have to stop but just know it's
coming soon if you're training for
strength and hypertrophy
next concurrent indicators how do you
know
you're experiencing fatigue now because
you may have a very legitimate question
of like
okay uh do i have too high fatigue right
now
to continue to train productively and
strength training it's pretty easy i'll
see why in a sec
and i purchase training it's not
immediately intuitive but we'll explain
in a bit so
first is bar uh movement velocity if
you're not moving weights as fast as you
were
it probably means that especially
weights you're used to
like you get under 315 as your last
warrant for the squat and you're
grinding it it's slow you're like
feel like i have a lot of fatigue now
that may next set may go well but it may
not
even if you're in working sets the bar
speed is really low you have to really
grind
chances are your fatigue is pretty high
and it's pretty soon time to back off
right next one this is a bit subjective
but if you're an advanced trainee you're
honest with yourself you get really good
at this
is what we call bar weight feeling or
perception of effort right like
if you unrack 225 you usually like all
right
sweet on rack 225 and you're like
and even if your velocity is good you're
like that felt heavy as fuck
five times out of ten no big deal the
next set feels fine and everything is
great
but the other five times out of ten it's
a sign that maybe
you know maybe your fatigue is rising
right
the ultimate sign comes next and that is
actual performance so in strength is
really easy as soon as you undershoot
your pr that you were trying to hit
you're underperforming right and maybe
that's due to fatigue maybe it's a bad
day
do you come in later that week and try
the same movement pattern
like front squats sucked monday if
squats
high bar back squats suck again thursday
you probably have excessive fatigue it's
not just a one time thing
right reps per set versus capability
load versus reps versus uh your ability
to do them versus rir for example
in the gym for hypertrophy training is
the gold standard for how to measure
fatigue so for example
if you hit 315 for sets of 10 roughly
last week and then this week you hit 320
for sets of 10. like you're good to go
you're still getting stronger awesome
if you hit 325 this week and it's a set
of 10 then
8 then 776 like ah
definitely underperformed okay why i'm
not sure it could be cumulative fatigue
maybe not now if you have all this other
stuff going on and leading indicators
happened a week ago you're pretty sure
it's cumulative fatigue but maybe
you just have that you try it again
later in the later in the week say
muscle group
right or even more telling a different
muscle group and you still underperform
like you try you know later that week
you're supposed to leg press
450 for sets of 10 and you got like a
set of eight and then six and three and
you're like i can't even i'm not going
to be able to one or end this
like any kind of fall off and
performance doesn't have to be big any
fall off of performance where you're
really trying your hardest
is almost always indicative of excessive
fatigue and a time to back off deload
and then push back up again right lastly
and this one can be done for folks
that have a hard time telling how
they're performing maybe like uh
somebody like a wrestler how are you
performing it's tough to tell
you go against the same guys in training
all the time and you don't know if
they're going hard or you're going
easy so on and so forth grip strength
can be used in that circumstance
so if you have a gripper a grip
dynamometer they're really super cheap
and you just test your grip strength
maybe every day in the morning or
something like that and we're up a
little bit and test your grip or like
three times a week
if your grip strength starts to uh
starts to go down that probably means
you're under recovering not for sure but
it's
definitely another piece of the puzzle
lastly and i do mean lastly
are the lagging indicators again these
indicate
that there's a good chance not on a
percent that you're already well into a
very high fatigue state that's no longer
optimally productive for hypertrophy and
strength training
and now is the time like now now like
today or tomorrow not like in a week
to deload right or to take an active
rest phase or at least some
recovery sessions something to back away
in the fatigue here we go
heart rate variables people ask this
question all the time like what about
hrv what about
all these all this heart rate stuff uh
they work right except they don't work
for every individual all the time so
they're better used on teams
and also a lot of times by the time
they're notably off
you could have told anyone in the world
you were crushed like you're weak into
shitting the bed and hitting zero pr's
and being sore everywhere and your
joints all fucked up
your hrv app is like hey you might be
overdoing it you're like
thanks okay but not always
and if your heart revealability is off
it could be nothing but if the other
signs are there
then you know it's kind of time because
sometimes you do a decent
week and you sort of hit some decent
pr's but you know it was really tough
you basically run through you could ask
like
should i train this next week super hard
or should i take a d-load and like
during that weekend
your hrv starts to go sort of off the
charts and your heart rate
monitoring is like oh something's up
you're like uh okay okay
with this piece of evidence remember
we're using multiple measures at the
same time
with this piece of evidence maybe i'm
not going to push it super hard maybe
it's time to back off
right another one desire to train this
one
can be a leading indicator a concurrent
indicator and a lagging indicator but
for
this video as targeted for super
intellectual hardcore lifters
okay folks motherfuckers like you that
want it
okay they're addicted to training that's
why the fuck you're spending your free
time watching dumbass youtube videos and
ranting about training science right
because you want the shit bad
so for you for your training desire to
fall off some real deep shadows has to
be happening
and high fatigue is number one culprit
so like if you
are like thinking about going to the gym
next week and you've done six
incrementally harder
uh weeks and you're like thinking about
going to the gym and you're like ugh
someone like shows you a picture of a
hack squat you're like no
no that hurt me last week like show me
where it hurt you point to your quads
uh if that's the case if you really uh
you usually love to train you're
confused like you even have to admit it
to yourself like do i really not want to
go to the gym what the hell is wrong
with me
well nine times out of ten it's gonna be
high fatigue and that means your fatigue
is already
very very high right if you're super
dedicated if you're not super dedicated
it's a leading indicator
right or no indicator at all because you
could always just not want to train then
like probably not watching this video so
if your desire to train starting to fall
off and you're a serious lifter
um deloading is almost always a good
idea of some kind reducing the volume
intensity so on and so forth
mood disturbances you start to like get
catty with people like
like that you're sort of uncomfortable
and anxious all the time along with
these other factors can
can be a conclusion that you're just
really really uh pretty overreached
appetite suppression uh a real big one
is like when you're in a hypocaloric
diet and you're pretty hungry
and then five weeks into an accumulation
phase you're not hungry anymore even
though you're the lowest calories ever
gee whiz you're probably real deep in
the hole right and a lot of times your
performance and the other metrics
reflect this as well
also happens on mass gaining and it
sucks on masking because it's kind of
like a benefit on cutting
which just kind of makes it dangerous
because you're like i'm just going to
keep overtraining
and i'll never want to eat again i'll
get results except not right because
you're going to just
spill over and nothing is going to
happen when you quit right or you get
hurt
on massing this is a pretty clear one
like if your appetite suppression starts
to occur
and it's just objectively a lot of food
okay no big deal it doesn't mean
anything
but if it's a food you've eaten before
it's not objectively that much and
you're like i should be able to finish
this
and your training volume has been
climbing it's really high and you have a
lot of these other things going on and
your appetite is suppressed and you
don't know why
the fatigue is probably why it's and and
it's a weird form of appetite
suppression too
because you look at food and you're like
i can't eat that i don't want to eat
anything you kind of shut down your body
recedes into itself not a good sign
for sustained training you definitely
want to back off at that point
a lot of times with all these mood
appetite come sleep disturbances
your sleep is just of a low quality a
lot of tossing and turning a lot of
waking up
not a lot of intervals in the night
where you wake up and you're like
oh i just had like a ball or a 50-hour
dream it seemed like i was in another
universe and i felt like i was in the
deepest sleep ever
the opposite of that like it just it's
like the equivalent of like
sleeping on a bus or a plane you slept
like that quality in your bed
not good or inability to fall asleep at
night or you wake up or this is a really
big one
you wake up really early in the morning
you can't go back to sleep you're just
like
wake up like vampire style you're like
and you're already anxious
not a good sign illness this one comes
later earlier
remember fatigue is cumulative and when
your body is busy trying to fix itself
in the fatigue
its immune system is weaker and is more
apt to be
overwhelmed short term at least by
pathogens so when you get really sick
and this is like a super predictable
thing a lot of athletes and they're
overreaching prior to big competitions
they'll predictably get like a minor
head cold during
right when they crest into the
overreaching and they start deloading
okay
a lot of times the illness actually
comes after you start to deload like you
start to deal and then you get sick
you're like what the fuck first of all
good news
you don't do hardly anything in a d-load
find being sick
right it's the best time to be sick i'll
tell you that because being sick during
your accumulation phase sucks or you're
actually training
uh that's just how it works when you
finally relax your sympathetic nervous
system and all your catecholamines and
fight-or-flight hormones kind of
taper down and then your body's like oh
all right immune systems destroy
everything because we've been dealing
with this cold virus for four or five
days we haven't been doing shit about
and then you get sick and so on and so
forth so i'll tell you this if you train
harder and harder and harder
and you got sick you ask yourself the
question of like should i keep going no
no don't keep going delahud let your
body recover and relax get over the
illness and then you can work back in no
problem right there's always a long view
there
here's some that you don't want to
affect you these are definitely lagging
wear and tear injuries okay you're
ignoring your body ignoring your body
ignoring your body your knees start to
hurt your right knee
and it's worse and worse and worse and
all these other things happen but you
sort of work through them and now you
have a bum knee
and it's going to take maybe months to
fix a bad idea
the idea of leading indicators and
concurrent indicators
is to never have to have lagging
indicators and because some of them are
nasty
some of them aren't just indicators
they're shit that's happening to you now
you got to deal with it
deal with it for a while lastly and this
is
injury is probably least as bad but this
is i think tied for worst
actual competition performance okay you
step on the power lifting platform
and you total 50 pounds under your last
best having had tons of these signs
and someone's like hey how'd your meat
go and you're like bad but i could have
told you that was going to happen
because i just ignored every sign i was
an idiot and i came into the meat
overreached
the idea behind these fatigue fatigue
indicators and how to use them
is note when the leading indicators are
arising
and be on the lookout then when the
concurrent indicators start to hit
plan that very soon after several days
after you begin to reduce fatigue
somehow usually in a deload or
taper or active rest or whatever and
then
if you ever see lagging indicators in
the mix
let's say you're on a wednesday you had
planned a train
thursday friday saturday rest sunday and
then the next week was a deload
let's say you're starting to hit a lot
of lagging indicators
on that wednesday there's a good
thought process to be had about just
starting to deload
thursday because you're deep in the ship
you very likely will be just fine
waiting
grinding out and deloading starting
sunday sure
but there's a even chance uh not a 50 50
chance but
a decent chance that you'll get sick or
that you'll start to get wear and tear
injuries or just like an acute injury
like a fuck my adductor or some shit
like that
or whatever it is you're prepping for
and training for doesn't go as well
freezing wanted
that's the stuff we want to avoid so we
want to be keen we want to note this we
don't want to be paranoid like oh my god
more weight feeling like
ultimately your performance in the gym
is the number one thing that matters if
you're still hitting pr's
you're good to go right fundamentally
but you can use more than just that to
be known to ready
to deload know when to deload and know
when look maybe the deal is going to
have to happen sooner than i planned
give that some thought read that article
we're going to link it in the
description
see you next time for the next video
you
