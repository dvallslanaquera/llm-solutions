hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
let's try to get some common ground
and learn or practice how to design
a powerlifting training program this is
the beginning of a video series
that we will teach you guys how to
design a powerlifting hypertrophy
program to put on the muscle size to be
strong for powerlifting
then we'll have a video about how to
take your powerlifting designed program
and auto regulated and altered and
change it actually running it
make all the uh necessary changes and
updates
and to actually have it go super well
teach you how to deload teach you how to
write the next one and then
we're gonna have two videos on how to
design and then implement
a strength program for the sport of
powerlifting and
lastly the last two videos of the six
video series we'll have
a peaking program one on design one on
implementation
sounds cool let's get strong let's get
started
so we're going to have a whole bunch of
stuff to talk about here
so first up what's the purpose of a
powerlifting hypertrophy program because
hypertrophy is for muscle growth
powerlifting for strength i promise
we'll figure that out
next what we have to know before we get
started actually building a program
then we figure out where the training
sessions are going to be through the
week
where the exercise selection is going to
be within each training session
then we have to select the loading range
freeze exercise basically how heavy the
exercises are
select the relative effort to begin with
so like how hard are we going in that
first week
and then of course select the initial
volume of how many sets of all that
we're going to do
and then we're going to talk about what
the next video is going to cover so
without further ado what is the purpose
of a power lifting hypertrophy program
well it's to grow muscles bigger so that
we can later optimize
and taking those big muscles and making
them stronger it improves your total
because bigger muscles are generally
stronger especially when they're
neurologically adept at actually lifting
and this doesn't just mean hypertrophy
like we get you big forms big side delts
and biceps we mean power lifting
specific hypertrophy which means
training the muscles that actually
contribute most
to the three lifts specifically quads
spinal erectors hamstrings triceps
chest that kind of stuff that actually
contributes big time
to the lifts some muscles contribute
somewhat but less so we're going to be
biasing our program
a little bit differently which is to say
if you're doing a hypertrophy program
for the sake of physique it's going to
look similar to a power lifting aperture
program but it's going to be different
in notable ways
specifically with the muscles that we're
prioritizing and the muscles that we're
not
next can you not do a hypertrophy
program for powerlifting can you just
train for strength
doesn't strength training add
muscularity well yeah it actually does
but not at optimal rates it turns out
it's probably better to grow muscles
specifically for growing them or train
them specifically for growth
then spend time in strength training
making those muscles stronger and
repeating those cycles
that's the best way to get stronger over
time because muscle size
is such a huge element in strength and
training specifically for size
grows your muscles so much faster than
training just for strength
and that's especially true when just a
few muscle size
is holding you back from being super
strong so for example in the bench press
you have really big ass pecs
that respond really well to strength
training and they grow fine and they're
not a limiting factor
but your triceps could be like a little
on the small side you're really having
trouble with lockouts
and you're like well i wish my triceps
were stronger and then people look at
them and your coach looks at them and
you look at them you're like
you know what their number one thing is
they're actually for their size pretty
fucking strong
just not big enough that's the real
problem so
maybe especially if a muscle group is
too small to be competing with the other
muscle groups to contribute to a major
lift
if you bring up the size of that
limiting factor muscle group it can have
a huge
impact on your performance right now
once you've notably grown
the desired muscles that you wanted in a
logical fashion you've gone through a
few hypertrophy phases at least one
then you can transition to a strength
phase make those muscles stronger and
then later in the peaking phase
to take those strong muscles and allow
them to display their best powerlifting
performance we'll get to all of that
later in the next couple of videos but
for now
what do we have to know before we start
designing a hypertrophy program for
power lifting
first you got to know how many days a
week you want to train
and uh we'll we'll cover the specifics
of that
we have to cover what muscles and lifts
you want to bring up because
it's totally fine to do a general
program that's that's completely fine
but a lot of times you're like you know
what i really need my quads and glutes
and hamstrings are
fucking enormous relative to my size my
squat and nettle for shooting up like
crazy
things like i kind of have a bird chest
or it is
it's nice to use a bird chest bird chest
is actually enormous like uh
there's a completely wrong analogy there
but like i kind of have this little
little chest here and my triceps aren't
that big and my shoulders aren't too big
and like yeah i can neurologically make
the muscles i have for benching stronger
and that'll work
but i really just need size so when you
do a hypertrophy program it may very
well be focused on the muscles that do
bench press or do the squat or the
deadlift and not just all of them
at the same time so you might do
something on the back burner not train
muscles
certain muscles with a lot of volume
train others with a lot to get that
particular mix that you need for your
body to get you the best possible
results
and of course we need to know what the
best exercises are for each muscle group
for you to use and that comes from
essentially two factors first
you want the exercise to have good
stimulus to fatigue ratio
if you want to know what that is if you
haven't seen any of these videos before
just
go in our search bar or just in our
playlist videos or just go into search
bar and type in mike israel sfr stimulus
fatigue ratio
you get a ton of awesome lectures some
of them are short to the point about
what that actually is but basically like
does the exercise give you a lot of good
stuff for a small return on fatigue
small fatigue cost that's basically what
it is so the exercises have to be pretty
good
and here's the big difference between
these exercises and pure hypertrophy
exercises
they have to have good strength transfer
which is to say that the exercises you
choose
have to be the ones that if you get
strong on them and if you grow muscle
using them
it makes you a much better squatter
bench press or a deadlifter versus those
other exercises where if you get big and
strong and then
yeah it makes you a better squatter
bench pressure deadlifter but not nearly
as much as certain other exercises we'll
get to all that in a little bit more
in specifics so training session
assignment
first if you want the best results
for hyper powerlifting my humble
recommendation
is at least four sessions per week
for a serious run you can do up to six
if you like if you can recover if you
have the time if you have the priorities
but i've talked to some people for like
i really want to get bigger for
powerlifting
i train three days a week or i train two
days a week what do you think man that's
just not gonna be you're not gonna be
able to
squeeze in enough high quality volume
like working sets that are actually
heavy and make you big and strong
um unless you do four days a week so
four days minimum
five it can be five days it can be six
days i wouldn't recommend more than six
because the fatigue is just going to be
excessive
so that's the number of days per week
and
the sessions should address each muscle
group slash movement category like
pushing and pulling and squatting
two to four times per week and of course
with enough time between each session
for you to heal for the next one so if
you're like yeah i squat you know four
days a week and i say like are you
healing between sessions you're like no
i'm like completely devastated by
session number three like
maybe that's not a good idea so you
wanna pulse the sessions in
session rest recover session rest
recover sesh session rest recover rest
so on and so forth and at some point you
know your proclivity to recover
from different lifts is different so
deadlifting you may only realistically
recover from heavy dead lifting once a
week so you only train deadlift once a
week
because it's the exception benching you
can train two to three two to four times
a week
squatting movements or leg movements
again like maybe two to three times a
week so on and so forth it's all
individualized at this point
now there's another concern here which
is a little bit different than pure
hypertrophy training for physique
systemic fatigue is a real big deal in
power lifting because you're going super
super heavy even during hypertrophy
you're going
or a quick preview you're doing sets of
5 to 10 sometimes 5 to 12
reps that's going to take a lot out of
you also the lifts you're going to
choose are the ones
that transfer best to powerlifting
itself which is a lot of compound
hardcore lifts
not isolation lifts that have really low
levels of fatigue
and you need as a powerlifting
performance
athlete you need to perform well every
single session you can't have sessions
where like yeah i didn't get strong with
that session but i still drove
a muscle growth stimulus you got to get
stronger and stronger and stronger so
you can't sandwich sessions together a
lot especially sessions that
systemically fatigue you so if you have
a really big
bench workout a really big squat workout
or a big deadlift workout and then a
smaller accessory workout
that small accessory workout you can put
after one of the workouts
but generally you want to keep your big
workouts more separated
so maybe monday big bench workout so
wednesday big squat workout
uh you know friday or saturday big
deadlift workout
so on and so forth you don't want to
have a situation and i've actually seen
programs written like this
where it's like monday tuesday wednesday
squat bench press deadlift
and then rest the rest of the week or
you know thursday something in the rest
that's not a good idea you want more of
a spread as a power lifter because every
time you come to train
you want to be pretty fresh as fresh as
you can be while still getting in the
work
right so quick sample i'm not going to
blab about it too much because you can
just pause the video you'll see it right
on your screen
but we have monday you know we do squats
leg focus
wednesday bench and some upper body work
friday deadlifts and squats we've got
deadlift just one time a week in this
example you can do it more
uh squats twice a week because there's a
lighter squatting after that deadlift
session
in the same session and then saturday
is a bench press and upper that saturday
session is
not the heaviest bench of the week it's
probably slightly lighter slightly less
volume
so it's relatively easy to do even if
you're beat up from friday deadlifts but
notice the rest of the week
is very well split up monday wednesday
friday plenty of rest sort of every
other day
and then you get another day of rest
sunday really really cool off and then
get back to work so
four day plan just a sample the rest of
this lecture
and actually all these other videos are
going to have samples of training
programs designed in them
none of this is dogma this is not the
right way to do it it's a right way to
do it but you may choose to go a
different direction
i just want to give you guys a sample so
you can see sort of be grounded in what
this could look like
because like if i just like all the
other talks i've ever given pretty much
are purely theoretical talks where i
teach you guys the principles and sort
of tell you how to apply them
but i never really give examples of like
well this is how it would look like
this is a video in which we give
examples but super important point this
is not dogma this isn't like you have to
do this stuff
it's just a way of doing all right
now we have our sessions in our sample
you could do this many other ways this
is a good one
what about exercise selection exercises
that you pick
for your powerlifting hypertrophy
program have to meet a couple of
different criteria
first they should be growth stimulating
which means they have a high raw
stimulus magnitude
they gotta mess you up because growth
isn't the easiest thing to come by you
have to have exercises that really
disrupt stuff
if you're planning on getting huge quads
from doing a bunch of leg extensions
it's probably not going to work you're
going to have to leg press hack squat
front squat high bar squat real hardcore
gnarly shit is usually the way to go
when growth is important to you
especially when you want to transfer
to the big lifts secondly you want it to
be conducive to heavier loading
we want heavier loading and we'll get to
specifically why in a second
because it builds the kind of muscle and
the kind of nervous system
characteristics innervating that muslim
that transfer the best to actual
strength performance later because if
you build a huge physique
and it turns out that physique kind of
sucks at being as strong as you would
have expected
powerlifting is a weight class sport can
you imagine being like jacked 198
pounder and powerlifting
and then you go and actually lift in
competition people like i thought that
guy would bench way more what the fuck
well if you do all kinds of exercises in
really high repetition ranges
that aren't conducive to heavy training
like if you build your chest and you can
build a big ass chest with like sets of
20
when you start training for strength
your chest is not going to nearly be as
strong as it could be
that transition is going to take longer
it might not take uh it might take so
long it might not be complete by the
time you actually compete and you won't
be as strong as you could be so
sets of 5 to 12 reps are probably best
for building power lifting size
not all exercises are conducive to that
like some exercises are
isolation movements or some exercises
are movements that really only work
super effectively in higher rep ranges
they rely on metabolites so on and so
forth so you want to pick
exercises are conducive to have your
loading and a lot of times compound
having multi-joint basics are the way to
go it's not a dogma thing it's just that
it meets the criteria that we have to
next already alluded to this a bunch has
to have a high transfer to powerlifting
moves
which means if you have a chance to
build your chest for powerlifting
well it's just two exercises just uh
just a thought experiment dumbbell flies
okay or wide grip barbell bench
wide grip of bench is better in that
instance
because it is more similar in every
different way that you can imagine
to the actual competition that you're
going to be doing and it stimulates the
pecs
so the transfer of training is probably
going to be faster simpler
easier or more dependable if your
dumbbell flies go up by whatever number
of pounds
you're kind of like yeah hopefully this
will increase my bench but i don't know
maybe it will maybe it won't if your
wide grip bench goes up by like 30 or 40
pounds
you know that shit is going to transfer
and the transfer is easier
there's no mystery about it it's really
good similar pattern when you start your
strength phase and you switch to
competition grip benching or something
similar if you've been doing wide grip
it's easiest transition in the world one
or two weeks later you're like you're
like a duck in water
if you built your chest with like
dumbbell flies or something and then you
haven't done any benching
and you have to do benching now it's
going to be a weird couple weeks maybe a
weird couple mesocycles a couple months
of training
of transitioning back to benches nothing
you want so you want exercises that have
a good transfer it doesn't mean the
exercises themselves
but ones that are pretty similar in
their movement pattern
next this is kind of a no-brainer but
bears mention
that targets the muscles used in
powerlifting and probably targets the
ones
that you want to bring up right there's
power lifters
that for some reason do like a lot of
vertical lat pulling
and uh a lot of like you know like
flexion based ab work
and a lot of like shoulder work like
side delt work and bicep work and some
power lifters you can train
their calves like you can drain your car
as a power lifter but you have to admit
that's not really making you better at
power lifting
so a lot of the exercises that you pick
should be targeting the muscles
specifically that you want so say
if i want a bigger chest for power
lifting i got to do wide grip work and
it's not an infinite number of variants
here's the thing in bodybuilding a lot
of times
uh in physique sport when we do
hypertrophy for that
you know you can pick a huge variety of
exercises powerlifting narrows that down
because we have very specific needs it's
absolutely important to remember that
if you are powerlifting your training
partner as a bodybuilder there's going
to be some exercises you have to do
differently right
next of course as i mentioned before
high stimulus to fatigue ratio
you don't want an exercise that beats
the shit out of your shoulders
like super ultra wide grip bench let's
say you do that very specific for the
chest which is true
your shoulders get beat up like crazy
you're not getting a chest pump that
sucks
you want to narrow your grip maybe arch
a little bit more all of a sudden your
shoulders feel great your chest is
getting blown up
now we're talking so you still have to
have that subjective judgment of
exercises
this is why a lot of times really really
good coaches they don't write you a plan
of verbatim exercises they'll
communicate with their client to see
okay which exercises work best for you
to stimulate your quads
and you'll say leg extensions i love i
love leg presses hack squats
and high bar close stance squats they'll
be like which one of those is more
specific to power lifting movements
we'll say we're going to use hack squats
and
high bar close down squats boom that's
how you do it a lot of times
if a coach writes an exercise down or
turns out it's not high stimulus to
fatigue ratio for that client
it might not work out so well lastly you
want a little bit of diversity within
the weak
uh a lot of times it's to push one
muscle ahead
while the other one has a little bit so
for example the average routine
for just general hypertrophy for bench
pressing you will have
one of the days focused heavily on chest
thus these are like your wide grip
benches and wide grip
incline bench stuff like that and
another day in which the pushing
exercises are more for the triceps so
maybe instead
of wide grip flat bench and wider grip
incline
you would have close grip uh bench flat
and then you could have like a jm press
and stuff like that that trains the
triceps more
the chest a little less gives the chest
time to breathe until next week when the
chest is hit again
so give that some thought you don't
necessarily want the same exercise over
and over it's also a lot of wear and
tear that happens
it's like a good thing for power lifting
is like high bar narrow stance squats
one day
high bar wide stance squats the next day
or medium stance or front squats so on
and so on and so on you don't
necessarily want to do all the same
stuff you can repeat the same exercises
we tweak
but you don't have to and if you try
repeating them and it's getting really
stale
try some variation it's totally fine as
long as
those variation exercises still meet all
these other criteria
and there's usually more than one
exercise it does so it's not a big
problem
a great place to start because you could
be looking at this and be like what the
fuck i always check this
fucking science shit just start with
your favorite exercises
and then maybe change them maybe alter
them and if they're working great don't
worry about it
maybe you can experiment with movements
you're not used to later when you get a
little bit more comfortable with this
approach to train
all right so exercise selection i'm not
going to read these out feel free to
pause the video at this point and just
see the kind of stuff we came up with
again there's no religion no dogmen here
these are just examples
if you actually run this program
verbatim it'll probably be a pretty
sweet program because it's realistic
these aren't just like
esoteric examples that don't work in
real life but again
you used to say okay we have high bar
squats on monday and then high bar good
mornings
can i replace the high bar good mornings
with stiff-legged deadlifts well you go
back up
uh to slide number seven or number four
on here
and it's uh it says number four exercise
selection do stuff like a deadlift
meet all those criteria uh if the answer
is yes then absolutely yes if they don't
meet
some or all of them then you've got some
choices to make
all right loading range selection really
simple
best transfer of training to strength
when you're using hypertrophy is the 5
to 10 range it's a robust hypertrophy
range and hypertrophy's most muscles
and it's really easy to transfer to
strength so after you finish hypertrophy
phase doing sets of five to ten
you have a great strength based setup
because it's very close to the same
loading range
if you do a hypertrophy phase of sets of
like 15 to 20.
jeez it takes your nervous system weeks
and weeks and weeks your technique weeks
and weeks and weeks to get used to sets
of three to six again
fuck all that so you can do up to sets
of 12 reps
ish remember none of this is hard lines
if you get great results from doing sets
of four for hypertrophy
please by all means have my blessing if
you have no problem transferring
strength
with sets of 15 on some of the
assistance exercises totally cool
just be realistic and start in the
moderate range and only
expand the range or contract the range
if that's what is needed in your
training
through that feedback process so
isolation style moves
you can do up to sets of 12 potentially
more if you need to
especially if you get a better stimulus
fatigue ratios for example if you're
doing lateral raises just for general
shoulder strength and size just a bit
at the end of your program and you're
doing sets of 10 and you're just like my
fucking shoulder joints hurt this is
dumb sets of 10 with laterals fuck that
you try sets of 12 or 6 of 14 or 15 and
it just amazing burn amazing pump
tons of tension in your delts your
joints feel great just do that and the
transfer of training won't be as easy
but it's worth it because the stimulus
to fatigue ratio
is of course as far as putting them
together in your program
almost always especially in powerlifting
application
you want the heaviest stuff first so if
you've got like
three or four exercises you're doing and
some of them are in like
the five to eight rep range some of them
are in the eight to ten rep range
some are in the 10 to 12 and you've got
one at the end that you really like to
do sets of like 12 to 15 with
then it's going to be in that order
heaviest to lightest you don't want to
do it the other way around almost ever
if you guys watch some of my instagram
videos of me lifting i'll do the reverse
order all the time
because i'm a little bitch bodybuilder
now not a powerlifter
don't do that for powerlifting it's not
the best idea absolutely because it
doesn't allow you to produce
the highest levels of tension at the
most productive volumes which is exactly
what you want to do for a
power lifting strength based hypertrophy
plan
so loading range selection just a sample
feel free to pause
take a look at what we did and some of
the illustrations there like the kind of
exercises that you typically load
lighter or heavier
appear as lighter heavier all right
relative effort so how hard are we going
to be training at least in the first
week
people ask this all the time should i be
using rp or rir
especially in powerlifting hypertrophy
because they know that hypertrophy work
a lot of times uses reps in reserve
power lifters often use rpe you really
can just do whichever one
it's totally preference and if you're
not sure try both
right try both no big deal at all
especially if you're doing no more than
10 reps per set
5 to 10 the rp and rar is almost
literally the same thing
if you start doing sets of 12 15
the rpe starts to be more of a guess if
you're comfortable that great
if you want to use rar totally fine the
thing about using rir
is it's awesome for the sets of five to
ten it's probably a little bit better
than rpe
but then you pay the cost of
transitioning modes of autoregulation
when you go into your strength phase so
if you're used to rpe and you get like
because rp takes a while to get used to
if you're used to rp and in your
hypertrophy phases and then your
strength phase starts and you're an rpe
again
fucking sweet if you do reps in reserve
rar for hypertrophy phase
and then you start your strength phase
and it's like oh fuck is because rar
doesn't really work well with strength
if you do rpe and you're like i can rp
what the fuck like you got to relearn
some shit so it's totally fine to just
do rp the whole time but if you want to
do rr totally cool
as far as effort okay where do you want
to start what rp what r well
you want to start every messa cycle add
a relative effort
that gives you easy gains so you don't
have to grind at first there's no reason
because you get easy gains
from just doing minimum rir or rpe
minimum relative effort
you want to build momentum so you don't
want to like try your hardest at the
beginning
gas out with high fatigue and then stop
so you want something nice and easy at
first
and you want a low injury risk your
first your hypertrophy phase you may be
coming off of an active rest phase
you don't want to just get in there and
start going you know rp 9.5 right away
you want to start on the easy side what
does that mean working sets in week one
should be around seven rpe three rar
same thing and then you work off of that
later we'll talk about that in our next
video
how do you know what loads those are
experiment by warming up to them try a
working set
if it's way outside of the rep range
that you planned alter the load
and a lot of times as you train longer
and longer and you know your strength
better
and you have previous hypertrophy phases
off of which to base your loads
it's really easy to pick a load that
takes a real good shot at rp7
or 3rar and then
you know like okay that's roughly
410 to 430 pounds i'm gonna guess 420
and then i do a set i'm like yeah i was
really like
425 would be better because that was
kind of like an rp6 you do sets of 425
and then next week is easy because
it goes from there so so that's really
the answer there
a lot of people ask a ton of questions
and they're really good questions about
like
okay i know what i are a p should i hit
but how do i know what loads do that
there's no replacing knowing your past
training
warming up in that session and trying to
hit your first work set at a reasonable
guess
if the guess is wrong you adjust up or
down depending on how you need to if i
guess it's right you just keep
lifting that same load no big deal so
the only change here is this rir is
filled in as three r for everything
because i wanted the sample program to
be something you guys might be able to
print out on your printer
nobody does anymore screenshot with your
phone and take to the gym and
potentially actually use so
so there it is now what about initial
volume like
okay we have all the details set in
place except like how many sets of shit
are we actually going to do because it's
a pretty good question
well you want to choose working sets in
the first week to do
a couple of things first you want to be
training hard and the way we sort of
quantify that in
powerlifting hypertrophy is like you're
going to be tired at the end of your
session so
if there is no considerable drop in
function and strength in the target
muscle or movement at the end of the
session
you probably just didn't train all that
hard like if you come in and you're
training
quads that day like high bar squats and
stuff and
at the end of the session someone's like
quad's pretty beat up you feel it
the only right answer is at least like
yeah no definitely like my quads took a
hit
if someone's like wow your quads feel
and you're like i'm like
warmed up now it's probably not enough
volume
assuming your relative effort is high
enough maybe you're just cheating on
that
but if you're training hard percent you
should do enough steps to where you're
like yep i feel it
and then stop just just there just the
first
degradation of function but if you can
consistently you know
just do set after set after set and you
feel 100 fine
you probably need more sets right
another proxy which we don't want to
lean too heavily on so it's mostly the
fatigue thing that we detect local
fatigue
but if you're getting a decent pump you
can probably stop
like if you do three sets of wide grip
bench and your pecs are like pretty
pumped it's probably a good idea to stop
because
if you keep going you can run into too
much volume
what does that mean well you don't want
to do this many sets
you don't want to get super sore and
not heal on time for your next session
okay if you do a bunch of pressing and
your chest and triceps get really sore
on monday
and then thursday you have another
pushing session and they're still sore
soreness reduces maximum force
production in many cases
and also because it's literal damage it
increases your chance for injury in that
session that's two things you absolutely
fucking don't want
so make sure you're healing on time so
stop early
the worst thing can happen is a week one
you do not enough sets and you never get
sore then in week two you can go up and
do more sets because you know you're
well within your recovery
guessing on the other end doing too much
fucks up your workouts afterwards and
you have to take
light sessions or recovery sessions or
modify your sessions or just take the
risk face on
that's not great so err on the side of
less and
not just soreness but strength like you
could do lots of sets of deadlifts never
really get so anywhere but you're so
beat up systemically
that the next time you do deadlifts
you're just you just can't recover like
i should have done eight cents a
deadlift last time well maybe stop at
five
and then that won't happen so by the
time you deadlift heavy next you're
super recovered and you're stronger
critical for powerlifting in hypertrophy
training
for pure physique we can make some kind
of at least
decent argument that even if you're not
at your strongest you can still signal a
hypertrophy response but that is a lot
of its own problems with it certainly
it's not sustainable long term but a
couple workouts here and there we don't
hit your biggest numbers not a big deal
you probably still grew
with powerlifting because of a strain
transfer it's so important
like if you're not getting stronger
every workout even in your hypertrophy
phase in that rep range of five to ten
five to twelve
man you're not doing yourself any good
so if you're so tired from doing so much
volume that you're like oh i'm getting
weaker
you're not supposed to get weaker in
your power lifting don't do that okay
it's too much volume
and the bit of wisdom here as i
basically already said
start on the lower end of volume you can
always move up if it's not enough with
really no downsides
but if you do too much they're shit to
fix right
all right so initial volume selection
sample
well what it could look like for a
person getting into hypertrophy training
i'm not going to read these
sets out but like these are pretty
decent to start and if you try to run
this as a program
that you just want to try out totally
cool oh yeah i guess you get a free
program out of this whole deal yahoo
enjoy
so that's it we have if you look at that
last number seven
you have sets exercises rep ranges
relative effort guidelines and sample
loads
so you can see what that could
realistically look like for someone of
like this
uh example strength you're on to
something you can do the first week of
training like this
now the next video is gonna cover on
what you do on progression yeah first
weeks are nice
but what about week two three four five
et cetera how do we do that
see you next time for the next video
