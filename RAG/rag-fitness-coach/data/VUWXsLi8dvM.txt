lastly
all of the points I gave are nothing
without consistency
some weeks you do some of these okay
other weeks you're really kind of bad
you're not going to gain the maximum
amount of muscle
consistency is King applying these
techniques that I just taught you
consistency day in day out sure you'll
have some bad days some good days keep
it up
week in week out month in month out
three or four months of this sort of
program that I'm describing you will get
much bigger
you'll get as big about as you can
because this is really leveraging
everything we know that for sure gains
size all in the same apparatus
if you'd like help in the description we
have a download for the RP hypertrophy
app it will organize your training
exactly like this
