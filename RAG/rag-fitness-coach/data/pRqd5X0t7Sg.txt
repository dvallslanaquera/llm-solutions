[Applause]
two things one i'm gonna go to the house
and get some
serious mass i'm almost passed out and i
set
two i'm so hypo i forgot
what was an algae i was gonna make about
delts
and pumps
just look at jared's body
fewer girl how would you resist
i look at charlie's dumb animal body
all right i'll be back
youtube
two requests
for you guys this time you get to be
involved
one
can you just like
not
two
um can you just like stop
thank you
now here's the workout
jared and charlie are here they're part
of team full rom
and so what
so what we're going to do is we're going
to do
a free motion cable based shoulder and
bicep work out
that's seven
syllables ish
words
syllables it's all just noise huh am i
right fellas
that was way more than seven syllables
is dr mike high and drunk lol one of
those like 50 if you comment that i
promise you i will personally comment
can you just like not on your fucking
post
wait for it i'll do it for you
but
before that these guys did push with me
earlier i did my triceps they
wanted a split chest and triceps up so
now they're gonna do triceps first then
shoulders and biceps i'm gonna do caves
first case
and then shoulders and biceps clearly
jared doesn't need any more calf work
and charlie's caps kind of suck
i'm just kidding charlie i knew it was
gonna be painful to hear that
i did it just to hurt you folks let's
get the workout going
what up boob tube
me and charlie are starting with triceps
it's a similar exercise
the mic actually did in the am but we
just did more chest volume so
there's a little bit much for me to do
in one session splitting up
triceps and my other pushing volume
because it's hard to get through the
entire pushing volume that i do for my
chest and front belts
in one session if i add my triceps in so
my rep pushdown
you guys have seen my reps before
three sets
matching the first set
i'm not proud of you at all man
go home
take the tea off take the ball off the
tee take the ball off the tee take it
home
i'm practicing for being a dad i'm like
seeing a dad dad
feels a little better
what are you what do you want
that's fine okay
yeah yeah bruh
that was a good switch
thing
was it too light for you
oh
[Laughter]
watch your head
are you too big to fight your elbows
back huh are you too big for what
put your elbows back
i'll try it there's the first because
they would yeah i'll try it again if
you're too big that's what i was asking
i'm smaller so
[Music]
i'm just a little like this
yeah
[Music]
yeah all the way up kind of like a jm it
stretches your tricep a little more
[Music]

[Applause]
fighting back and then
[Music]
backing in backing in

you know what to do
in his life
mechanically okay physics says
the tricep is best activated with this
palm
grip not this not wrapped around the
finger
did you tie me to my eye they reduce the
transverse abduction
relax your wrist jared god you're so
stupid like this
hey guys i'm hypoglycemic
i'm just thinking like do you ever want
to be a bird
instead of a human
oh jared's demoing our first exercise
which isn't really our first you tell
them a hypo
dr mike how did you get hypoglycemic is
it peptides is it growth hormone is it
insulin dr mike tell us your protocol dr
mike
dr mike
well there he is good technique as far
as i can tell
already warmed up
should be our first working set and goal
is 21 reps
why 21 dr mike because last week i did
20.

jerry separate your arms you can fix
that
sure you know that there we go
my man i i thought you would
get pissed off by him i don't like the
little that's all i like i can never
tell
i'll i'll give this rant afterwards
this is a good one
i got two
let's go jared
fuck yeah come on
so if like a machine is clanking weird
and jared's using it i litters a 50
chance
that he hates the clinking and he's like
fuck mike your machine is dumb versus
like i don't care for clint the fuck's
wrong with you why would you care
anyone's guess you on youtube you think
you have the inside edge charlie and i
know jared for years we have no idea
which one it's going to be i think
youtube's just going to agree with me
like we fucking hate mike too at this
point so i get it
well i guess so like it's just about
hating mike and not about any of the
technical qualities of the machine
i'm not just like don't provide feedback
i've thought about everything you're
gonna say except more
more
do you like the clanking it just does i
want my arms closer so my shoulder hurts
out here all right folks
got shoulders done nice and pumped
and
cable bicep time
this is my like
last week of accumulation
it's these guys like what is it
first and second week so a bit of a
different intensity here
but uh let me do in my rep match that's
so it's i don't know what the weight
stack is 15 kilos or something it's got
some 15 next to 10.5
