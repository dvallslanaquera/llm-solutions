i don't care
[Music]
i'm mike
this is jared
this is desean williams he is a
bodybuilder a gentleman an entrepreneur
and a leader of a few nations in this
world as a matter of fact he's here on
diplomatic assignment and by accident
they dropped him off at the gym and they
said you gotta train back delts and buys
with the rp strength crew
oops
but he's ready
yeah you ready you know just like black
panther you know what i'm saying yeah
honda forever we in the building oh
we're in the building hey and this is
game time man you know this this might
be a little different than your usual
workout i don't know if you're really
used to this type of energy but we here
we're 100 energy
see you in the next workout see you in
the next one
oh yeah what an intro
[Music]
folks
when you really want something
you do the work and you say your prayers
at night
if you want big lats you actually
combine that into the lat prayer which
we're going to be doing
front pull down is also a thing or
straight arm pull down is also a thing
but essentially we're trying to get the
maximum stretch on our lats at the top
and then a nice peak contraction at the
bottom you can either have your arms
completely locked out or slightly bent
whichever way you can feel your laugh
the most now a lot of folks say they
feel the long head of their triceps on
this that's sweet you get a bigger long
head of the triceps it is actually
involved play with width right here
play with whether or not you are locking
out completely or just slightly i would
recommend a thumbs over grip and then
see which one hits your lats the most
and the triceps to the amount that you
want them to be hit remember if your
triceps get blown up your lats still get
blown up as well nine times out of ten
let's get this done multiple sets of oh
10 to 15 10 to 20 reps voila
one and slow
all these quality big chest
two slow
three keep going fuck it
slow stretch pull stretch
that's it that's it that's it that's it
good stuff and rack rack rack
only good technique good stuff good
stuff
we don't want you to stand up here
because it'll it'll top out on you
so sag down this way so that you get a
big stretch up here and then when you're
coming through feel free to stand but
then when you're coming back down lean
back into it and let it pull you open
and then back like this does that make
sense whenever you're ready oh shit oh
shit backwards
it just happened you know
you know that's phase one of it really
getting started
you know we got a little bit of blood
flowing but nothing crazy sure it comes
off that's like stage three
you feel me
good slow on the way back up
chest down
stretch full stretch and down yes
beautiful
chest down
dude these are good fucking wraps slow
[Music]
stretch
and back good
slow
control chest forward
amazing
go
good keep those arms straight
full stretch there it is
[Music]
good three more slow
control no body language
[Music]
perfect slow
that's it good stuff way to call it way
too cold
solid on to the next
i like can i tell you something kind of
weird absolutely every
lifting implement that i have i want to
look as much like a dildo as possible
just like holding onto dicks you know
what i'm saying but i'm not gay
but i just like just like holding dicks
i won't judge you bro you know what i'm
saying like it's just like
it's a thing people some people just
have yeah and to me all the dicks in the
world
as a straight man
[Music]
lat prayers have pre-exhausted deshawn's
lats which is really good now we're
gonna focus again on lats with a
vertical pulley movement the assisted
pull-up
what's the difference between a
pull-down and assisted pull-up it really
comes down to like a little bit of force
dynamics type of stuff you can control
the eccentric better on assisted
pull-ups you can get a better peak
contraction uh not as many grips
available and i feel like personally for
me and a lot of other people stimulus to
fatigue ratio on a system pull-ups just
really damn good it's just a good
exercise now the real question is why
not regular pull-ups and the answer is
simple assistant pull-ups just reduce
the loading right so we can do more reps
that's it
because in some rep ranges muscles tend
to have higher stimulus to fatigue
ratios than others the lats generally in
most of the back
seems to respond a little bit better to
sets of 10 to 20 then sets of 5 to 10. i
think is with good actual technique so
few people can do sets of 10 to 20 with
pull-ups that we really do rely on the
system bullet machine a lot that's why i
do them that's why you do them that's
why grandma does them so desean just
snuck up on me like that everybody does
everybody except you at home are doing
the shit why
big backs out here 100
what are you doing with your life what
are you doing

good enough
[Music]
good stuff very good
so i don't know what we doing guys all i
know is i did my three pull-ups all
right my three sets
what do you what did you do today
lap prayers done lats isolated
vertical pulling with assistive pull-ups
done
we're really well on our way we're going
to finish
with a rolling movement something we
haven't done on the channel i don't
think too much maybe ever cable rows
they're a fine tool and toolbox but the
technique has to be right if you heave
hoe it you might as well do something
like bent rows to produce super super
high forces it's not for high forces
it's for a real solid amount of
technique and what we're trying to do
is engage not just the lats because
they're already pretty fried
remember rowing is for a bunch of other
stuff than just lats
you want your lower back to stay
relatively stable you're going to round
over your upper back your shoulder
blades are going to scoot forward and
then guess what all the muscles that do
this
are in your fucking back and if you go
like here
touch the tummy for just a split second
and then return back is a huge stimulus
to all of the muscles of the upper back
middle back and lower back including
your entire spinal erector complex we're
going to do a few sets 10 to 20 reps
good feel free to lean back a little bit
at the top
more exaggerated
there it is yes
perfect that's a good hold more more to
sean let's go
pull
and then down
lean back a little at the top punch that
back together
it's like you're
cocking up for a rear double body let's
go
good big stretch
and pull a big stretch
and pull
up up all the way up you get one chance
good keep going the set continues big
chest
yes slow
big chest
three more and you're done
and one last one
and last one
go
yes wrap
man you know
you see we put in a little bit of work
with our youtube ways here
we don't use real weights
all these other athletes do
but i just told them
make sure i look good
it doesn't he and doesn't he look good
big stretch yep and then come up good
touch every timer doesn't count
good
good
awesome good
no body language back only
yep
yep
one after another high reps
bullshit full stretch
last set of the day for back best side
of the day for back
big chest
good five more
[Music]
[Music]
last one
i tell ya hell yeah
beautiful
easy money man
money's too fucking easy to make out you
know and i'm tired of making this shit
yeah you see you see this is what
happens when you just sit and observe
you know you sit on the side and you
look like a deflated bag of chips
all right
the family size that's nasty sized
we got mr olympia's walking around he's
left me
went to the coal side i don't know about
him
we didn't believe that was a
misunderstanding it was not a
misunderstanding walking around watching
them can i ask you a question yes how
many miss olympia titles do you have i
have on the books 11 10 i can only count
i count 11.
right here we count 11.
delts
superset machine
it's kind of neat here same machine
rear delt flies and then as soon as
those get real tired
center and then do regular delt flies
which also attacks the rear adults as
well as the sides a few sets here five
to ten reps on the rear delts because
it's pretty tough and then 10 to 15 on
the side belts
here's the thing about delt training
on the rear delts you can get away with
some stuff because the back training
gets them so big anyway on side delts if
you want big side delts
controlling the eccentric is huge so you
can do kind of what you need to do to
get them up no bullshit on the way down
if you fucking milk them out under
control you will see better games let's
get it done not gonna come with those
little strokes
let's go back
good all the way down
at the bottom lean in a little bit to
get them under your legs and then come
up
good i'm going to leave it open-ended
for you to sean you do as many as you
think you want to bro
good technique
don't swing one more don't swing use the
belt

because he's full of wisdom even though
his biceps
[Music]
four sets
