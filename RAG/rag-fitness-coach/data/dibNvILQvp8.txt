and of course i had to celebrate
why would i do anything but get me a new
car
that cost maybe around 250k dollars oh
you want to see it you say well let's
have ourselves a look
where is my lambo
clearly
this lawnmower state of the art in 1992.
here's the truth folks
my wife and i
did some thinking
we just moved to the fine state of
michigan and we thought hey
it's time for me to have my own car then
we realized we really only go to the
grocery store
and i don't have any friends we don't go
anywhere else
i'm using my wife's car when she's not
using it
i don't know how i feel about that
should i get a lambo or should i get a
lotus
exige i don't even know cars folks
comment like subscribe whatever other
youtube maybe next time we'll
actually have a real car peace
