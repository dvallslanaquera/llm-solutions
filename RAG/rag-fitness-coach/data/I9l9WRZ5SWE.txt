hey folks it's me Dr Mike and welcome to
the targeting the muscle series our
Target
is hamstrings and we're going to be
doing good mornings how do you use the
good morning exercise to help checklist
just a few little quick things to be
able to Target the hamstrings better we
have a bunch of tips let's get to tip
number one ASAP
tip number one is we want to anteriorly
tilt our pelvis so if the hamstrings are
pre-stretched and then when you're doing
the good morning exercise you have to go
the least amount down using the least
amount of physical work getting least
amount of fatigue but still hitting
hamstrings a lot the number one place
where that comes from is from the hips
and lower back I want you to Arch your
lower back so you're going to be doing
this having sex backwards movement
notice my lower back is going to be nice
and harsh and tight and then when I
start to sit in from my good morning
I've already pre-stressed my hamstrings
a ton if you posteriorly pelvically tilt
and Bear Down you start to go down
you're going to be going down a long
time until you feel anything in your
hamstrings because they're not
pre-stressed so tip number one push your
butt back arch your lower back and then
start to descend vacuum down
tip number two so if you arch your back
appropriately and then you're scooting
your butt back as you bend over you're
going to notice that your knees are
going to want to go forward because the
hamstrings are going to be pulling on
them and that is going to end up
curling those knees for you we don't
want to do that we want to pull the
hamstrings apart at the hip and at the
knee
tons of eccentric tension leads to tons
of hypertrophy so what we want to do is
as we Arch back and push our butt back
and we hinge Bend at the hips we want to
make sure that we're not completely
straight need like this
something just outside of that bend and
instead of letting the knees Bend as you
keep going you want the knees to stay
just a bit back as you go down with the
knees back back arch knees back back
arched
wow I'm hurting already in the hams and
that's a really good sign
[Music]
for some folks arching the lower back
and pushing the knees back is going to
be everything they need and they're
going to get an awesome stimulus to
fatigue ratio great hit for the
hamstrings but for other folks myself
included as I get deeper I start to not
know if my back is rounding or not
a huge safety concern with most loads
but definitely a concern that if your
back is rounding the lower back
musculars are starting lower back
musculature is starting to be the
primary muscle hit and no longer the
hamstrings so a cue that helps me
especially at the bottom is as I'm doing
my good morning down I think chest up if
I push my chest up the entire time chest
up and out and I think knees back my
back automatically arches for me and
everything goes great chest up chest up
just up holy fuck that hurts already and
then I gently come up it works
[Music]
all right next big tip
with a bunch of exercises if you go
pretty quick on The Eccentric nothing
much happens you still get a great
stimulus the good morning is not one of
them in good mornings you want to make
sure that the tension is all in the
hands and if you go down quickly first
of all not exactly ideal for hamstring
injury risk because if you go down fast
with good mornings you're increasing
The Leverage pushed into the hamstrings
on the way down they get more and more
painfully stretched the further you go
that's bad news to try to hit really
fast you don't want to dive on this
exercise and if you go too fast you can
lose connection with what else is going
on so the best thing to do for
hamstrings is a more than usual
exaggerated slow eccentric I like to
take three or four seconds and then do
my shit now Han Center can be totally
fast no problem eccentric should be slow
next big tip as you start the exercise
in your Jew and repetitions you may be
able to get a great mind muscle
connection your hamstrings are firing
everything's awesome
what you may run into as a problem is as
you fatigue
your mind muscle connection didn't
decrease and it can become just a matter
of you going up and down any old way and
just doing the movement
so here's the big tip as you get more
fatigued as you get closer to failure
super cue yourself slow it down even
more
as you're getting close to failure just
open these back knees back knees back
back arms chest up oh there we go slow
and meticulous and steady that's more
important to do
closer to when you're failing
versus in the first few reps so a lot of
people have really great technique first
couple reps as they get tired they break
down so what I do to combat this is as I
know I'm getting tired I'll remind
myself of the technique cues hips back
knees barely bent knees straighter knees
straighter chest up and then every rep
towards failure is awesome mission
accomplished
[Music]
last question and last tip how deep to
go on good mornings is deeper better no
what's better is getting deep enough
so that you're generating a ton of
tension still with the hamstrings a lot
of eccentric pain in the hamstrings
but you're still strong and you're
positioning in your lower back and your
knees has not been compromised so watch
this
if I go now this is unloaded I could go
a little deeper with weight by the way
this is a Transformer bar for Mr
Kristoff and it's fucking awesome
and I think it's a jet pack too I could
fly away with but this works all those
tips work for any other bar
if
I go with really good technique unloaded
knees back right here is where I feel an
incredible amount of pain in my hands my
back is still arched chest still up
knees still back this is the bottom of
my death I can't really go any further
if I wanted to go further I would have
to do one of three things round my chest
round my back lose that tension
or
curve my knees over and bend my knees
now look at this holy shit watch this
wow best rum ever bullshit because
that's not hamstring wrong so
how you pick your best depth is Arch
into your technique super well and when
your knees are back and when your chest
is up when you're experiencing a ton of
pain and stretching the hands
that's when it's time to go back up what
you can do
is set the support in a place you know
that's roughly going to happen after a
bunch of sessions and then gently
touching the supports tells you you did
a good rep but before you do that
explore get your Technique right do your
best
and then it's all massive hamstrings
Seas of massive hamstrings
from there on out guys thank you for
tuning in see you next time
