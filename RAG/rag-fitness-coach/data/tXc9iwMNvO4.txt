hey folks
doctor mike is here for renaissance
periodization
strength training made simple video
number 14 preventing and managing
injuries uh preventing good managing
stinks but you got to do it sometimes
because injuries will happen despite
your best efforts but
what do we mean by vast efforts how do
you stay safer than you could otherwise
be
when pursuing strength training we have
four good tips for you first
don't be an idiot now don't worry we're
not just lambasting you for something
we have specific ways to not be an idiot
first warm
up do not rush warm-ups do not rush
warm-ups
do not rush warm-ups under any
circumstance that is 90
something percent of why people get hurt
as far as my own personal experience
people rush warm-ups don't do it if
you're training for hypertrophies that's
a 20 to 30
your first set is a warm-up it's fine
it's a power lifter weight lifter strong
strongman
rushing warms just type into google i
rush my warm-up
and you get all kinds of stories don't
do it take your time there's not enough
time for you in the session
to get a good warm-up and train you got
to reschedule that session that's as
simple as i'm going to keep it
also keep your technique clean never
sacrifice good technique
you do it once nothing happens you feel
emboldened you do it twice nothing
happens you feel great
you do it fourth fifth sixth time time
number seven
some of your shit snaps up and then
you're like god damn it why the hell did
i do that don't
be in that 20 20 hindsight position just
keep your technique super clean
which means keep it similar week to week
to week stable technique is a safe
technique
don't do crazy let's try it shit with
higher loads for example
let's say you've been squatting with a
pretty close stance for weeks and weeks
and months and months
you've warmed up to a super heavy load
you've done one working set let's say
and your friend's like hey you ever
tried like a wide stance squat you're
like oh let me try that do not and try
it
don't do it with the same way that
you've been used to narrow stance
don't ever remotely think about it
here's how you would do it
finish your closed stance squatting take
a ton of weight off the bar go down to
like
half of what you normally squat and try
a wide stance squat and if it feels good
next week do the same thing heavy work
still on your normal closed dent squats
and then know 10 or 15 or 20 pounds more
on that wide stance squat
afterwards and then after a few weeks
your wives down squat's going to start
to come up pretty high
and then the next mesocycle you can
switch to just widest down squatting as
a fresh exercise do not just get into
new technique under heavy loads
great way to get hurt because your
tissues are not specifically adapted
to the force vectors of that exact lift
and if it's a very different technique
they're
very different you may have the muscle
strength to lift the weight
but not the connective tissue integrity
to support the weight during various
phases
and then chances of snap city absolutely
increase
another big one on this note of don't be
an idiot keeping technique clean
especially with the heaviest loads
there's tons of people like yeah my
technique good until you get beyond 90
or the last rep is always bad it should
be the other way around chad wesley
smith
of juggernaut training he just great
youtube channel by the way juggernaut
training systems
has tons and tons of ideas about how
your technique if you're a really good
lifter
needs to improve the heavier you go
because you're relying on that technique
to be safer and heavier loads and to be
more productive as far as maximal uh
force is concerned
so your technique when somebody watches
you do a max deadlift
and that you put the bar down you turn
to them you're like we think they're
like yeah technique is kind of stinky
and you're like yeah but it was a max
no no no no that is a route to snap city
you're a real good lifter
like up here as well as here you're
going to make sure that every lift looks
amazing
look to the russians i know a
self-serving statement eastern european
lifters
their warm-ups look exactly like their
1rms
that is the model you want to practice
not like once the weight gets heavy
bucket or whatever
that's a good way to get hurt number two
general concept you want to ramp up your
volumes and loads
slowly you never want to add more than a
set per session
per week if you're adding sets if you
start with three sets of bench next week
don't do six sets of bench do maybe four
if you have to and often times you just
increase load
the load addition should not increase by
more than
one rpe point a load that takes you from
an rp7
to an rp8 next week is totally fine even
if it's just seven to seven and you
still added load that's amazing you do
not want to do an rp7 load one week
and then next week slap 45s on the bar
and do an rp10
great way to get hurt so loads should be
slowly incremented
not radically altered week to week to
week and
on the soreness front don't train with
overlapping soreness
often in hypertrophy training it's bad
mechanistically to train with
overlapping soreness because the
damage literally interferes with growth
but like you're probably not going to
get hurt because you know who gets hurt
doing sets of 20 or
15 or whatever as a strength trainees
that's a three to six
soreness is literal microfiber damage
okay you're you're taking a rubber band
and kind of like breaking it at the
edges a bit
and then saying let's really apply a ton
of force don't
do that if you're still sore like really
sore take a technique session
come back next time reduce the volume a
little bit then you won't be sore and
then you can build
up to really good consistent frequency
of overload versus training sore all the
time and getting yourself into some
trouble
point number three pay attention if a
technique hurts you
and that pain is increasing with every
rep and with every set in every week
change something because if you just
just oh yeah deadlifts hurt my back but
whatever
six months later you're like oh it turns
out i have permanent damage in my back
like that sucks i didn't know how it
happened well
if you're paying attention we're not
telling you to be a wuss but lifting
shouldn't hurt your joints over and over
and over and get worse and worse and
worse yeah every now and again things
will feel weird you're like oh whatever
you do another warm up you feel fine
that's totally cool but if things are
getting progressively worse try to
change your grip
angle something take a de-load something
has to give because if you consistently
have
joint connective tissue pain that gets
worse you're literally asking for injury
you're
begging for the shit at that point
number four i know it's tough d
load like you're supposed to take after
active rest like you're supposed to
take recovery sessions like you're
supposed to a lot of people want to skip
the deload a lot of people want to cut
the deal
short you start feeling pretty good
about 60 of the way through your d-load
you start feeling damn good so like
thursday friday you're like fuck it
let's start training again
your muscles feel great your systemic
fatigue is now low but remember
connective tissues take
longer to heal than everything else
which means and by the way they're very
poorly innervated your tendons have very
few nerves in them
so you can't even tell if they're afraid
you're tending in a fucking string
you have no idea about it because your
muscles heal you feel fine and
systemically you feel great
get in there and boom some shit snaps
it's unlikely but it's possible
nice long full-length deals and active
rest phases
don't add work during your dealer
because you're feeling itchy you're like
oh do some more reps get a pump don't do
that
deal is r4 easy as a mature person as a
mature lifter
easy is good because it gives you that
ability to heal
everything have another productive cycle
so don't rush it
don't cut it short because you need to
heal that'll keep you much safer from
injury now
shit doesn't always happen that way and
i'll tell you this right now big
statement on life in general
all of the training process no matter
how perfect you are you will still get
hurt on occasion it just happens you're
training hard and heavy
shit absolutely happens when it happens
you can be prepared to do the right
thing so first of all for all the other
stuff that didn't get hurt let's say you
hurt your quad
when you're saying okay can i still
train bench and can i still train some
posterior chain
the answer to that is yes if the
benching adversary chain or whatever
else you want to train isn't hurting the
injured area
at all or hardly at all if it's like
yeah i tried to deadlift but my quad
really hurts
stop deadlifting let your quad heal and
then you can get back to it later
but for that injured area specifically
just kind of like a seven step process
of getting back to 100 normal training i
know it's seven steps it sucks
but you can either do this and pretty
nearly guarantee that you're back to 100
or close or you cannot do this and skip
a bunch of steps and rush through it
and just keep getting hurt and hurt and
hurt and hurt which one you want it
depends on how impatient you are and how
short-sighted you are you're probably
neither of those things
so you're gonna do this right so here's
the deal number one when you get hurt
if it's a bad injury see a medical
professional and do all the surgery
rehab
time away any combination that they
instruct so that you're cleared to go
back to physical activity by them having
done everything right
so people get out of surgery and they're
like yep yeah i go do rehab you're like
yeah
fuck that i'm gonna do my own rehab and
then they're maxing the bench a week
later
stupid idea don't do that so when you're
cleared for activity by your rehab
person or the surgeon or whoever
or just the regular med docs that take
two weeks off and you get back into it
you want to start with sets of 20 to 30
reps
at 5 to 10 reps in reserve that is a
very easy set
and just work on range of motion once
you have a pain-free range of motion
with those lighter sets you can work up
to
hard sets of 20 to 30. so zero to three
reps in reserve okay
very very pushing it very very hard once
you feel good and there's no pain and
everything feels fine training hard
you can start to add in a few sets to
cycle from minimum effective volume to
maximum recoverable really start
building some muscle in the 23rd
representation the forces are really low
and that's on purpose
okay the weights are really light so
that the forces are low so that we don't
expose the connective tissues to high
forces because they're still healing
while we build muscle which is really
really cool number four
okay so we've done we've added some sets
so we're training pretty hard
over time with number five we're going
to slowly add some load in until we're
lifting in the 10 to 20 rep range okay
you do not just one week do sets of 30
and the next week do sets of 10.
you just add 5 or 10 pounds here and
there to slowly lower it while raising
the forces
awesome and if you survive that no big
deal then you're ready
to continue adding load if everything is
good with sets of 10 and 12
then you start dipping into the 5 to 10
range there's d-loads in between this
potentially it might be a long process
we'll get to that in a sec
once you're feeling really great in the
five to ten range for at least some
amount of time
then you can start dipping in to sets of
three to six and once the three to sixes
feel good
you're good because if you can lift
heavy with sets of three to six by the
way you put on a ton of muscle during
this time
then you're good to go and there's
clearly the injury is not a concern
anymore right
now how long does this take
this can take if it's a teeny tiny
little tiny little pull
this whole process can take a week okay
like monday
you do one and two wednesday you do
three and four
and then friday you do five and six and
then next week you do seven which just
sets a three to six and you feel great
that absolutely can happen that's a
little ding it's not really an injury
if it's a full quad evolution okay you
just tore your quad out from under you
during the actual competition this whole
thing can take
months it can take a year and a half
because
there's checklists here like once you
are doing this and successfully doing it
without pain or weirdness then you move
on
it's an auto regulated process so when
should you stop doing sets of 20 to 35
to 10 ir
and start to do sets of 20 to 30 a 3r
when do you move from step 2 to step 3.
the answer is when you are pain-free
with through that range of motion that's
it that's your answer and it may happen
after one session
and it may happen after six months
you're not in charge of that
your body's in charge of that listen to
your body well do what's right
be patient you'll have build some muscle
after this and eventually be
stronger than when you got hurt with
damn near no memory of the injury at all
that's the ideal
do your best see you next time
