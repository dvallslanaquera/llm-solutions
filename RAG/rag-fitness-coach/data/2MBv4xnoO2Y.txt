anything after 20 sets per session
especially at a high level especially if
they're struggling to bring up a muscle
group or their whole body is just so
much that it tips over that rough area
of what we call for sure junk volume and
there are better ways to train so what
are the better ways well if you ever hit
this point where in a workout
consistently over a few weeks I do
anytime I do over eight sets of quads
the last two sets three sets or four
sets but just nonsense okay I'm not even
lifting a lot of weight I'm so tired I
have no idea what fuck
technique blows neural drive sucks mind
muscle I don't even know where my quads
are if that's the case you can add more
sessions do not try to cram in more and
more sets to one session
