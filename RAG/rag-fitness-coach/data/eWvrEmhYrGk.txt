youtube gold
[Music]
hey youtube best jared feather i'm dr
mike and this is joe sullivan he made a
terrible mistake again to come train
with us but this time it's for a purpose
joe hit it why are we here uh so
basically i was telling these guys jared
already knows because he trains out here
and he trains with brianni uh
consistently but i am me and my coach
jake benson we're both training uh at
the same time to go for tom flatts
legendary video in which he squatted 525
pounds for 23 reps we're ramping up to
an open house at dragon's lair where
we're both going to attempt to do the
same thing and try to push that number
into the 25 to 30 range so i've already
been doing a lot of high repetition
stuff a lot of low rest time stuff a lot
of aerobic capacity stuff so i feel like
this time i'm more prepared
for the shit that we're gonna do but the
problem with being prepared as an elite
athlete is that that's basically just
putting me in a better position to uh
do more damage to myself so
i might get rhabdo today but it's gonna
be fun and i'll just go eat in and out i
don't know so let's yeah yeah that
sounds like a plan and that's planned
enough for us
so here's the plan for today stiff
legged deadlifts then high rep leg
presses then some cambered bar squats
with an extra heel wedge for extra
upright extra quads
gonna be a tough workout for mr joe here
starting off with stiff legged deadlifts
we are doing stiff leg deadlifts weight
lifting slash bodybuilding style
some people call them rdls
same exercise so the big cues here are
to keep a completely arched entire back
none of this crap
all this
knees are almost straight not here but
just here
and then you push your butt back and
keep your knees straight to get a ton of
painful tension in the hamstrings when
your lower back starts to round you run
out of active range of motion in your
hamstrings you come back up
that's it that's the whole exercise sets
of five to ten reps
pain
big chest big chest big chest slow
up
again big chest and knees back
almost straight knees yeah fuck yeah
yeah that's a good cue i don't like that
one more almost straight chest up chest
up chest up and that's it
and down
[Music]
that's i like that knees back here that
sucks
as you go slow push your knees back
further and your chest up more yeah you
know it's right when your hamstrings are
peeling apart no and that's that cue
that jared just gave me where it was
like touch the top of the glutes to the
top of the wall behind you that was that
was that feeling
into the dragon yeah yeah good yeah
because the dragon's like that's usually
a saturday night but he's just hung out
yeah yeah
he's not gonna play really hard he's
like hey joe
that was gonna feel really nice
get those real tight you're gonna need
them
[Music]
slow
knees back butt back
[Music]
butt back
yes
beautiful one
fuck back tummy chest
yes knees back
that was perfect except for the knees
knees knees chest
oh yeah you feel that in the hands yep
chest chest chest knees
yeah there you go good
[Music]
the chest
knees knees knees
good more
chest up
knees back knees back slow
up whoop losing balance
going back and just fucking yeah i am
sure yeah you feel that your hands okay
yeah yeah i'm i saw you doing the
more out yeah i got that
that was great yeah have a seat or
something relaxed
nice and slow
knees
yes right there joe
that was a very good rep stay plenty
just like that
[Music]
chest
yep
tummy out
knees
yes
good again
big chest big chest open
[Music]
up one more joke
up
yeah losing the straps sorry
felt the good stimulus there yeah very
good yeah
it's
it's a huge stretch
compared to what yeah compared to like
what i'm normally feeling like in the
deadlift doesn't power
big chest big tummy slow watch the
erectors butt hole up
and chest knees
and chest beautiful
keep that back straight joe
there it is just like that
knees yes
[Music]
great knee position joe
perfect that was a great fucking rep one
more
reset reset reset reset
let's get a couple reps here start this
one from the ground okay
big big arch
let's get two more good reps one from
the ground
get your arch going big arch arch arch
arch and then pick up the yes good again
that's it keep losing the fucking straps
i'm sorry that's okay
[Music]
you just just
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
that shit sucks
i
the one correction where you like ass up
and i go like this and i'm like oh my
god
like fuck
it makes them very hard what it makes
you really hard yeah
leg press
if you guys have seen the channel before
you know the drill
my rep style g probably
four to six sets here joe's in really
good shape he's been doing a lot of
volume
but there's volume and then there's
volume
always a full range of motion always
making sure to push through the whole
foot not getting up on your toes not too
much just on the heel
knees come out as the person goes down
lots of fun here
sets of
10 to 20 reps hopefully starting with
like sets of
g probably 15 to 25 because again joe is
training
for squatting
505 pounds back in 25 which is nonsense
idea to begin with but he's probably the
guy to do it and we're going to help by
making sure training here is specific
this is going to be a lot of fucking
pain
oh hey what's up i heard it
yeah we're uh we're actually long-lost
brothers we're both from michigan uh
both from shitty parts of michigan huh
so
yep
that's hurt it's cool
do you feel your feet twisting right
from the start no they want to be out
like this
just like that okay yeah
it'll help you get lower too yeah okay
so the more you put your toes out and
the more you open your hips a little bit
right right right the same as the squat
i'm just like it's probably just like me
as a power lifter trying to keep this so
it creates more torque yeah yes we don't
want that not here
two my rep rest breaks per set gross so
you can do as many as you can and you
call it yourself we'll try to help when
you get tired lock out take nice deep
breaths three to five breaths and then
again yep and then again and then that's
it yep okay cool let's start with at
least ten on the first one okay
everything is good technique the reps
are 50 times less important than the
technique
hips forward butt down there you go
if you ever need to reset reset yep
slow
oh beautiful one
nine
rest breathe
good breaths
whenever you're ready another three to
four

so if you guys go watch
the power lifters try bodybuilding
workout with chris duffin and joe
joe was in powerlifting shape back then
now he's in power lifting volume and
hypertrophy
today and he did 50 times better he did
way more volume of work he handled it
way better he still threw up but that's
a shit happens that's that's training
he's still sitting up which is nice
because he was laying down after this
last time hey just turns out when you
train you get better shape and your
quads are like double the size they used
to be so you're 250 and wayne 250 and
lean it's all right god damn
alrighty folks that's all we got jared
any wise words of wisdom from bronchitis
