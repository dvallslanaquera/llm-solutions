hey folks dr mike here for renaissance
periodization today's big question is
how do we successfully do more pull-ups
but it's more particular than that it is
how do we train to be able to do more
pull-ups if we care about that sort of
thing
if the conventional stuff just hasn't
worked for us or hasn't worked very well
there's kind of oh
three different sorts of problems you
could be facing in your quest to do more
pull-ups the first is
you wanna you know
you do some roughly like five pull-ups
right now
and good technique all the way full
range of motion everything but you
really kind of want to work up to closer
to 10.
why 10
you know it's kind of sort of a random
number but a lot of people seem to think
that if you can do more than 10 pull-ups
like you're officially like
you're doing really well for yourself
vertical pulling strength wise and uh
you know outside of really tiny people
uh that's probably true right and then
it's a big difference five and ten uh it
seems like oh just add a rep every week
but if you're really struggling that
might not work
next thing is
um
you know you maybe are doing around five
pull-ups or something like that
um or maybe you're doing around 15
pull-ups or something like that
but you haven't added a rep to your
pull-ups in like a year
right so all the conventional stuff
which i'll just go through in a second
you've already tried it didn't work and
you're really fundamentally stuck and
you need a little bit of a new way to
look at how to
very seriously approach the ability to
do more pull-ups and then lastly you may
be in the situation where you
actually can't do a pull-up yet
and you want to do your first pull-up
and in this case
the program design and principles i'm
going to sort of elucidate for you here
they work really well for you especially
for you so give this a good look now
earlier i said this is a special video
because regular training just hasn't
worked in a while to meaningfully
increase your ability to do pull-ups so
what do i mean by sort of conventional
training conventional practices by this
i mean stuff a lot of you have probably
tried and stuff that i've tried in the
past
stuff that's pretty popular
for example just training hard okay and
if you ask someone in like reddit
comments or youtube comments hey how do
i any tips for doing more pull-ups
inevitably
some asshole comes in and goes fuck
train hard bro hey fuck
i never thought of that i thought i
would just barely train at all and train
super easy to get everything i want and
they're like really you're like no not
really goddamnit get out of my face i'm
already fucking training hard and most
of you are so great interesting if
you're not training hard you got 99
problems
and not being able to do as many
pull-ups is just one of them
and 90 of them are related to you not
training hard enough so that's something
you need to fix on your own
next
band assisted pull-ups okay these are
sort of like oh just do man-assisted
pull-ups a couple problems with them
it's only one modality it's not a whole
lot of variation you can only do them
for so long and like okay let's see if
this worked another big problem is that
bands actually provide more resistance
for you at the bottom and less at the
top which is the opposite of the force
curve that you naturally get from your
anthropometry and muscle function doing
pull-ups okay
as pull-ups get to the top part
that tends to be you know the part that
you could use a little bit more
assistance in and the bottom part of
pull-ups
is actually the most hypertrophic so if
you're big stretching your lats at the
bottom you want more load there not less
so band training can work and it does
but it's limited in a couple of ways as
described and this is not a very
effective tool to increase pull-ups
another one is partner-assisted pull-ups
you say okay i need more volume i need
the specificity of the pull-up movement
can i just get my partner to hold my
feet and sort of help me along with some
of the weight so i get sets of five
build some quality work capacity
eventually it'll translate into strength
and muscle mass and i'll be able to do
sets of one or something that's totally
works but again it's just one modality
it may um
sort of
kind of run its course and depending on
the situation you're in it could be a
productive course
meaningfully marginally productive
really i think it did something and then
one in which there's just no evidence
that it didn't
a big part of this is that there's going
to be some nutritional
recommendations here and some
really zooming out and taking a look at
the pull-ups problem from a big picture
perspective that these things don't do
another one of these things that doesn't
do this doing sets of one to two
pull-ups at a time like if your max is
like four pull-ups and you want to be
able to do like six or seven you may
have heard or on the internet that if
you just do like doubles or singles
that's good pull up training and you can
just do more of those sets and
eventually it won't be that hard and you
can do a rep max and maybe get six or
seven again it works as far as it goes
but it's just one modality and we need a
bigger picture and this let's assume
just didn't work for you another one is
eccentric overload pull-ups you do some
kind of jump
or something to get up to the pull-up
bar top height and then you slowly drift
back down and then you jump up and then
you slowly use your body control drift
back down eccentric overload potentially
good method of training again it has its
own problems not very sustainable it's
not really specific to the vertical
pulling movement it's actually specific
to slowing down the bottom and it's a
fine modality but again we need a bit
more of a reorganization at the very
bottom of this approach and lastly
partial pull-ups people say well you
can't pull up all the way to the bar
just pull up as high as you can and then
eventually it'll get higher yeah it
works pretty well as one modality but
it's not doing us a big picture
re-analysis so
what is this big picture re-analysis
what do we keep saying that
come on just tell me what the hell is
going on well it's basically if we want
to have a serious attempt
at improving pull-up ability
first of all we're assuming you did all
the conventional stuff i just listed
okay all the way from training hard to
partial pull-ups you've tried or enough
of those things to be like i need
something else shit's not working right
now this approach because of its sort of
fundamental
rethinking of the problem nature which
i'll talk about just a bit is it gonna
it's fairly complex it's not very
complicated but there's some ideas in
there and uh it takes months okay
now uh it is much more likely to pay off
in the end but it does take months so
it's up to you to make the trade off
i will say that especially is if you're
an advanced lifter or someone who is
getting some difficulties in in their
usual progress
biting the bullet and understanding that
a more complicated approach that takes
months to reveal its effect is probably
the more dependable approach versus just
hitting your head against the wall and
being like i just need more reps in my
pull-up next week
okay that's a fine wish but if that's
not happening you may have to really
take a big step back right
so what is this sort of complicated
rethinking
here it is
it's essentially three things we have to
do and actually three phases
first is put on vertical pulling muscle
okay like you just want to put on a
bunch of muscle in your i'll talk about
the muscles in a bit lats tears major
centering pulling muscles so that you
know big muscles produce more force
if you see someone who can do a lot of
pull-ups and they have like small skinny
legs usually their back is like
outrageous like
you weigh 150 you got a 200 pound
person's back what the hell is that for
and they're like watch this
they do a climber type of shit so
that's totally a thing that is a very
good idea and you'll notice almost all
of these other things the conventional
attempts that none of that it's just
training there's no saying hey you
should be putting on muscle and the
training is mostly in that close to that
rep range a lot a lot of times very
specific to that rep range that we want
to increase so if it's like oh i can't
do eight pull-ups there's lots of sets
of six and seven there's not a lot of
sets of like you know 10 to 20 to put on
generally a lot of muscle using other
exercises and to be honest all of these
conventional assistance um
methods right here
uh you know they're not that great by
themselves at putting on muscle
right so we use anything we can we'll
talk about that means in a sec to put on
vertical pulling muscles all the muscles
involved need to get bigger then we take
those big muscles in the next phase and
we train them for strength
what strength means is often going to be
rep range specific but we start training
them more in that rep range in which
they're going to be tested more specific
training very solid technique of course
we get lots of practice and at this
point we integrate some dieting as well
to reduce your body fat if you diet very
slowly during a strength phase
especially as regards your pooling
musculature if you eat plenty of protein
eat well train sufficiently hard which
you will be for sure then what you end
up doing is you're losing a bunch of fat
and probably no vertical pulling
strength at all
the thing is you might not gain a net
vertical pulling strength like if we put
you on a pull-down machine after the
strength phase you need to be just the
same pull-downs as before
unlikely you'll probably be a bit
stronger but even if you're just the
same as before that means you lost
essentially zero vertical pulling muscle
while losing g-whiz you know maybe 10
pounds or 20 pounds off of your body
over that course of time if you lose 10
pounds of pure body fat or some
combination of fat and
let's say a tiny bit of muscle that's
not in the vertical pulling complex
you're just a strong vertical pulling
gee it's like taking your assistant pull
up and putting it you know down one
notch that's how much easier the
pull-ups get it's a big deal a lot of
people
why is this in here we could have just
done you know vertical pulling muscle
specific strength and rep ranges and
then peaking by the way the last phase
is peaking done so why are we even doing
the second phase with that diet because
a lot of people who want to do pull-ups
they're carrying some extra body fat and
extra weight and that body fat and
weight has an
unbelievable effect
at how many pull-up reps you can do
because remember this video is all about
doing more pull-up reps
the thing is
body weight affects pull-up reps in a
way you would think linearly like ah if
i lost 10 pounds that's the same thing
as me like taking a 10 pound off my belt
when i do assisted pull-ups like
sorry weighted pull-ups
yes but it feels a bit different and a
lot of times just putting a 10 on your
belt
you can do five pull-ups taking the
intent off fresh you can do like nine or
ten it's really a thing so if you lose
10 pounds off your body a lot of times
your pull-up ability skyrockets and
again i'm coming from the perspective of
you the viewer
i've really tried doing more pull-ups in
a bunch of other ways have not been
successful and i believe you when you
say you really care about doing more
pull-ups
if you care that much maybe you'll
consider the diet and losing the weight
and then you'll be happy to be able to
do more pull-ups right if you say well i
don't want to lose any weight then you
can use this exact program except not
lose the weight it'll work
very well not nearly as well as if you'd
lost me so
after that so vertical pulling muscle is
put on
then we strengthen that muscle to be
more specific in its repetition range as
we lose body fat and then after there's
a short peaking phase usually about a
month where we really just
organize our training to be ready for
the specific task at hand because if you
had you know wanted to increase your
reps and pull ups from five to eight uh
you know yeah
more overall muscle is good and maybe
just with that muscle added but in
without your nervous system learning how
to use it you may get six or seven reps
if you just try to
without the strength uh stuff and
working in specifically close to that
rep range you might get uh maybe seven
or eight pull-ups if you're lucky um
so if you've put on all the muscle and
then you've worked on the specific rep
range maybe you'll put on seven or eight
pull-ups but if you don't peak very well
then what happens is you're just not
there that day your fatigue is a little
too high your specificity is a little
too low and you're just not showing off
your very very best if you peak properly
you used to do five pull-ups you want to
do eight you might hit nine or ten and
you're like oh my god this is incredible
and it's again slide is titled a serious
attempt at increasing number of pull-up
reps so if you like sort of
recreationally care about it
you'll learn some tidbits but this is
like if you're for real for real wanting
to get into it
alright
phase one
putting on vertical pulling muscle
this is going to be a plan that lasts
for several mesocycles so we're talking
about two to four months of this kind of
training you want to build as much
muscle as you can in all of the vertical
vertical pulling musculature which
covers at least the left the tear is
major a few other muscles in the back
the rear delts and the forearm flexors
okay believe it or not the stronger your
biceps are the more pull-ups you can do
i know crazy it's a pulling muscle so
what you want to focus on are exercises
such as pull-downs assisted pull-ups
rows bent barbell and cable face pulls
because they hit your rear delts and
side delts and when you pull up on a
vertical bar it's a very similar
movement and of course curls
right you didn't think you were going to
get to train your biceps with pull up
strength but that's a huge thing right
and i have there if you want to pause
that the typical rep ranges in which
these are most beneficial there's
variation there stimulus to fatigue
ratio always needs to be kept in mind
but these are the rough rep ranges that
most uh
that best promote hypertrophy in these
exercises on average as far as my view
is concerned but whatever does the thing
for you hypertrophy wise here is the
best possible thing so that's what
you're going to do here's a sample plan
of it you'll notice the frequency is
ultra high it's six days a week of pole
training but it's only two exercises per
day and it alters between vertical
pulling and some shoulder work and some
rowing to grow the muscles of the back
more but take a little bit fatigue off
of the vertical pulling thing and also
some some curl stuff right or i i sorry
vertical pulling and curls and then rows
and face pulls and stuff on the other
day so it alternates alternates
alternates that way your back grows very
well overall with at the same time lots
of specificity for vertical pulling lots
of shoulder growth especially rear delts
and lots of biceps really good to go uh
standard all the other rp stuff applies
about designing these mesocycles right
and of course like you might be doing
other training other than this but it's
just two exercises a day so you can
train most of your other stuff like you
want
all right
phase two is essentially sort of a basic
strength phase except modified maybe
better titled specific strength so
for several mesocycles in this phase you
are going to increase your three to six
rep strength in pull-ups as much as
possible
in many cases especially in ones in
which you can do between 0 and 10
pull-ups that's where especially that
3-6 rep range is a really good idea also
during this
couple of mesos you diet
down somewhere between three percent of
your body fat off to as many as much as
10 of your body fat off that's generally
the constraint anything less than three
percent you might not notice anything
greater than 10 would require herculean
effort you might even lose some strength
that would be not good it's a personal
trade-off as far as your concern for
your choice never exceed you know going
faster than one percent body weight loss
per week otherwise you're good to go
during
this time training can focus on
a lot of other exercises and the ones we
have been doing so weighted pull-ups can
come into the mix
if you can do three to six reps
unweighted strict no problem or with a
problem but you can still do them i
would recommend adding every session
every other session two and a half
pounds to a dip and pull-up belt that
over time doesn't seem like much like it
looks really funny when someone sees you
at the gym with a two and a half pounder
on your belt they're like you know your
belt buckle might shut up i'm trying to
get stronger for pull-ups it looks funny
at first then it's a five then it's a
seven and a half then it's ten you know
when you're doing like sets of five with
12 and a half boy oh boy you take that
off fresh you could be doing a set of 10
pull-ups no problem so it's a big deal
it adds up it seems really ridiculous
but it adds up in addition to that
because you're doing this during weight
loss sometimes you're like holy crap
like every session this past month i put
on two and a half and my reps are still
going up a little bit every single
session so this can be really good when
mixed with weight loss and of course
different rep ranges there for
everything else more of those rep ranges
are now strength oriented we're going to
get our body to be as good as possible
at contracting those muscles ultra hard
and make us a very very strong we have
the muscle mass now it's time to make it
a little bit stronger
sample plan notice the pulling days have
been condensed into monday wednesday
friday uh you can look at the structure
there feel free to pause it just an
example but a way of doing things
all right
lastly is the peaking phase okay
so the peaking phase
is going to take about four weeks
and it's going to be
honed in for just really one thing
i know it's a long time for one thing
to be
do as many pull-ups at the end as
possible that's the whole goal and it's
like a four week phase of getting your
body sort of retuned to be able to do
that or tuned for the first time to be
able to do that
you don't have to have it last four
weeks four weeks is if you're the most
serious possible about that day being
really good you can do two you can do
one week of this you can do two weeks
you do three weeks and you could do four
dealer's choice right
so
if you're only doing assisted pull-ups
for your training now and you want to do
your first real pull-up or multiple
pull-ups your peaking phase is going to
be a lot like that of a power lifter or
a weight lifter all right you're
essentially like going to be doing
singles and doubles and shit like that
and triples uh with various assistants
and then eventually you're going to try
a real pull up right so super low rep
training why because it's specific to
what we want to do you have to do the
rep range that's specific for the test
that you want to do
if you want to do roughly three to six
pull-ups right as whatever your goal is
then you'll probably more or less repeat
your last strength meso
and you'll lower the assistance volume
considerably at the end to drop away a
ton of fatigue and then test your best
ability to do pull-ups
and
if
you want to do
seven or more pull-ups up to gee i want
to do 20 plus or whatever you'll repeat
well 20 plus if you do 20 plus you're
really good at pull-ups
we have a different periodization scheme
for you so up to 15 pull-ups we'll say
if you're really struggling to get 10 11
12 13 14 etc
you
will repeat also something very similar
to your strength phase but you're going
to keep your average reps in this phase
around the target that you want to hit
don't worry an example is incoming so
for one to three pull-ups is your goal
at the end of this whole process
here's how
basically right over here here's how
your
typical week would go notice it's very
similar to the strength phase however
the repetition ranges are very low
so
monday the main exercise is pull-ups in
your whatever competition grip however
you want to test them
you're going to do sets of one to two
with assistance because you can't do a
single pull-up yet
or uh if you can do like one pull-up or
something like that or two pull-ups you
just wanna do maybe three or four or one
to three or two to three then maybe
you'll use like a two and a half or
something as a weight belt or just your
body very close to how challenging it's
gonna be just a few reps short of your
actual goal right and slowly over time
you make that more difficult as the
weeks go on maybe up to three weeks of
this
or sorry four weeks of this wednesday
okay the second day of the week
we instead of doing sets of one to two a
little harder we go a little lighter and
do whatever we're capable of doing
whether it's with assistance with a band
with help by ourselves for sets of two
to three and then we have the assistance
work after
and then
friday
we need some variation we can do more
pulling but more overhand pulling all
the time all the time super heavy it's
going to irritate our elbows potentially
our shoulders so we want to switch to
another variation it doesn't matter if
it's parallel or underhand just don't do
the same pull-ups and even if you're
doing pull-ups wide grip maybe doing
some narrow grip might actually be the
thing that does but a little bit of a
change some more assistance moves now
how do you do your peaking when you
actually come into peak so whatever week
you pick to peak
the week before what you want to do is
take out
all of the asterisks
little exercises completely the week
before
so what that's going to look like is
let's say week 4 you test
in week two you're going to have this
with all the sets and everything like
that in week three you're only going to
come in monday and do a set of one to
two pull-ups or sets of one to two
bullets however many sets you you've
sort of worked up to this time not a
crazy amount whatever sets you worked up
to this time maybe one more set or
something
wednesday you'll do pull-ups again
slightly different rep range friday
you'll underhand pull-ups slightly
different rep range
then that next monday you come in
you've been training very heavy or hard
but at such low volume that your fatigue
has fallen that entire time
you come in
you do your warm-up very well you don't
want to skip the warm-up when the more
actually potentiates your performance
this is your test session super
important to do a really good warm-up
do
one full pull-up
okay
if you if your goal is to ever just do
one full pull-up you just succeeded
congratulations
if your goal is to do two to four or
something like that pull-ups just do one
full pull-up get off of the pull-up
station and rest four to eight minutes
that's a long time right until you
really feel like you have no fatigue but
you're still nice and warm still ready
to go and then try a rep max and maybe
you'll get three reps uh in the pull-up
and that'll be amazing congratulations
slow clap you did it that's how that
peaking phase would work
now if you want to peak for three or six
pull-ups it's very similar except take a
look at monday
three to four sets
weighted okay
remember you're going for three to six
so three to four pull-ups or two to four
pull-ups you'll be able to do with a
little bit of weight slowly increase
that weight even during the peaking
times
wednesday you'll do pull-ups of some
kind in the five to six rep range no
weight and potentially some assistance
if you need okay so we're doing the
lower end of that three to six we're
doing the higher end of that three six
monday lower end higher end wednesday
and then friday
still the higher or actually the whole
range three to six but underhand okay
and a lot of times underhand pull-ups
are easier and they don't bother your
joints as much if you've been used to
overhanded center etc same as last time
again
in the week before the test you remove
all the extra volume so you just have
the three pull-ups monday wednesday
friday that monday you come in warm up
super well
you do one pull up
with as much load as you think you can
do for a rough one rm 90 95 percent of
your 100m we want a massive potentiation
because if you do a close to 1rm pull up
successfully all the way up and down
when you get up don't just jump off go
all the way down for the big stretch and
then let go
that
wakes up your nervous system and aligns
all of its abilities so well that after
resting 48 minutes 48 four to eight
minutes after that set you are going to
be able to smash a crapload of pull-ups
then you take the belt off take all the
weight off and then go to town and do as
many pull-ups as you can that's your max
test hopefully it goes well
congratulations now you have friends and
people at the gym who are interested in
you sexually even
if a girl can do that many pull-ups what
can't she do someone might think about
you all right
lastly
if
you're going to be doing more than seven
pull-ups
up to about 15.
north of 15 this stuff kind of changes
and the periodization looks a little bit
different for higher reps but you can
still do this and still do really well
with
so 7 to 15-ish pull-ups
again very similar situation
except
it's goal weight related right or sorry
rep goal related so let's say your goal
you've done eight before
and you've taken this time and now you
want 10 plus
so
you do pull ups on monday three to six
repetitions under your rep goal so if
your rep goal is
10
then you're gonna be doing sets of oh i
don't know around five pull-ups or
something like that right
uh maybe around oh somewhere between
four pull-ups and seven pull-ups
not dogmatic somewhere in that region
but remember that's not low rar
sorry that's not high rr that's not very
far from failure that's very close to
failure so you have to weight that
pull-up so it's a weighted pull-up
you're doing heavier than you would
encounter in your actual test
just by three to six
on wednesday
you do also heavy pull-ups but a little
less heavy one to three repetitions
under your eventual goal so if your goal
is 10 pull-ups you could do as many as
sets uh sets of nine pull-ups okay up to
as many as nine with some weight okay so
that's very very very specific very very
close but just a little bit heavier
right and then
friday you do some kind of assisted
pull-up which kind is up to you
hopefully have assisted pull-up machine
access if you don't get somebody to hold
your feet if you don't have that get a
band which sucks but whatever uh if you
don't have any of that then uh
pull-downs for these reps what reps are
they well it's sets of one to three reps
above your target reps so if your goal
is ten pull-ups and when you're doing
the peak
this can be like uh you know a set of
twelve to begin with with your partner
holding your legs or assisted pull-ups
close but a little bit above so
basically we have three days in our week
monday wednesday friday and this plan
monday we're doing much heavier but
slightly lower reps below where you want
to be
and or sorry significantly lower ups
very heavy wednesday is just under the
rep range you want to be a little
heavier and then friday's just over it
so we're taking care of specificity by
flirting around with it very very close
to it but we're not psychologically
burning out by practicing our pull-up
rep maxes all the time that's something
you don't want to get into in most cases
max testing should occur very
infrequently it shouldn't occur all the
time if it's like oh i worked up to a
daily max that wasn't high rpe there are
ways to do that but all out full-out
maxes which this would get very linearly
close to if you did not a good idea so
we stay a little south we stay a little
north we build some very big strength
because it always helps to be overall
stronger and then when we get to
close to what we're doing we're already
there in that specificity range and when
you do your normal unweighted pull ups
for many reps as possible it's going to
feel very comfortable very similar
except easier because most of the time
you're doing much harder things right
so
the test will work like the following
okay so oh i'm sorry i forget to mention
one thing so it says barbell rows and
it's instead of the rep range it says
like at like what the hell does that
mean well sets
should be done at this point around your
target pull-up duration
so for example
if it takes you 28 seconds to do 10
pull-ups or nine pull-ups
and you want to be able to do 11
pull-ups and you measured you looked
your videos every pull-up is whatever
like roughly oh something like two to
three seconds then you think okay okay
okay so it's going to take me basically
33 to 35 seconds to do like 12 good
pull-ups
then all of the rep ranges you pick for
all of your exercises is going to be a
number of reps that gets you contracting
the muscle hard for roughly 30 to 35
seconds
that's going to be very different rep
ranges based on the exercise and based
on your execution of it so you just want
to let's say for bent rows if you know
you measure you measure the time you
just do a set of bent rows for 15 just
as a test weeks before this
and 15 reps it takes you like 40 seconds
to do and 10 reps you looked at your
video and you said oh 10 reps it took me
like oh about you know 12 seconds or
something or sorry like 22 seconds
somewhere between there you can scroll
over to see where rep 12 is and you're
like ah around 35 seconds all right
sweet so perfect but it could be that
you go through faster with rows and rep
20s at 35 seconds then you do sets of
20.
we want that specificity to be of
muscular contraction time because we
want a very similar effect a very
similar burn a very similar buffering
capacity to develop having to fight
through those metabolites
for that exact duration or very similar
duration because when we get to the
actual test and we have to go as hard as
we can for 30 to 35 seconds especially
at the end where it's to the limit then
we want to be very very well trained in
all of our exercises to fatigue around
that time close to it so we can be
really really good that's the deal
so that's what you do
similar very similar rep maxing at the
end you take your hat last week of this
and you dump all of your assistance work
so only the pull-ups remain you do a sum
total of like
three days of only pull-ups for three to
four sets each time super easy compared
to what you're used to here super
fucking easy
you drop a bunch of fatigue but you
still feel strong you show up on monday
or of that next week
you go up to a two to four pull-up rep
max
so if you can do more than ten pull-ups
what i want you to do is put enough
weight warm up of course put enough
weight for the last warm-up onto your
belt that roughly gets you a super hard
close to max set of three
do that you don't have to do it to
failure but like a solid like 90 off
maybe half a rep in reserve or something
like that
do that
chill
for 48 minutes then get on the bar with
no body weight at all and do sorry no
body weight at all no extra weight i'll
be a ghost pull up
no extra weight get on after 48 minutes
48 minutes and then boom just go go go
go right
that really is kind of the formula
there what kind of results can you
expect from
first it's going to be a lot of work i
mean this is a very serious attempt at
growing the vertical pulling musculature
strengthening the vertical pulling
muscular generally and then
strengthening and expressing it in such
a way that you peak properly it's a big
deal right
by the way
if you wanted to modify this i'll just
fuck it i'll just give you the
information now if you're doing 15 or
more pull-ups you can get a very very
good effect here by just taking the
strength phase and designing it like we
sort of designed uh this peaking phase
for face uh three sample for seven plus
pull ups you basically do uh monday just
under
the uh so something quite quite a bit
heavier wednesday just under a little
bit heavier just under those reps so
significantly under the wraps just under
and then just over on friday so if
you're doing sets of 20 it's like uh
sets of 15 or 15 at first uh 18 on the
first and then assisted pull pull-ups
with 22 reps or something like that
right that's how it would work and you
can adapt that to pretty much any
pull-up range above 50. right here's the
deal it's going to take a lot of work
and you have to have to have to modify
the plan in an auto-regulated fashion as
far as its volume potentially even its
frequency frequency could be too much or
too little definitely the volume has to
be modified by performance and soreness
if you're still sore coming into
sessions lower the volume so that
doesn't happen if your performance is
tailing off every week and a half you're
doing too much do less so your
performance can peak over the course of
the entire measure four weeks up or
something and then deload right you will
be delivering everything else is as
normal training
in this method using this method it is
very possible
to put five reps or more onto your
pull-up abilities within a four to eight
month time span now
that's not crazy at all right
if someone said hey you can put up five
pull-ups on your abilities you know in
48 months some people who've never done
a pull-up could be like oh my god that's
incredible and for them that might
actually happen right that may actually
be really good news but for many people
you know if you can do five to ten
pull-ups ten to fifteen
five more pull-ups ability over the
course of 48 months especially
if you uh come from background of like
just getting through your noob gains and
you're putting on a rep every week for
pull-ups or something for a bunch of
weeks
gee you know it's not going to be super
impressive to you but here's the really
big deal and how we'll finish off this
video
you're doing this because
based on the second slide of this entire
video
the other shit just didn't work
right if other shit didn't work you put
some bands on you listen to the people
at the gym you got some partner assisted
shit you did it a bit it just didn't
fucking work maybe you added half a rep
to your pull-up max over six weeks and
you're just like what fuck this like i
guess it's just not in the cards for me
to ever be able to do a lot of pull-ups
that might not be true until you try
this right right
so
as usual
take away the concept that we've been
talking about and build your own plan
based on your own preferences recovery
ability timelines etc
good luck and i'll see you when you can
do more pull-ups and if you run this
protocol and you see me at your gym at
some point and if you did a bunch of
pull-ups with it and you hit pr's
absolutely come up to me talk to me i'll
love it i'll sign your sign your titties
or whatever if you didn't actually have
success with this plan i don't ever want
to ever make eye contact with me in the
gym you don't know my name i don't know
you i'm gonna have the unabomber glasses
on and the hat hoodie
we're out
you
