hey folks dr mike israel here for
renaissance periodization
video number one today in fat loss
dieting made
simple super simple and we're starting
out with the most basic step step one
standardizing your intake so here's the
deal
you want a diet to lose fat which of
course makes sense
welcome to a club it's a huge club
tons and tons of people want a diet to
lose fat
and unfortunately the vast majority of
them will do a bunch of stuff wrong and
some will still succeed
some do more right than wrong some do
more right than others
but we want you guys watching these
videos to have the best chance of
success
so maybe if we catch you early enough or
you know early enough before your next
fat loss phase
we want you to get things right from
the get-go for a change okay and
in order to get things right in order to
build a diet plan for yourself which
you'll be able to do watching this video
we have to know where you're starting
from
yes we could just give you a cookie
cutter plan and say hey use this and
you'll probably have great results and
that might even be true
but you get the best results and have
the process be the most smooth and most
likely to be successful
a lot of times what's good is starting
from a place where you know where you're
at plans can be very different based on
initial conditions so
figuring out where you're at is a real
good thing at
right up front how do we know where
you're at
well you have to track your daily intake
for probably a few days even maybe a
week or two
how do you do this you can do it
manually i track all my proteins carbs
and fats just on my phone
on the iphone notes app i'm told that
i'm
20 years behind the times that's
probably true tons of apps out there
that do this
myfitnesspal great app to track your
intake because it's got
a huge list of foods you can pretty much
find anything you need in there
some of the food labels are not so
accurate most are very accurate
but you can get on there it's easy to
use track your intake now mind you
you're not making any changes you're
still eating the same stuff you always
did
all you're doing is tracking your food
and the numbers we're really interested
in is the amount of protein carbs and
fats
that you eat every day on average okay
so if you know how to count macros and
you're comfortable myfitnesspal is a
great tool
if you're new to counting macros or you
don't even know what the heck macros are
no big deal
then you can try our healthy eating made
simple series
that we already have posted to youtube
you search that or we'll
post a link for you and it'll teach you
all about how to cut macros
so once you look through that and you're
okay
healthy eating is great but i want to
lose fat you can come back here now
after a week or two of doing this
remember we are not making any willful
changes at all no changes
just tracking you will know how much
protein
how many carbs and how much fat you're
taking in daily
and you'll have like a weekly or two
week average okay
that's really good because that amount
of food
will serve us the foundation for turning
your current diet
into a very effective fat loss diet
specifically
we'll know how much food you're eating
we can wiggle the amounts a little bit
or reduce it in an intelligent way so
the macros at the end for your fat loss
diet
are real good for losing fat for
continuing to provide you with as much
energy and recovery as possible
not disrupting your sleep and making
sure you still have all the muscle that
you built
underneath fat loss diet not necessarily
just a weight loss diet
so this process takes usually one or two
weeks
and big idea here is to just figure out
how much you're eating on average
right however another part of the
process is really good
is it sort of gets you in tune with the
idea of tracking
tracking is going to be something we're
going to use through the entire fat loss
process
because it's just you know when we have
a plan tracking tells us how close we
are to the plan it allows us to really
hit our goals
tracking is a little stressful at times
and it can be
especially if it's new to you it can be
like this new thing that you have to do
like oh
damn it i forgot to log my meals for
today uh what did i eat if you're not in
the habit of tracking
and you have to do two things start
tracking and change your intake to start
a fat loss diet at the beginning
uh that kind of stinks man that's that's
two things that's a lot of cognitive
bandwidth
but if you just start tracking and you
still eat whatever the hell you want
whatever normal stuff you eat
that's great because by the time several
weeks later when we actually start
changing
your intake to make it a fat loss diet
you're already super used to tracking
and it's no big deal it's just one
change at a time then
right so that's it step one
is to track for a few weeks and get a
real good understanding of how much food
you eat
next time in the next video we'll talk
about choosing
better foods versus or foods that are
more conducive to fat loss
rather than foods that are less
conducive and then we'll start taking
that
serious dive into or the deep dive into
very serious
fat loss mode see you in the next video
